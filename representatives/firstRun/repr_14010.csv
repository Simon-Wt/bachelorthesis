864433,14010,11104,"Satellite image interpretation for tectonic analysis of the Urmia region, northwestern Iran",2012,Lake Urmia in northwestern Iran (West Azerbaijan Province) is one of the great hypersaline lakes of the world. The approximate area of this salty lake is 5000 km 2  with average depth of 6 m. The Urmia Lake has shrunk dramatically due to several factors during last decades. In the Lake Urmia region a Cenozoic island arc complex within the Zagros Orogenic Belt was formed by northeastward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic plate beneath central Iran. The lake is therefore located in the fore-arc basin of the Sahand Magmatic Arc (Fig. 1).
1003113,14010,11104,A novel approach in regional tuna fisheries management using low resolution satellite data: A case study for the Gulf of Guinea,2012,"The tuna fisheries in the Gulf of Guinea provides huge economic benefits through fish trade and food security. The region, an important spawning site and migratory path for three dominant tuna species i.e. Skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), Yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and Bigeye (Thunnus obesus), has high incidence of illegal fishing practices, in addition to poor surveillance and monitoring of fisheries resources. Adopting conservation methods for effective management of the tuna fisheries requires an understanding of their thermal preference, foraging behaviour and migratory patterns. Using tuna catch data from 2004 to 2006 in the eastern equatorial Atlantic we have described the spatial distribution of tuna catch and thermal range associated with these distribution from low resolution remotely sensed sea surface temperature data. Tuna in the equatorial Atlantic are concentrated at the major upwelling centers off the coast of Ghana and equatorial Atlantic at surface temperatures of 23 to 28°C."
2381204,14010,11104,Study of the Oyu Tolgoi Cu-Au deposit characteristics using mult-spectral ASTER data,2012,"In this study, ASTER data was analyzed to extract spectral characteristics of the Oyu Tolgoi porphyry Cu-Au deposit region in Mongolia. We proposed extraction model of alteration zone and silicate mineral zone by using various band ratio logical operator. The central Oyu tolgoi deposit is associated with advanced argillic alteration. The south and southwest deposits are associated with phyllic alteration. Khan Bogd is associated with alkali feldspar minerals. The results show that these techniques have potentials in mineral prognostication."
1524550,14010,8441,Control systems engineering for understanding and optimizing smoking cessation interventions,2013,"Cigarette smoking remains a major public health issue. Despite a variety of treatment options, existing intervention protocols intended to support attempts to quit smoking have low success rates. An emerging treatment framework, referred to as adaptive interventions in behavioral health, addresses the chronic, relapsing nature of behavioral health disorders by tailoring the composition and dosage of intervention components to an individual's changing needs over time. An important component of a rapid and effective adaptive smoking intervention is an understanding of the behavior change relationships that govern smoking behavior and an understanding of intervention components' dynamic effects on these behavioral relationships. As traditional behavior models are static in nature, they cannot act as an effective basis for adaptive intervention design. In this article, behavioral data collected daily in a smoking cessation clinical trial is used in development of a dynamical systems model that describes smoking behavior change during cessation as a self-regulatory process. Drawing from control engineering principles, empirical models of smoking behavior are constructed to reflect this behavioral mechanism and help elucidate the case for a control-oriented approach to smoking intervention design."
2571970,14010,11104,Flower species identification and coverage estimation based on hyperspectral remote sensing data,2011,"Monitoring grass species and coverage accurately makes a significant contribution to species diversity research and sustainable development of grassland ecosystem. Plants grown in grassland usually own unique spectral characteristics in florescence. Compared with the nutrient stage, species are more easily identified during florescence. In this study, flowers such as Galium verum Linn., Hemerocallis citrina Baroni, Serratula centauroides Linn., Clematis hexapetala Pall., Lilium concolor var. pulchellum, Lilium pumilum and Artemisia frigida Willd. Sp. Pl. were identified, using some canopies spectra analysis and feature extraction methods. Validation shows that when the coverage of flowers is greater than 10%, the accuracy of identification methods will be higher than 90%. Based on this result, linear unmixing model is adopted to calculate the area ratios of flowers in quadrates. Results show that linear unmixing model is an effective method for estimating the coverage of grassland flowers with the mean retrieval error of about 4%."
1633972,14010,11104,Remote sensing study of the seasonal distribution of phytoplankton groups in the South China Sea,2012,"Distribution of phytoplankton groups in the South China Sea (SCS) is retrieved from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data using a classification method named PHYSAT. Four major phytoplankton groups including haptophytes, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus-like cyanobacteria and diatoms are distinguished. It is found that the Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus-like cyanobacteria are the dominant species over the deep basin in the SCS, while the haptophytes and diatoms prevail along the coastal area, which is consistent with the previous reports. We also compare monthly distribution of phytoplankton groups. From November to February, Prochlorococcus is the dominant over the entire SCS. The haptophytes is the dominant species along the coast of China. The dominant species is diatoms along the southeast of Vietnam. From March to June, both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus-like cyanobacteria cover the entire SCS and the area dominated by haptophytes decreases. Instead of haptophytes, the diatoms become the dominant phytoplankton group along the coast of China. Large patches of Synechococcus-like cyanobacteria cover continental slope of the northwestern SCS during July and August. Haptophytes and Prochlorococcus accumulate in the east of Vietnam in August. The Synechococcus-like cyanobacteria starts to extend towards the southern of SCS during September."
1715239,14010,8441,"Optogenetic control of live skeletal muscles: Non-invasive, wireless, and precise activation of muscle tissues",2013,"Optogenetics is an emerging new technology for controlling live cell function with light. Skeletal muscles are genetically coded to express light-sensitive proteins so that the cell's behavior may be altered by illuminating a targeted portion of the cell. Optogenetic control provides a non-invasive, wireless, and fast control method with high spatiotemporal resolution. This paper presents the technology, experimental test, and potential applications of optogenetic control of skeletal muscles. The authors' research team has recently succeeded in controlling the contraction of skeletal muscle tissues with light by using the light-sensitive protein Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2). Precursors of skeletal cells, myoblasts, are transfected with ChR2, creating ion channels on the cell membrane that conduct cations when exposed to blue light. Experiments show that targeted skeletal muscles are activated rapidly and precisely with high spatiotemporal resolution. Dynamics of optogenetically controlled skeletal muscles are characterized based on system identification. Two potential applications are addressed. One is muscle-on-a-chip drug screening for evaluating potential hazards of a drug on muscular function, and the other is multi-DOF robotic devices powered by bio-artificial muscles controlled with targeted light illumination."
1578953,14010,8441,Passive Force/Velocity Field Control for contour tracking of constrained robots,2013,"Passive Force Velocity Field Control (PFVFC) renders tracking along tangent of the contour, with low normal velocity regime, which is of particular interest for constrained tasks. Despite the evident advantageous characteristics of PFVFC, the original pioneering approach by Li&Horowitz has shown limitation for implementation. In this paper, a simpler yet faster and robust PFVFC is proposed for exponential contour force-velocity-position tracking. A regressor-free second order sliding mode is presented to produce an invariant error manifold for all time and for any initial condition. In this way, the robot velocity is immersed all time in the Passive Force-Velocity Field (PFVF), which is based on a fuzzy aggregation of orthogonal decomposition of the holonomic constraint that models the contour. In contrast to the original approach, our scheme does neither require the virtual fly wheel subsystem nor robot dynamic model nor derivative of the field. In this sense we argue our approach stands for a novel PFVFC, not a betterment nor extension of the Li&Horowitz one. Simulations for 2D and 3D robots are presented and discussed, which show the feasibility and viability of the proposed approach."
2482162,14010,11104,What is the value added of 4 bands within the submetric remote sensing of tropical coastscape? QuickBird-2 vs WorldView-2,2011,"The seamless tropical coastscape was investigated in comparing remotely-sensed by-products derived from the spaceborne 8 band WorldView-2 (WV-2) and the 4 band QuickBird-2-like (QB-2-like) sensors. The value added of the 4 bands allowed both land and water surveys to be significantly improved. The WV-2-derived NDVI means were more correlated (R 2 =0.96) with in situ “greenness” than those of QB-2-like (R 2 =0.89), and the WV-2-derived NDVI standard deviations were systematically inferior to those of QB-2-like. The cross-validation of the bathymetric products indicated a better performance of WV-2 (R 2 =0.76; maximum depth, 9.4 m) than QB-2-like (R 2 =0.74; maximum depth, 8.9 m). Results of classification showed that land cover was best mapped by WV-2 with the Neural Network algorithm (8 classes, kappa=0.92), and seafloor cover (resulting from an underwater radiative transfer model) was best classified by WV-2 trained with Support Vector Machine (6 classes, kappa=0.76). These improvements were then discussed based upon their spectral properties."
2252404,14010,8441,Hybrid model predictive control for optimizing gestational weight gain behavioral interventions,2013,"Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) represents a major public health issue. In this paper, we pursue a control engineering approach to the problem by applying model predictive control (MPC) algorithms to act as decision policies in the intervention for assigning optimal intervention dosages. The intervention components consist of education, behavioral modification and active learning. The categorical nature of the intervention dosage assignment problem dictates the need for hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) schemes, ultimately leading to improved outcomes. The goal is to design a controller that generates an intervention dosage sequence which improves a participant's healthy eating behavior and physical activity to better control GWG. An improved formulation of self-regulation is also presented through the use of Internal Model Control (IMC), allowing greater flexibility in describing self-regulatory behavior. Simulation results illustrate the basic workings of the model and demonstrate the benefits of hybrid predictive control for optimized GWG adaptive interventions."
1815626,14010,8441,Steady state and Transient State Identification for flow rate on a pilot-scale absorption column,2013,"A computationally simple method is demonstrated for automated identification of probable steady state and probable transient state in noisy flow rate process signals of a pilot-scale absorption column. The method is shown effective even when noise amplitude changes, and to several types of disturbance."
1704325,14010,8441,Intersample ripple resulting from discrete-time feedforward control,2013,"Adding feedforward controllers to feedback-only control systems can often improve the transient response performance. In the literature several architectures have been proposed, which combine feedback and feedforward controls together, such as Feedforward Closed-Loop Inverse (FFCLI) and Feedforward Plant Inverse (FFPI). In this paper, we investigate discrete-time feedforward control designs and show how some designs lead to large intersample ripple in the response of the continuous-time plant that is being controlled. If the feedforward controller cancels high frequency zeros with small damping factors in the discretized plant, large intersample ripple can result. Ignoring such zeros in the feedforward controller will suppress intersample ripple significantly, while slightly slowing the response. In this work, this phenomenon is demonstrated with a second-order plant and a fourth-order Torsional Disk System (TDS) plant."
1497581,14010,8441,Automated steady and transient state identification in noisy processes,2013,"A computationally simple method is developed, analyzed, and demonstrated for automated identification of probable steady state and probable transient state in noisy process signals. The method is insensitive to noise variance. The tutorial will develop the equations, reveal the execution code (5 lines, explicit calculations, low storage), discuss implementation and critical values, qualitatively compare the approach to other approaches, and provide analysis with respect to computational burden, sensitivity, and average run length."
1401822,14010,8228,On effectiveness of integrating intermittent resources and electricity vehicles in the smart grid,2013,"The smart grid shall not only integrate the intermittent resources (IRs) to meet the diverse demands of users and reduce the greenhouse gas emission, but also integrate Electricity Vehicles (EVs) as the energy storage facility to smooth the bulk power generation over time. In this paper, we model and analyze the impact of integrating IRs and EVs on the bulk power generation in the smart grid. In particular, we introduce the reliability ratio to quantify the power generation capacity of intermittent resources and model the process of charging and discharging of EVs as a queuing system. We extend the Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) and include the reliability limit of IRs and the number of EVs in the power generation dispatch process and formally analyze the effect of IRs and EVs on the bulk power generation. We conduct extensive simulation and our data shows that increasing IRs can decrease the bulk generation and the curve of bulk generation over time becomes smooth as the number of EVs increases."
1644072,14010,8441,Normalized unscented Kalman filter and normalized unscented RTS smoother for nonlinear state-space model identification,2013,"A Kalman filter (KF) and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother (RTSS) provide the minimum mean square estimates of states for linear state-space models with additive Gaussian system and observation noises given a series of the past, current, and future observations. When the noise statistics such as the variances are unknown, initially normalizing the KF and RTSS algorithms by the total of the unknown variances provides new state estimation algorithms. We call these algorithms the normalized KF and normalized RTSS and on the basis of the log-likelihoods scored by the multiple trials with varied parameters, we can effectively identify the unknown system and observation noise variances. In this paper, we present the same normalization technique for nonlinear KF and RTSS algorithms named the unscented KF and unscented RTSS. In the same way as the normalized KF and normalized RTSS, these new normalized unscented KF and normalized unscented RTSS algorithms make it possible to estimate the unknown noise variances of nonlinear state-space models. Because it often happens that the noise variances are unknown in actual analysis cases, these algorithms are considerably effective from the aspect of the application viewpoints. The performance was confirmed by experiments using artificially generated data."
2239482,14010,8441,A real-time control system architecture for industrial power amplifiers,2013,"Power amplifiers are a highly important component in a range of industrial applications, such as, servo-drives, magnetic resonance imaging, energy systems, and audio. The control system for power amplifiers should satisfy a range of requirements, e.g., offset free tracking, stability margins, and fast transient response. The intrinsic switching behaviour of modern power amplifiers and the sampled nature of digital control systems represent additional design challenges. This paper presents a complete development cycle for a cascaded digital control system for an industrial current amplifier. The inner control loop contains an optimal state-feedback controller and observer to ensure fast transient response. To guarantee reference-to-output frequency-domain specifications an outer control-loop is designed. Lastly, a rate-limiter is added to prevent clamping in the control input and overstress of the amplifier components. A special attention is given to synchronization in between sub-assemblies of the control system within the FPGA implementation. The paper concludes with the real-time measurements and comparison with the original control systems of the industrial amplifier."
2270170,14010,8441,Enhancement of practical applicability of optimal control of a nonlinear process,2013,"This paper makes a step towards practical applicability of the optimal control for industrial penicillin production. Using the nonlinear gradient method as the key optimization tool, two ways of measurement feedback incorporation into the optimization procedure are proposed. Firstly, the receding horizon approach (whose linear variant is widely spreading in the field of operation of various industrial processes) is investigated considering different lengths of optimization horizon. Secondly, the shrinking horizon approach inspired by the character of the solved task with terminal criterion is examined. In order to make the latter comparable to the receding horizon approach, various sampling periods of the input signal are considered. Utilization of the nonlinear continuous time model of the controlled process clearly distinguishes this paper from the earlier publications. The behavior of both approaches is tested on a set of numerical experiments with the focus on performance under constrained computational resources. The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of shrinking horizon approach and its strong computational restriction resistance."
1994136,14010,8441,"An experimental comparison of PI, inversion, and damping control for high performance nanopositioning",2013,"This article compares the performance of three feedback control methodologies for high performance nanopositioning applications. Integral resonance damping control is a new approach for controlling mechanical systems. In this approach, the system resonances are actively damped rather than inverted which maximizes the closed-loop bandwidth and provides robustness to changes in the resonance frequencies. This technique is comprehensively compared to the standard methods of PI and inversion control in a practical environment. A five times improvement in the settling-time and bandwidth is demonstrated."
2388494,14010,8441,Capturability of Augmented Proportional Navigation (APN) guidance with nonlinear engagement dynamics,2013,"Proportional Navigation (PN) and its variants are widely used guidance philosophies. However, in the presence of target maneuver, PN guidance law is effective only for a restrictive set of initial geometries. To account for target maneuvers, the concept of Augmented Proportional Navigation (APN) guidance law was introduced and analyzed in a linearized interceptor-target engagement framework presented in literature. However, there is no work in the literature, that addresses the capturability performance of the APN guidance law in a nonlinear engagement framework. This paper presents such an analysis and obtains the conditions for capturability. It also shows that a shorter time of interception is obtained when APN is formulated in the nonlinear framework as proposed in this paper. Simulation results are given to support the theoretical findings."
1611471,14010,8441,Root locus for a controller class that yields quadratic gain parameterization,2013,"We present rules for constructing the root locus for a linear feedback system, where the closed-loop denominator polynomial is quadratic in the root-locus parameter k. These quadratic root-locus rules apply to a class of controllers that are rational functions of k. We provide controller design examples to demonstrate the quadratic root locus. For example, we use quadratic root locus to high-gain stabilize the triple integrator; this is not possible with classical root locus."
2241383,14010,8441,Application of Conjugate Unscented Transform in source parameters estimation,2013,"A polynomial chaos based minimum variance method is introduced to solve inverse problems. Two different set of quadrature points, Conjugate Unscented Transform and Gauss Legendre quadrature points, are being used to perform the estimation process. The main concentration of this paper is to show the efficiency of Conjugate Unscented Transform points versus Gauss Legendre quadrature scheme. For validation purposes, an advection - diffusion simulation code, SCIPUFF (Second-order Closure Integrated PUFF) is being used as a modeling testbed to study the effect of both these quadrature schemes on solution of an inverse problem. Simulation results show efficiency of Conjugate Unscented Transform versus Gauss-Legendre quadratures."
2072241,14010,8441,Reconstruction of directed networks from consensus dynamics,2013,"This paper addresses the problem of identifying the topology of an unknown, weighted, directed network running a consensus dynamics. We propose a methodology to reconstruct the network topology from the dynamic response when the system is stimulated by a wide-sense stationary noise of unknown power spectral density. The method is based on a node-knockout, or grounding, procedure wherein the grounded node broadcasts zero without being eliminated from the network. In this direction, we measure the empirical cross-power spectral densities of the outputs between every pair of nodes for both grounded and ungrounded consensus to reconstruct the unknown topology of the network. We also establish that in the special cases of undirected and purely unidirectional networks, the reconstruction does not need grounding. Finally, we extend our results to the case of a directed network assuming a general dynamics, and prove that the developed method can detect edges and their direction."
2179147,14010,8441,Practical smooth minimum time trajectory planning for path following robotic manipulators,2013,"Previous computation approaches of smooth minimum time trajectory for path following robotic manipulators either cannot fully utilize the maximum ability of machines, fail to minimum machine time, or cannot be computed efficiently because of the nonlinearity of problem formulations. In this paper, an efficient computation approach is proposed that has been designed as solving a convex optimization problem to generate smooth minimum time trajectory while utilizing the maximum ability of machines."
1604712,14010,8441,Building energy model reduction for model predictive control using OpenStudio,2013,"Model-based predictive control for buildings is an active area of research. Significant effort has been placed on developing accurate and computationally efficient reduced-order models that can be implemented in predictive controllers. During a building's design and construction process, detailed building models are often created by experienced building modelers. These models are often too complex to be directly implemented in control applications. Reducing these models to low-order models can be time-consuming and require additional skills beyond those possessed by building modelers. In this paper we demonstrate simple reduction of building models using the OpenStudio analysis framework in a script-based environment. OpenStudio is a cross-platform tool for modeling and analysis of building energy systems. A reduced-order model is created for a simple building and an economic-based model predictive controller is used to minimize summertime cooling costs in an electricity market with real-time pricing."
2050565,14010,8441,An optimal control for a novel ABS based on vehicle dynamic load transfer effect for reducing stopping distance,2013,"This article presents an analysis of braking stopping distance performances for a vehicle with an Anti-lock Braking System. We propose a novel electronic braking optimal control for passenger cars based on dynamic and transient factors between the tire/wheel and the vehicle. To improve Anti-lock Braking System braking stopping distance performance, in fact, in this study we take advantage of the vehicle dynamic load transfer effect between tire/wheel and vehicle systems [1]. Novelty of this work lies in presenting a global optimal numerical solution of the optimal control problem that minimizes braking stopping distance of the Anti-lock Braking System by applying nonlinear dynamic programming [2] to a fifth order nonlinear vehicle model with dynamic load transfer. Challenges and benefits of the proposed optimal strategy in terms of reduced braking stopping distance are provided through Matlab numerical optimizations and CarSim high-fidelity simulations."
1724329,14010,8441,Adaptive robust control of variable displacement pumps,2013,"In this paper, supply pressure control of variable displacement axial piston pumps which are subjected to large extent of nonlinearities and model uncertainties are investigated. A detailed nonlinear swashplate torque model which provides more insights is derived from general hydraulic and mechanical considerations and is used for controller design. Aside from the nonlinear swashplate torque model, this system also has large extent of model uncertainties which makes the control design a challenging task. To prevent the negative influence introduced by parameter variations and uncertain nonlinearities, adaptive robust control (ARC) is applied to synthesize a controller. This controller is able to take into account the effect of parameter uncertainty and uncertain nonlinearities while guarantee a prescribed transient performance and final tracking accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed controller has a satisfying robust behavior."
2122292,14010,8441,Control reconfigurability-based placement strategy for FACTS devices,2013,"This paper considers the placement of Flexible AC transmission system devices into power systems with a criterion of maintaining a prescribed level of control reconfigurability. Control reconfigurability in this paper measures the small signal combined controllability and observability of a power system with an additional requirement on tolerance to loss of measurement data in any single measurement unit in the system, which have not been considered in the existing works. Control device placement is formulated as an optimization problem of finding a minimum number of new control devices to meet a prescribed control reconfigurability threshold. A binary search algorithm and a genetic algorithm are applied to Thyristor Controlled Series Compensators into a number of IEEE test systems. More specifically, Placement results for 14, 30, 57 and 118-bus IEEE test systems are presented."
2537473,14010,8441,The parameterization of all robust stabilizing simple multi-period repetitive controllers for multiple-input/multiple-output plants with specified input-output frequency characteristic,2013,"In this paper, we propose the parameterization of all robust stabilizing simple multi-period repetitive controllers for multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) plants with specified input-output frequency characteristic. Recently, Sakanushi et al. proposed the parameterization of all robust stabilizing simple multi-period repetitive controllers such that the controller works as a robust stabilizing multi-period repetitive controller and transfer functions from the periodic reference input to the output and from the disturbance to the output have finite numbers of poles. However, using their method, it is complex to specify the low-pass filters in the internal model for the periodic reference input that specifies the input-output frequency characteristic, because the low-pass filters are related to more than three free parameters. Our proposed parameterization in this paper overcomes this problem by specifying the low-pass filters beforehand. That is, using our parameterization, we can design a control system which has desirable input-output frequency characteristic more easily than the method proposed by Sakanushi et al."
2394854,14010,8441,Model reduction and nonlinear MPC for energy management in buildings,2013,"In this paper, we introduce a singular perturbations framework for the dynamic analysis and model reduction of building models. Working with a prototype building, we present a theoretical justification of the empirically acknowledged multiple time scale dynamic response of buildings, and develop a mathematically rigorous methodology for deriving reduced-order models for the dynamics in each time scale. Our analysis accounts for the potential use of Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), and we show that their presence leads to the emergence of a dynamic behavior with three time scales, including an overall, system-wide component which involves both the building and the HVAC system. The second part of the paper presents a simulation case study, where we demonstrate the use of the derived reduced-order models in the synthesis of a nonlinear predictive model-based optimal energy management strategy for a single-zone test building situated on the University of Texas campus. The proposed controller exhibits excellent performance, can easily be executed in real-time and its application results in significant energy savings compared to setpoint tracking strategies."
2137968,14010,8441,Obstacle avoidance for an extremum seeking system using a navigation function,2013,"The problem of autonomously steering a vehicle to a destination point, while avoiding obstacles, is considered. The vehicle is modeled as a single-integrator in the plane and it is assumed that the obstacles are unknown a priori. The control law is an extremum seeking algorithm, which steers the vehicle to the minimum of a navigation function. In this framework, obstacle avoidance and practical uniform convergence to a destination point for almost all initial conditions is proven. The theoretic results are illustrated using numerical examples."
1797830,14010,8441,Stable nonlinear identification from noisy repeated experiments via convex optimization,2013,"This paper introduces new techniques for using convex optimization to fit input-output data to a class of stable nonlinear dynamical models. We present an algorithm that guarantees consistent estimates of models in this class when a small set of repeated experiments with suitably independent measurement noise is available. Stability of the estimated models is guaranteed without any assumptions on the input-output data. We first present a convex optimization scheme for identifying stable state-space models from empirical moments. Next, we provide a method for using repeated experiments to remove the effect of noise on these moment and model estimates. The technique is demonstrated on a simple simulated example."
1691145,14010,8441,Control over direct and feedback path signal-to-noise ratio constrained channels,2013,"In this paper we address the problem of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constrained channels simultaneously located over the direct path (between the controller and the plant) and the feedback path (between the plant and the controller) within a feedback control configuration. We first study the presence of memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. For this channel model we consider the suboptimal approaches that give priority to one channel over the other, and then compare them with the approach that simultaneously minimize the SNR of both channels. We also discuss the case in which the additive noise process is the same for both channels. We then extend the results to the additive colored Gaussian noise (AGCN) channel model."
1757069,14010,8441,Multi-agent consensus algorithm with obstacle avoidance via optimal control approach,2011,"Multi-agent consensus problem in an obstacle-laden environment is addressed in this paper. A novel optimal control approach is proposed for the multi-agent system to reach consensus as well as avoid obstacles with a reasonable control effort. An innovative nonquadratic penalty function is constructed to achieve obstacle avoidance capability from an inverse optimal control perspective. The asymptotic stability and optimality of the consensus algorithm are proven. In addition, the optimal control law of each agent only requires local information from the neighbors to guarantee the proposed behaviors, rather than all agents' information. The consensus and obstacle avoidance are validated through various simulations."
2163512,14010,8441,Direct data-driven design of sparse controllers,2013,This paper deals with direct data-driven design of model-reference controllers whose number of parameters is constrained. Input-output (I/O) sparse controllers are introduced and proposed as an alternative to low-order controller tuning. The optimal I/O sparse controller is shown to be never worse than the optimal low-order controller with the same number of parameters and a suited design procedure based on convex optimization is derived. The theoretical concepts are illustrated by means of a benchmark simulation example.
1755941,14010,8441,Direct adaptive multiple-model control schemes,2013,"In this paper a direct model reference adaptive control based multiple-model control framework is developed. Such multiple-model control scheme is designed for single-input single-output (SISO) systems, and its basic design procedure and new features are demonstrated. Such a scheme is then developed for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, showing its key advantage of capable of ensuring the nonsingularity of a gain matrix estimate, crucial for multivariable adaptive control, over other indirect adaptive multiple-model control designs. In these schemes, a bank of adaptive controllers initialized from different parameter subregions are constructed whose parameters are directly updated, not indirectly calculated from plant or certain reparametrized system parameter estimates. A control switching mechanism is designed with performance indices based on tracking error related estimation errors. An input filtering method for smooth control is proposed for those applications whose input signals need to be continuous. Simulation results for a SISO system are presented to show the improved system transient responses."
2336977,14010,8441,"An innovative method for optimization based, high order controller auto-tuning",2013,"A new automatic method to tune the parameters of high order linear controllers is presented. The auto-tuning is achieved by minimizing, without constraints, a cost function that is related to the open loop shaping problem. The effort demanded from the designer is similar to that required to tune a low order controller such as PI or PID. The capabilities of the new method are demonstrated on two examples."
2108957,14010,8441,Stabilizability of LTI MIMO systems with uncertain parameters under communication constraints,2013,"In this paper, we deal with stabilizability problems of linear discrete time-invariant MIMO systems with unknown plants under communication constraints between plants and controllers. The plants are assumed to include uncertainties not only in the initial state vector but also in system parameters. We show that the tight lower bound of the necessary capacity of the communication channel for the stabilizability is given only by unstable poles of the plants. We also introduce a set of a coder, a decoder, and a controller which is allowed to exchange information not only on the uncertain state vector but also on the uncertain system parameters and satisfies the stability of the closed loop systems when the condition is satisfied."
1938722,14010,8441,Stochastic optimal control for series hybrid electric vehicles,2013,"Increasing demand for improving fuel economy and reducing emissions has stimulated significant research and investment in hybrid propulsion systems. In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing online the supervisory control in a series hybrid configuration by modeling its operation as a controlled Markov chain using the average cost criterion. We treat the stochastic optimal control problem as a dual constrained optimization problem. We show that the control policy that yields higher probability distribution to the states with low cost and lower probability distribution to the states with high cost is an optimal control policy, defined as an equilibrium control policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the efficiency of the proposed controller in a series hybrid configuration and compare it with a thermostat-type controller."

2213857,14010,11104,Geosemantically-enhanced PubMed queries using the GeoNames ontology and Web Services,2012,"PubMed is a popular biomedical bibliographic database curated by the US National Library of Medicine. Limitations may be encountered when querying PubMed for studies from or about a particular geographic location. For example, if a citation record does not include the word ‘Canada’ but instead includes ‘Ontario’ as the named place in its text, a PubMed query to find all studies conducted in Canada using only the keyword ‘Canada’ will not be able to retrieve that particular record. We propose that a GeoNames-powered PubMed search has the potential of solving such issues. By bringing in the “intelligence” of a geographic ontology and the ability to reason with place names (e.g., recognise ‘Ontario’ as a province of ‘Canada’), a search engine can infer implicit meanings in the queried records that are not directly mentioned as free text or as keyword terms in either the citation records or their metadata."

2360038,14010,8441,Rebalancing the rebalancers: optimally routing vehicles and drivers in mobility-on-demand systems,2013,"In this paper we study rebalancing strategies for a mobility-on-demand urban transportation system blending customer-driven vehicles with a taxi service. In our system, a customer arrives at one of many designated stations and is transported to any other designated station, either by driving themselves, or by being driven by an employed driver. When some origins and destinations are more popular than others, vehicles will become unbalanced, accumulating at some stations and becoming depleted at others. This problem is addressed by employing rebalancing drivers to drive vehicles from the popular destinations to the unpopular destinations. However, with this approach the rebalancing drivers themselves become unbalanced, and we need to “rebalance the rebalancers” by letting them travel back to the popular destinations with a customer. In this paper we study how to optimally route the rebalancing vehicles and drivers so that the number of waiting customers remains bounded while minimizing the number of rebalancing vehicles traveling in the network and the number of rebalancing drivers needed; surprisingly, these two objectives are aligned, and one can find the optimal rebalancing strategy by solving two decoupled linear programs. We determine the minimum number of drivers and minimum number of vehicles needed to ensure stability in the system. Our simulations suggest that, in Euclidean network topologies, one would need between 1/3 and 1/4 as many drivers as vehicles."

The general gearshift of a DCT is divided into several stages for better dynamic derivation and controller design. Based on detailed dynamic modeling, the Model Reference Control (MRC) method is proposed and integrated into the traditional control logic together with PID control configuration so as to observe the best gearshift quality. Numeric simulations and parallel parameter optimization is proceeded on Matlab platform. The results demonstrate that the MRC method applied on DCT clutch control can evidently reduce both the jerk shock and frictional loss of dual-clutch operations, which proves MRC method as a wise choice of DCT controlling strategy. Meanwhile, several theoretical predictions have been verified by the simulation curves to show the effectiveness of MRC again."
1128466,14010,208,Cooperative n-boundary tracking in large scale environments,2012,"Monitoring in large scale environments is a typical mission in cooperative robotics. This task requires the exploration of a huge domain by a generally small number of sensor equipped mobile robots. As time restrictions prohibit an exhaustive global search, a sampling strategy is required that allows an efficient spatial mapping of the environment. This paper proposes an adaptive sampling strategy for efficient simultaneous tracking of multiple concentration levels of an atmospheric plume by a team of cooperating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The approach combines uncertainty and correlation-based concentration estimates to generate sampling points based on already gathered data. The adaptive generation of sampling locations is coupled to a distributed modelpredictive controller for planning optimal vehicle trajectories under collision and communication constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that connectivity of all involved vehicles can be maintained and an accurate reconstruction of the plume is obtained efficiently."
1448992,14010,8228,3D compressive sensing for nodes localization in WNs based on RSS,2012,"Compressive sensing (CS) intends to recover signals at a sampling rate significantly (much) lower than that classically used according to the Nyquist theorem. This allows avoiding unnecessary sampling and complexity. In this paper, a Three-Dimensional Compressive Sensing (3D-CS) approach is proposed for nodes localization in wireless networks. In 3D-CS-R2S2 approach, which is based on the ratio of received signal strength (RSS), a 3D sparsity basis and a 3D measurement matrix are used as radio map and noisy measurements respectively in order to recover the target position. A specific multi-linear algebra procedure was developed using N-way array products, together with an adequate decomposition. Both allow formulating the localization problem in a way that is solvable by an l 1 -minimization algorithm based on CS theory. 3D-CS-R2S2 improves localization accuracy even if propagation conditions change significantly and/or the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) is unknown. Additionally, it enables practical Real Time Localization Systems (RTLS) development since 3D-CS-R2S2 can be functional with a reduced number of base stations without compromising position recovery accuracy. The simulation results show the efficiency of the method that not only succeeds to recover a target position but also improves localization accuracy in presence of noise."
2394875,14010,8441,"Fuel economy comparisons of series, parallel and HMT hydraulic hybrid architectures",2013,"Since hydraulic hybrid vehicles are power dense and do not require costly batteries, they have the potential to achieve high fuel economy and performance and at low cost. The three main classes of hydraulic hybrid architectures are series, parallel and hydro-mechanical (HMT) or power-split. These architectures have intrinsic differences in transmission efficiencies and effectiveness in engine management. This paper compares the fuel economies and performance of these architectures and validates these features. Using a Toyota Prius like engine and chassis as common factors, fuel economies are compared for the “optimal” design for each architecture which considers both the physical designs and the engine/energy management. Physical design variables include pump/motor sizes and gear ratios. The effect of pump/motors efficiencies, extra gears and different engine efficiency maps are also studied. To improve computational efficiency in evaluating fuel economy, engine operation is restricted to several operating modes and the accumulator pressure is assumed to be constant. These simplifications enable the Lagrange multiplier method to be employed so as to quickly determine the optimal engine management control and the resulting fuel economy for each design iteration. Full optimal control computations without the simplifying assumptions for the optimized design for each architecture (using dynamic programming) verify that, despite these simplification, the estimated fuel economies are close. It is shown that hybrid HMT offers the best fuel economy for various hydraulic efficiencies, followed by parallel and series architectures. However, the difference between HMT and parallel architectures diminishes if the engine has a wide efficient speed range of operation.

Three decision structures are derived using the confusion matrix of a single classifier and a priori information, and the performances of the different decision structures are compared. First, we consider the performance of a team of three classifiers with a total of 256 fusion rules. Then, we propose a decision structure that utilizes a moderator, i.e., an entity that exploits Bayesian inference from individual classifiers' decisions and makes final decisions based on maximum likelihood classification. We show the benefits of using a moderator (compared to a decision structure without a moderator). Finally, we propose a decision structure that exploits pairing, i.e., fusing the classifiers' decisions sequentially two-by-two. Two pairing schemes, i.e., incremental and tournament-like, are proposed and we show that incremental pairing is the most effective decision structure among the proposed ones."
2333084,14010,8441,Ideal Free Distributions in human decision-making,2013,"Integrating human factors into the design of large-scale distributed applications requires capturing broad patterns of decision-making over time. The proposed theoretical framework introduces a dynamic model that resembles empirical dispersal patterns between the quality of an option and the number of individuals choosing that option. We use the notion of the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) to estimate the resulting population-dependent equilibrium point and reduce uncertainty about how groups of individuals choose between available options. Our contribution is twofold. First, we identify conditions that lead to the IFD under constrained choice. Second, we illustrate how biases in decision-making can lead to systemic deviations from the IFD."
2528589,14010,8441,Parsimonious deadlock-free Petri net models of flexible manufacturing systems,2013,"Petri net (PN) modeling of flexible manufacturing systems is generally performed through a sequential procedure that introduces additional constraint layers over an unconstrained PN modeling the production sequences. The constraints account for job limitations, resources usage, liveness, etc., and are typically all representable as generalized mutual exclusion constraints, that can be implemented as monitor places suitably connected to the PN's transitions. This sequential procedure typically yields a redundant model, that is not easily reduced a posteriori. An integrated modeling approach is here proposed to solve the redundancy problem by enforcing all the constraints in a single design step that optimizes the number of monitors. The monitor design task is reformulated as a classification problem, which is solved through an efficient branch & bound approach. Some examples emphasize the potential model size reductions that can be achieved."
1675584,14010,8441,Process model parameterisation in posegraphs,2013,"Through propagating information over time, process models serve a vital in any multi-time step estimation algorithm. However, they can introduce nonlinearities which can significantly degrade the performance of an estimator. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the parameterisation of the process model in posegraph-based formulations of filtering and estimation algorithms. Exploiting the flexibility and conditional independence structure of a posegraph, we develop two formulations of a process noise model of a vehicle - one in Euclidean space, the other in polar space. Using moment-matching, we develop exact closed form solutions for the first two moments of a Gaussian distribution propagated through both models. We analyse the effects of both formulations in the context of a Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) problem. We show that, by representing the “arc-like” nature of the prediction error more accurately, the polar form is more accurate, more robust, and is less computationally expensive than the Euclidean form."
2386511,14010,8441,Visual stimulus design in parameter estimation of the human smooth pursuit system from eye-tracking data,2013,"The dynamical properties of the human smooth pursuit system (SPS) are studied. Linear black-box and nonlinear Wiener models of the SPS are identified from eye-tracking data in view of their potential applications in diagnosing and staging various clinical conditions. A novel approach to visual stimuli design is suggested and evaluated. Accurate estimation of the linear dynamics requires sufficient input frequency excitation, while the identification of the nonlinear part is dependent upon the signal amplitude distribution. Both aspects of input design are taken into account. Visual stimuli generated using the presented method are shown to yield favorable identification results compared to existing stimuli design techniques in terms of reduced variance of parameter estimates and smaller spread of the parameter clouds pertaining to different individuals. The nonlinear Wiener models of the SPS appear to outperform the linear ones provided the visual stimuli are properly designed."
2076064,14010,8441,Wave disturbance reduction of a floating wind turbine using a reference model-based predictive control,2013,"Floating wind turbines are considered as a new and promising solution for reaching higher wind resources beyond the water depth restriction of monopile wind turbines. But on a floating structure, the wave-induced loads significantly increase the oscillations of the structure. Furthermore, using a controller designed for an onshore wind turbine yields instability in the fore-aft rotation. In this paper, we propose a general framework, where a reference model models the desired closed-loop behavior of the system. Model predictive control combined with a state estimator finds the optimal rotor blade pitch such that the state trajectories of the controlled system tracks the reference trajectories. The framework is demonstrated with a reference model of the desired closed-loop system undisturbed by the incident waves. This allows the wave-induced motion of the platform to be damped significantly compared to a baseline floating wind turbine controller at the cost of more pitch action."
2447409,14010,8441,A real-time projection-based approach for fault accommodation in NREL's 5MW Wind Turbine systems,2013,"This paper presents a real-time mechanism to tolerate faults occurring in a Wind Turbine system such that it can generate the rated power at anytime. This mechanism lies under the taxonomy of Active Fault-Tolerant Control (AFTC) system, namely projection-based approach. In the proposed approach, we do not use any a priori information about the model of the plant in real-time. In fact, we use the online measurements generated by the plant. Based on the given control objectives, and the observed measurements, the controller is re-configured such that the turbine can generate the rated power even under faulty conditions. Secondly, no use of an explicit fault-diagnosis module is seen in this approach. The benchmark model for the Wind Turbine is a FAST coded simulator designed by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) National Wind Turbine Center."
2155283,14010,8441,Coordinated-distributed MPC of nonlinear systems based on price-driven coordination,2013,"The main objective of this work is to design a coordinated distributed model predictive control (CDMPC) architecture for nonlinear systems using the price-driven coordination method. One fundamental assumption of this work is that a centralized model predictive control (MPC) scheme can be designed based on successive linearization of the nonlinear system that is able to asymptotically stabilize the closed-loop system at the origin and the coordination schemes strives to get to the very same performance via adding a coordinator level to the existing decentralized structure. In other words, the coordinator and the distributed MPCs exchange information and calculate the optimal future input trajectories iteratively. In order to deploy the price-driven coordination algorithm developed by Marcos [1], which is applicable to linear or linearized systems, the alkylation process of benzene used as a case study was successively linearized around the operating points. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can be successfully applied to nonlinear systems using a successive linearization strategy."

771783,14010,20896,A cryptographic scheme for real-world wireless sensor networks applications,2013,"This demo deals with the cryptographic aspect of security applied to the WSN domain. In particular, it shows in action a novel cryptographic scheme compliant to security requirements of real-world WSN applications (i.e. with very limited system resources). The proposed scheme exploits benefits from both symmetric and asymmetric ones where the keys, for each communicating node pairs, can be generated only if such nodes have been authenticated with respect to the network topology. As a main difference with respect to existing approaches, the proposed scheme doesn't rely on the pre-distribution of keys but it is based on their dynamic generation exploiting partial information stored on nodes. Then, through computationally inexpensive operations, a node can compute the decrypt/encrypt key in a single phase with no steps of setup/negotiation. Furthermore, the proposed approach allows to authenticate a message with respect to a set of planned network topologies. For this, it has been called TAK2 ( Topology Authenticated Key 2 , i.e. an improvement of [1]). TAK2 has been implemented in  nesC/TinyOS_1.x  [2]. In particular, TAK2 has been integrated in the SW component provided by TinyOS_1.x to manage basic communications (i.e.  GenericComm ) while keeping its original interface to be completely transparent to the upper layers. In fact,  GenericComm  is the TinyOS_1.x component that allows the exchange of messages with the physical layer through the  SendMsg  and  ReceiveMsg  interfaces. Then, it has been replaced by the so called  SecureComm  component: it provides the same interfaces of  GenericComm  so that it is able to intercept the exchange of original messages while introducing described security mechanisms. So, a SW component that needs to send a radio messages will use the  send()  command of  SecureComm  instead of the  GenericComm  one. The new implementation delegates the elaborations to a  send_message()  task. This task generates a random number, performs topology authentication and computes the key by knowing the address of destination node. Then, it encrypts the plain text and produce the packet to be sent on air by means of the original  GenericComm send()  command. Received messages are managed in a similar way: a new event handler is wired to the  receive()  handler of  GenericComm  to delegate some processing to a  receive_message()  task. Such a task performs topology authentication computing also the key used to decipher the message. It is worth noting that the task is able to authenticate the message accepting or discarding it. When a valid message is identified, it is delivered as it was processed by the original  GenericComm receive()  handler.   The proposed demo is based on a classic TinyOS_1.x WSN monitoring application (e.g.  Oscilloscope  [2] or similar) that will be run by means of some  Memsic MicaZ  nodes with basic light and temperature sensors. Two different application configurations will be running at the same time, with and without the proposed security mechanism, while proper sniffers will monitor the data flow in the different situations to show the different applications behavior. In particular, the demo aims to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and its computational efficiency. For the former, the demo will show how the schema is able to satisfy security requirements of  Confidentiality ,  Integrity  and  Authentication . For the latter, the demo will show off-line and run-time metrics evaluating the overhead of the proposed approach."

Customized HFCs are designed for critical steps in parking, namely turning control and posture stabilization.

2112424,14010,8441,Further results on the observability in magneto-inertial navigation,2013,"This paper shows that one can relax an important assumption usually formulated to employ the magneto-inertial navigation (MINAV) technique. This technique, which allows to reconstruct the velocity of a rigid body moving in a magnetically disturbed area, usually assumes that the (unknown) Jacobian of the magnetic field is everywhere non-singular. As it is here demonstrated, this assumption can be significantly alleviated thanks to further investigations on the observability of the dynamics at stake. Corresponding relaxed assumptions require rotations to sufficiently come into play during the motion one wishes to estimate the velocity of. This result opens new perspectives on the range of applicability of the MINAV technique."
1634845,14010,8441,ULTRA - Unmanned Low-cost Testing Research Aircraft,2013,"Flight testing on manned aircraft is expensive, since it requires, among others, certified aircraft, professional staff, and plenty of time and effort for preparation and postprocessing.

2572009,14010,11104,Dual-wavelength High-Spectral-Resolution Lidar for advanced classification and retrieval of aerosols,2011,"A two-wavelength High-Spectral-Resolution Lidar (HSRL) system is developed. This lidar system provides 2α+3β+2δ data: extinction coefficients (α) at 355 and 532 nm, backscatter coefficients (β) at 355, 532, and 1064 nm, and depolarization ratios (δ) at 532 and 1064 nm. This system combines use of the previously developed HSRL techniques with an iodine absorption filter for 532nm and a Fabry-Perot etalon for 355nm. To realize temporally continuous measurements, we also develop a system to tune the laser wavelength to an iodine absorption line and then automatically tune the Fabry-Perot etalon to the third harmonic of the laser. We conducted preliminary measurements using the constructed systems. The temporal and vertical variation of aerosols could be determined. The constructed 532nm HSRL system could measure molecule Rayleigh backscatter signals by blocking aerosol Mie backscatter signals with the iodine absorption filter, indicating that the developed laser wavelength tuning system worked well."
1666587,14010,8228,Avoiding overages by deferred aggregate demand for PEV charging on the smart grid,2012,"We model the aggregate overnight demand for electricity by a large community of (possibly hybrid) plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) each of whose power demand follows a prescribed profile and is interruptible. The community is served by a regional electrical utility which is assumed to purchase electricity from a state/national distribution grid according to a flat-rate Φ per kilowatt-unit-time up to a threshold L, and thereafter overage (demand > L) charges π > Φ are leveed per kilowatt-unit-time. Rather than a spot-price system for household consumers (which would necessarily need to be operated by automated means overnight when most consumers sleep), the “grid” (regional utility) is “smart” in that it monitors its total load and, when overages threaten, can reduce load by signaling certain consumers to interrupt charging and defer their charging load by one unit of time. In this paper, we model the uninterrupted load by a Gaussian process which we justify by means of a functional central limit theorem (FCLT). This limiting Gaussian process is the arrival process of a discrete-time queue which is used to model the (partially) interrupted and deferred load over a finite time-horizon. We can then compute the mean amount of overage at the end of this time horizon (say at 6 AM when charging is to be completed ahead of the morning commute)."
766067,14010,20896,Rationale and Architecture Principles for Medical Application Platforms,2012,"The concept of system of systems architecture is increasingly prevalent in many critical domains. Such systems allow information to be pulled from a variety of sources, analyzed to discover correlations and trends, stored to enable real-time and post-hoc assessment, mined to better inform decision-making, and leveraged to automate control of system units. In contrast, medical devices typically have been developed as monolithic stand-alone units. However, a vision is emerging of a notion of a medical application platform (MAP) that would provide device and health information systems (HIS) interoperability, safety critical network middleware, and an execution environment for clinical applications (apps) that offer numerous advantages for safety and effectiveness in health care delivery. In this paper, we present the clinical safety/effectiveness and economic motivations for MAPs, and describe key characteristics of MAPs that are guiding the search for appropriate technology, regulatory, and ecosystem solutions. We give an overview of the Integrated Clinical Environment (ICE) - one particular achitecture for MAPs, and the Medical Device Coordination Framework - a prototype implementation of the ICE architecture."

2167684,14010,8441,Reduced-order modeling of thermally induced deformations on reticles for extreme ultraviolet lithography,2013,"Ranking already among the dominant causes of imaging errors in photolithography, deformation of reticles due to inevitable heating is becoming progressively more crucial in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography as the source power continually increases, leading to higher levels of absorption of the EUV light by reticles. In order to mitigate its impact on exposed layers, accurate predictions to be the inputs of a control scheme are essential. To serve this purpose, a large-scale thermo-mechanical model in partially linear state-space form is derived by using the finite element method (FEM). The temperature-dependent coefficient of thermal expansion of materials produces the only nonlinearity in the model that is present in the static output equations. Since only low-order models are feasible for real-time use, this model is undergone several model reduction techniques to arrive at the best compact model with respect to its prediction performance, compaction rate, and easiness of computation. Treating the simulation outputs from a FEM software as the benchmark, the proper orthogonal decomposition approach combined with the discrete empirical interpolation method is selected as the most suitable route for the studied application."
1983818,14010,8441,SLUGS UAV: A flexible and versatile hardware/software platform for guidance navigation and control research,2013,"This paper presents the Santa Cruz Low-Cost UAV GNC Subsystem (SLUGS) developed at the University of California Santa Cruz. It is a versatile and flexible autopilot capable of controlling a small unmanned system. It is tightly integrated with MATLAB/Simulink, and allows for a simple and easy transition from pure simulation to HIL simulation to flight code. The hardware's main processing units are two low-cost dsPIC33F DSCs, one handling sensor input and the other managing the navigation and control loops. The sensor DSC implements a complementary attitude and position filter. An interprocessor communication protocol delivers fused attitude and position estimates to the control DSC. The control DSC implements low-level platform stabilization using PID loops, and higher level waypoint following based on a line-of-sight guidance law. Data is logged and available for replay post flight on both the ground station software, and also within MATLAB/Simulink. The hardware was installed on a low-cost single engine electric RC aircraft, and has been demonstrated to be capable of sustained autonomous flight. Several estimation topologies have been tested and developed using the system. The SLUGS is general, and can be adapted to multiple autonomous platforms such as helicopters, quadrotors, twin engine aircraft, ground, and marine surface vehicles."
1769359,14010,8441,Online estimation of time-varying torque characteristics of automotive clutches using a control oriented model,2013,"Many concepts for controlling automated clutches use the clutch characteristic as the quasi-steady-state model of torque transmission. In this case, the accuracy of the clutch characteristic used has a significant influence on the quality of control that can be achieved and consequently affects criteria as important as comfort, shifting time or component strain during operation. As a result, it is often necessary to identify changes in transmission behavior of the clutch at the earliest possible stage and adjust the clutch characteristic accordingly. Taking a physics-based approach, this paper focuses on modeling clutch characteristics with the intention of using the model within existing control structures. It also presents a method that is used online for identifying constant or time-varying parameters of the characteristic model developed."

1500075,14010,208,Context-Aware Handoff on Smartphones,2013,"Nowadays smartphone users often enjoy the availability of multi-networks by switching between the networks for better network performance, energy efficiency of smartphones, and more data offloading to less expensive networks. However, network switching inevitably brings about network disruptions leading to user experience degradation. In this paper, we propose an application context model that is used in conjunction with a heuristic network selection mechanism, which selects a network using three metrics (i.e., network performance, energy consumption, and cost). A Bayes classifier is used to provide a probability for the network selection given applications running during network disruptions. We construct the classifier via crowd-sourced data by considering smartphone users profile and the operating environments. We implement a prototype context-aware handoff on the Android platform and conducted an experiment in a real world scenario through one case study, switching between cellular and WiFi networks. The evaluation results suggest that context aware handoff achieves 25% energy cost, nearly one-third data offloading, and more than twice throughput with only one third of the network switchings."
2125002,14010,8441,Mining PMU data for real-time insights into grid power flow properties,2013,"Summary form only given. A synchronous power grid in steady state operation is a power flow solution engine: its inputs are the demanded and injected powers at load and generation buses, its outputs the sinusoidal (quasi-) steady state behavior of voltages at all buses in the network. With wide-spread deployment of phasor measurement units, grid operators are able to monitor the time varying, windowed Fourier component of these voltages about the 50 or 60 Hz fundamental. In traditional power flow studies, these voltage phasors would be estimated by solving the power flow equations, given power demands and injections. The premise of this work is that phasor measurements will allow real-time, “model free” monitoring of the properties of the power flow. On an fast time scale, load variation includes a broad-bandwidth stochastic component that excites the system over a wide range of input directions. In this framework, a widowed array of output vectors (i.e., the phasor measurements) carries information regarding the conditioning of the powerflow. The work here develops a “model free” computation of the largest singular value of a PMU measurement array, and shows it closely tracks the largest singular value of the power flow Jacobian inverse, as computed with full system model information."
1599693,14010,8441,A method for automatically scheduling notified deferrable loads,2013,"In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for the automatic scheduling of deferrable loads in a notified system. Load profiles are deferred in a `greedy' manner in order to reduce the sum of squared errors between the aggregate scheduled load and a specified target load profile. Numerical results using data from the Plugwise dataset are shown and we also describe how the algorithm helps in peak reduction, and how this delay corresponds to energy storage. As this load scheduling system is designed to follow a target curve, another use of this algorithm is to provide energy market participants with a means of bidding into capacity markets the difference between the original aggregate load and the scheduled aggregate load."
1878872,14010,8441,Enabling large load transitions on multicylinder recompression HCCI engines using fuel governors,2013,"The fuel governor control design methodology presented in [1] is extended and experimentally validated on a multicylinder recompression homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine. This strategy regulates desired combustion phasing during load transitions across the HCCI load range. A baseline controller tracks combustion phasing by manipulating valve and fuel injection timings. A reference governor is then added on to the compensated system to modify the fuel injection amount by enforcing actuator constraints. Experimental results show improved transient responses of combustion phasing and load during load transitions, when the possibility of constraint violations exists. The nonlinear fuel governor predicts future model trajectories in real-time, and enables larger load transitions than were possible with the baseline controller alone. The complexity and computational overhead of this strategy are reduced by developing a linearized fuel governor, which is shown to work well in the entire HCCI load range and for small variations in engine speed."
1759159,14010,8441,Supervision localization of timed discrete-event systems,2013,"We study supervisor localization for real-time discrete-event systems (DES) in the Brandin-Wonham timed supervisory control framework. We view a real-time DES as comprised of asynchronous agents which are coupled through imposed logical and temporal specifications; the essence of supervisor localization is the decomposition of monolithic (global) control action into local control strategies for the individual agents. This study extends our previous work on supervisor localization for untimed DES, in that monolithic timed control action typically includes not only disabling action as in the untimed case, but also “clock preempting” action which enforces prescribed temporal behavior. The latter action is executed by a class of special events, called “forcible” events; and accordingly, we localize monolithic preemptive action with respect to these events. We demonstrate the new features of timed supervisor localization on a manufacturing cell case study, and discuss a distributed control implementation."
1542511,14010,8441,Controlling combustion phasing variability with fuel injection timing in a multicylinder HCCI engine,2013,"Reduction of combustion phasing cyclic variability (CV) in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines operating lean with late autoignition is experimentally demonstrated. A three-state discrete time model developed in [1] is used for controlling the fuel injection timing and is applied to a multicylinder engine. A key objective of this work is to reduce cyclic variability without advancing the mean combustion phasing. Specifically, if late combustion phasing can be made less variable without advancing the operating point then areas where high CV is typically encountered could be made less variable. Examples include load transition down, when the residual temperature drops more rapidly than can be manipulated by the valve timing, or during mode transitions. Experimental results are presented to gauge the effectiveness of two control schemes, namely proportional and state feedback which have been tuned using the three-state model. Each of these controllers have been augmented with an integrator to maintain the late combustion phasing requirement. This is also done to draw a fair comparison of the controllers ability to reduce CV. The controllers are tested at various levels of CV and it is found that simple control can reduce the standard deviation of combustion phasing an average of 17% over open loop behavior. In addition, because of the simplicity of the control, this offers a viable solution for commercial applications."

1713025,14010,8441,A spectral model for evaluating the effect of wind evolution on wind turbine preview control,2013,"As wind turbines become larger and more flexible, the potential benefits of load mitigating control systems become more important to reduce fatigue and extend component life. In the last five years, there has been significant research activity exploring the effectiveness of preview control techniques that may be feasible using advanced wind measurement technologies like LIDAR (light detection and ranging). However, most control development tools use Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. The end result is that preview measurements made up-stream from the rotor can be obtained with unrealistic accuracy, because the same wind velocities eventually arrive at the turbine. In this study, we extend the spectral methods commonly used to generate turbulent wind fields for controls simulation, but in a way that emulates wind evolution. This changes preview measurements made upwind from the rotor, in such a way that the differences- between the preview measurements and speeds arriving at the turbine- increase with distance from the rotor. We then evaluate the degradation in load mitigation performance of a controller that uses preview measurements obtained at various distances in front of the rotor."
1667274,14010,8441,Dynamic optimization of a solar thermal energy storage system over a 24 hour period using weather forecasts,2013,"A solar thermal power plant is used as a case study for dynamic heat integration with thermal energy storage. Findings show that thermal energy storage gives the system the ability to make the power dispatchable. Additionally, by solving a 24-hour dynamic optimization problem where the plant temperatures and power output are variable allows the system to capture and harvest a higher percentage of solar energy, with the most benefit occurring on mostly cloudy days. The solar energy captured increases 64% from 4.75 MWh to 7.80 MWh using this scheme. Hybrid plant operation and the ability to bypass the storage tanks further improve the system performance."
2313452,14010,8441,Novel non-intrusive sensor for piston position measurement,2013,"This paper proposes a novel sensor for the non-intrusive real-time measurement of piston position inside a cylinder. The proposed sensor exploits the principle that any ferromagnetic object has an inherent magnetic field which varies as a function of position around the object. By modeling the magnetic field as a function of position and using sensors to measure magnetic field intensity, the position of the object can be estimated. This principle is used to measure piston position in a free piston engine without requiring any sensors inside the engine cylinder. The piston is approximated as a rectangular metallic object and the variation of the magnetic field around it is modeled. A challenge arises from the fact that the parameters of the model would vary from engine to engine and would be cumber-some to calibrate for each engine. This challenge is addressed by utilizing two magnetic field sensors with known longitudinal separation between them. An iterated least squares algorithm then provides adaptive parameter estimates and accurate position estimation. Experimental results from a free piston engine set up show that the proposed sensor can provide better than 0.4 mm accuracy in position estimates. The proposed sensing concept can be utilized for piston position measurement in multi-cylinder SI and diesel engines, hydraulic cylinders and in many other position measurement applications."

2254495,14010,8441,Time-optimal vehicle posture control to mitigate unavoidable collisions using conventional control inputs,2013,"This paper analyzes the mitigation of an unavoidable T-bone collision, where an “intelligent” vehicle executes an aggressive time-optimal rotation to achieve a favorable relative orientation with another vehicle prior to impact. The current paper extends the previous work by the authors on this problem, by modeling additional vehicle dynamics (neglected in the prior work) and by utilizing conventionally available control commands (that is, steering, braking, handbrake) for the maneuvering vehicle. The commands can either be applied directly by a trained driver, or (as in the majority of cases) can be executed with the help of a combination of an Active Front Steering (AFS) and an Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system onboard the vehicle. The optimal yaw rotation maneuver is analyzed for different initial speeds on both dry and wet asphalt. The results confirm the existence of an “option zone” for some cases, within which such an aggressive maneuver may be possible and perhaps even preferable to straight line braking."
1500920,14010,8441,A smooth hybrid symbolic control for the formation of UAVs over a partitioned space,2013,"This paper presents and implements a smooth hybrid supervisory control mechanism for the formation of unmanned helicopters. A polar partitioning scheme is utilized to bisimilarly abstract the motion space to find a finite state model for the motion dynamics of UAVs. To implement this algorithm, a hierarchical control structure is introduced which uses a discrete supervisor on the top layer that is connected to the regulation layer via an interface layer. The implantation issues of the proposed algorithm are investigated and a control mechanism is introduced to smoothly transit over the partitioned space without any jump on the control signals while preserving the bisimulation relation between the abstract model and the original continuous system. Actual flight test results are presented to verify the algorithm and the control structure performance."
2182568,14010,8441,Nonlinear model predictive control of IGCC plants with membrane reactors for carbon capture,2013,"This paper focuses on the application of a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) method to coal-based integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants with water gas shift membrane reactors (WGS-MR) for pre-combustion capture of CO 2 . A systems-level nonlinear model of the integrated IGCC-MR process is introduced. The simulation results for a steady-state design used as a starting point for the control studies are presented. For such studies, a centralized nonlinear MPC strategy using a collocation-based algorithm is formulated to control power generation according to the demand. This strategy is successfully implemented to address scenarios that consider power load transitions (setpoint tracking) and variability in coal/slurry feed composition (disturbance rejection). The closed-loop simulation results show that power control is attained without violating process constraints related to target specifications and regulations imposed in stream temperatures and purities, including the carbon capture goal of 90% recommended by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)."

This work presents a novel algorithm to estimate turbocharger rotator speed, air temperature downstream a compressor and flow rate over the compressor using mean value models of engine subsystems. A nonlinear Luenberger observer is designed for a 1.7-lit gasoline turbocharged engine. The designed observed is shown analytically to be asymptotically stable. Performance of the designed observer is experimentally validated with the data collected from the engine. The results indicate the observer can capture major turbocharger's rotational dynamics and estimated turbocharger variables are in a good agreement with the experimental measurements."

An early-designed guidance law that orbits one UAV around the moving target is augmented with an additional term for coordination. This extra term, which can be computed based on the relative bearing angle between two UAVs, puts all UAVs into a balanced circular formation, where all agents spread evenly on a circle. Three communication topologies are considered, i.e., an all-to-all communication, a ring topology, and a cyclic pursuit topology. The effectiveness of the proposed cooperative target tracking control laws is demonstrated by numerical simulation examples."

One way to achieve this goal is to invert the system model and cascade delays to guarantee that the inverse is proper. A standing issue in input reconstruction lies in the inversion of nonminimum-phase systems, since the inverse model is unstable. In the present paper we assume that the unknown input is bounded and we present a novel technique that uses Markov parameters to determine the unknown state that minimizes the difference between the unknown input and the estimated input."
1688217,14010,8441,"Sliding mode control of electric power system comprised of fuel cells, DC-DC boost converters and ultracapacitors",2013,"The paper deals with controlling an autonomous electric power system that comprises Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) that is considered as a primary source of electrical energy, the DC-DC boost power converter, and the ultracapacitor. System's PEMFC/ultracapacitor/DC-DC boost power converter zero dynamics are analyzed and appeared to be stable. Relative degree approach is applied for direct control of the output load voltage as well as the fuel cell and ultracapacitor current in the presence of the model uncertainties.

1827335,14010,8441,Proactive fault-tolerant model predictive control: Concept and application,2013,"Fault-tolerant control methods have been extensively researched over the last ten years in the context of chemical process applications and provide a natural framework for integrating process monitoring and control aspects in a way that not only fault detection and isolation but also control system reconfiguration is achieved in the event of a process or actuator fault. But almost all the efforts are focused on the reactive fault tolerant control. As another way for fault tolerant control, proactive fault-tolerant control has been a popular topic in the communication systems and aerospace control systems communities for the last 10 years. At this point, no work has been done on proactive fault-tolerant control within the context of chemical process control. In this paper, we propose a proactive fault-tolerant Lyapunov-based model predictive controller (LMPC) that can effectively deal with an incipient control actuator fault. This approach to proactive fault-tolerant control combines the unique stability and robustness properties of LMPC as well as explicitly accounting for incipient control actuator faults in the formulation of the MPC. We apply our theoretical results to a chemical process example."

In particular, the contributions of this work include: proposing risk allocation strategies that exploit domain knowledge of agent score distributions to improve team performance, providing insights about what stochastic parameters affect the allocations and the overall mission score/performance, and providing results showing improved performance over previously published heuristic techniques in environments with given allowable risk thresholds."

1726581,14010,8441,A gram-SOS approach for robust stability analysis of discrete-time systems with time-varying uncertainty,2013,"This paper addresses the problem of establishing robust asymptotical stability of discrete-time systems affected by time-varying parametric uncertainty. Specifically, it is supposed that the coefficients of the system depend linearly on the uncertainty, and that the uncertainty is confined into a polytope. In the continuous-time case, the problem can be addressed by imposing that the system admits a common homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov function (HPLF) at the vertices of the polytope. Unfortunately, such a strategy cannot be used in the discrete-time case since the derivative of the HPLF is nonlinear in the uncertainty. The problem is addressed in this paper through linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by proposing a novel method for establishing decrease of the HPLF. This method consists, firstly, of introducing a Gram matrix built with respect to the state and parametrized by an arbitrary vector function of the uncertainty, and secondly, of requiring that a transformation of the introduced Gram matrix is a sum of squares (SOS) of matrix polynomials. The proposed method provides a condition for robust asymptotical stability that is sufficient for any degree of the HPLF candidate and that includes quadratic robust stability as special case."

Drifting maneuvers are performed by an expert driver on low friction surfaces. Driving data is recorded and used to aid the construction of two different driver models. The first model parallels the driver to a model predictive controller and the second model treats the driver as a switched linear state feedback controller. This paper compares the two approaches and presents a framework where the driver model is integrated into an autonomous controller in the form of an optimization problem.
1555069,14010,8441,Dynamic encirclement of a moving target using decentralized nonlinear Model Predictive Control,2013,"Dynamic encirclement is a tactic which can be employed by a group of UAVs to neutralize a target by restricting its movement, or provide constant surveillance of a target. The aim of the UAVs in the formation is to move into a position close to the target and establish a moving formation around the target. In this paper, the problem of creating a dynamic circular formation around a moving target is considered, and a Decentralized Model Predictive Control (DMPC) policy is formulated. Using theoretical results, a stabilizing control policy is derived, and the policy is validated through simulation results. Furthermore, we examine the effects of communications between the UAVs and the use of a model target on the performance of the UAVs. The contributions of this paper are the extension of the dynamic encirclement tactic to the case of a group of UAVs and a moving target, the consideration of a target model and communications, and the application of theoretical stability analysis to the problem."

Our controller is composed of an “internal” tracking control loop for the stator dynamics and an “external” control loop based on the so-called PI 2 D controller. The latter consists in a linear proportional derivative controller in which the measurement of velocities is replaced by approximate derivatives. Furthermore, a double integrator is added to compensate for the load uncertainty. We illustrate our theoretical findings with numerical simulations."
2390900,14010,8441,Power system dynamic scheduling with high penetration of renewable sources,2013,"In this paper, we present a model predictive control (MPC) based method for dynamic economic power scheduling in power grids. The proposed method is first applied to the power systems with relatively low penetration of renewable generation sources. The proposed MPC-based optimization method is then extended to the case, where a high penetration of renewable sources is expected. In the latter case, instead of considering power generated from renewable sources as a negative load, the system operator (SO) takes these sources into account as dispatchable in solving the scheduling problem. Various constraints pertinent to power systems including transmission congestion and generators' capacity are also considered in the optimization process. Consequently, we will show that the use of storage devices will be an effective way to reduce the cost of generation in the future generation of power systems. The effectiveness of the proposed power scheduling methods will be demonstrated using an IEEE 14-bus system combined with the California ISO data."

This paper focuses on the development of a dynamic counter-flow heat exchanger model for control purposes. The model captures the dynamic phenomena of two-phase fluid flow using the mass and energy balance equations. While most of the studies use chemical libraries to retrieve the working fluid properties, in this model mathematical equations are derived. Compared to other evaporator models, the proposed model is validated on data from a complete engine platform. Experiments are done on a state-of-the-art Euro-VI heavy-duty diesel engine, which is equipped with a Waste Heat Recovery system. For transient conditions over a wide range of operating points, simulation results show good agreement in comparison with experimental data. This makes the model suitable for real-time simulations, diagnostics and control algorithm designs."

1205871,14010,23735,Vision-based localization and mapping for an autonomous mower,2013,"This paper presents a vision-based localization and mapping algorithm for an autonomous mower. We divide the task for robotic mowing into two separate phases, a teaching phase and a mowing phase. During the teaching phase, the mower estimates the 3D positions of landmarks and defines a boundary in the lawn with an estimate of its own trajectory. During the mowing phase, the location of the mower is estimated using the landmark and boundary map acquired from the teaching phase. Of particular interest for our work is ensuring that the estimator for landmark mapping will not fail due to the nonlinearity of the system during the teaching phase. A nonlinear observer is designed with pseudo-measurements of each landmark's depth to prevent the map estimator from diverging. Simultaneously, the boundary is estimated with an EKF. Measurements taken from an omnidirectional camera, an IMU, and a ground speed sensor are used for the estimation. Numerical simulations and offline teaching phase experiments with our autonomous mower demonstrate the potential of our algorithm."

Remote sensing techniques have been proven extremely valuable in the inventory, characterization, and remediation of mine tailings elsewhere. In this study we focus on mine tailing mapping around Jebel Hallouf-Bouaouane mine using Landsat multispectral data. Field spectral data, measured on the ground by a spectroradiometer are very important and needed for mine tailing classification. These informations, more faithful to the natural conditions, are unavailable in some dates. Our methodology is based on a Spectral Modelling Approach SMA using the JPL reflectance library. The main contribution is to evaluate the tailing modelled reflectance proposed to replace the lack of the field data needed for mine tailing mapping. Linear spectral unmixing is applied for mine tailing map generation using the tailing modelled spectrum, the ASD measured spectrum and the ETM+ derived spectrum. The comparison of results indicate that the SMA approach can be applied successfully to multispectral data analysis, particularly those acquired during previous periods. The SMA can be an optimal solution to replace the lack of measured field data (by the spectroradiometer)."

The period 1999–2003 were selected. The validations were performed at monthly and annual scales. Results showed that both TRMM 3B42 and 3B43 can provide similar monthly rainfall distribution pattern with rain gauge data. Both 3B42 and 3B43 data overestimated precipitation when the rainfall amount is small while underestimated for large amount rainfall. The 3B42 data were in poor agreement with rain gauge data at both monthly and annual scales. In contrast, the 3B43 data performed significantly better than the 3B42 with higher R 2  and reduced RMSE values. Nevertheless, the 3B43 data were still unreliable in the CSR for most months and years for the period 1999–2003 as the relative RMSE are larger than 50%. Locate calibration should be carried out first to improve TRMM 3B42 and 3B43 data for further applications in the CSR."
2066948,14010,8441,Efficient distributed sensing using adaptive censoring based inference,2013,"In many distributed sensing applications it is likely that only a few agents will have valuable information at any given time. Since wireless communication between agents is resource-intensive, it is important to ensure that the communication effort is focused on communicating valuable information from informative agents. This paper presents communication-efficient distributed sensing algorithms that avoid network cluttering by having only agents with high Value of Information (VoI) broadcast their measurements to the network, while others censor themselves. A novel contribution of the presented distributed estimation algorithm is the use of an adaptively adjusted VoI threshold to determine which agents are informative. This adaptation enables the team to better balance between the communication cost incurred and the long-term accuracy of the estimation. Theoretical results are presented establishing the almost sure convergence of the communication cost and estimation error to zero for distributions in the exponential family. Furthermore, validation through real datasets shows that the new VoI-based algorithms can yield improved parameter estimates than those achieved by previously published hyperparameter consensus algorithms while incurring only a fraction of the communication cost."

2163573,14010,8441,Numerical solutions to optimal power-flow-constrained vibratory energy harvesting problems,2013,"This study addresses the formulation of optimal numerical controllers for stochastically-excited vibratory energy harvesters in which a single-directional power electronic converter is used to regulate power-flow. Single-directional converters have implementation advantages for small-scale applications, but restrict the domain of feasible controllers. Optimizing the average power generated in such systems can be accomplished by formulating the constrained control problem in terms of stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi theory. However, solving the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE) is challenging because it is a nonlinear partial differential equation. As such, we investigate the capability of the pseudospectral (PS) method to solve the HJE with mixed state-control constraints. The performance of the PS controller is computed for a single-degree-of-freedom resonant oscillator with electromagnetic coupling. We compare the PS performance to the performance of the optimal static admittance controller as well as the optimal unconstrained linear-quadratic-Gaussian controller."
637369,14010,9475,Bootstrap-based model uncertainty assessment in continuous-time subspace model identification,2013,"This paper deals with the problem of model identification in continuous-time using subspace techniques. More precisely, a recently presented continuous-time predictor-based subspace identification algorithm which relies on a system transformation using the Laguerre basis is considered and a bootstrap-based approach to the problem of quantifying the variance error associated with the identified models is proposed."
1663085,14010,9475,Stabilization of switched linear differential-algebraic equations via time-dependent switching signals,2013,We investigate stabilizability of switched systems of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). For such systems we introduce a parameterized family of switched ordinary differential equations that approximate the dynamic behavior of the switched DAE. A criterion for stabilizability of a switched DAE system using time-dependent switching is obtained in terms of these parameterized approximations. The tightness of the proposed criterion is analyzed.

Similarly to the linear case, we show that if a gain tuning on one subsystem is used to drastically reduce the effect of its exogenous disturbances, then the other subsystem's disturbance attenuation is qualitatively the same as in open loop."

1673205,14010,22164,On myopic strategies in dynamic adversarial team decision problems,2012,We introduce the notion of myopic strategy for dynamic team decision problems. We present adversarial variants of the Witsenhausen's counterexample for which such strategies are provably team optimal when the actuation noise is larger than each decision maker's sensor noise. This can be interpreted as saying that there is no advantage to coordinating in a team in the presence of significant model uncertainty.
1088824,14010,11104,Elucidative mechanism of the recession of alpine plants and the invasion of Dwarf bamboo kurilensis in the Taisetsu mountains,2013,"Global warming's influence over the last 30 years, along with soil dehydration in the Taisetsu mountains has resulted in shrubbery such as Dwarf bamboo (Dwarf bamboo kurilensis), a species of dwarf bamboo, and Japanese Stone pine (Pinus pumila) (an indicator of soil dehydration), increase in area of distribution while many herbaceous species of alpine plants have reduced in distribution area to the extent where some extinction has occurred. This study, using multipolarization of ALOS satellite PALSAR L-band microwave (HH/HV) data, has developed a model to estimate soil moisture in densely vegetated areas to clarify factors in the seasonal variation of soil moisture in an area with fluctuating vegetation and so clarify factors in the casual relationship between soil dehydration and vegetation fluctuation in a wide area. Moreover, conducting this research will enable identification of potential areas where Dwarf bamboo may easily invade, and thus contribute to environmental measures."
1748044,14010,8441,Development of control-oriented charge mixing model and experimental validation using graphical analysis,2013,"A two-zone control-oriented charge mixing model is developed to describe charge mixing with thermodynamic interaction between fresh charge and residual gas during the intake stroke. This work enables operating range of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) to be extended without loss of stability. Cylinder volume is divided into two zones with a fictitious divider. In the mixed zone, fresh charge and residual gas expelled from the unmixed zone are mixed homogeneously. Otherwise, the unmixed zone contains rest of the residual gas burned in the previous cycle and trapped by early close of exhaust valves. Incoming fresh charge with high speed expels some of residual gas from the unmixed zone to the mixed zone by force. In this perspective, mass transfer represents charge mixing between two zones. For model validation, optical engine test is carried out. Optical access to the engines with an infrared (IR) camera allows graphical analysis to estimate thermodynamic states of two zones."
2291998,14010,8441,Detecting sensor and insulin infusion set anomalies in an artificial pancreas,2013,"Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps and continuous glucose monitors enable individuals with type 1 diabetes to achieve tighter blood glucose control, and are critical components in a closed-loop artificial pancreas. Insulin infusion sets can fail and CGM sensor signals can suffer from a variety of anomalies. In this paper algorithms are developed to detect infusion set failures and sensor signal anomalies; both in-patient and out-patient studies are presented. A threshold-based method, based on high glucose concentrations, is shown to be adequate to detect infusion set failures. Pressure-induced sensor attenuation (PISA), which can occur when a subject rolls over and puts pressure on their sensor, is a particularly challenging problem. An algorithm based on non-physiological rates-of-change, coupled with a maximum attenuation time window, is developed to detect and compensate for PISAs. These algorithms can be used either in advisory mode for current open-loop technology, as well as an additional safety/fault detection layer as part of a fully closed-loop artificial pancreas."
2197333,14010,8441,Stability analysis of transportation networks with multiscale driver decisions,2011,"Stability of Wardrop equilibria is analyzed for dynamical transportation networks in which the drivers' route choices are influenced by information at multiple temporal and spatial scales. The considered model involves a continuum of indistinguishable drivers commuting between a common origin/destination pair in an acyclic transportation network. The drivers' route choices are affected by their, relatively infrequent, perturbed best responses to global information about the current network congestion levels, as well as their instantaneous local observation of the immediate surroundings as they transit through the network. A novel model is proposed for the drivers' route choice behavior, exhibiting local consistency with their preference toward globally less congested paths as well as myopic decisions in favor of locally less congested paths. The simultaneous evolution of the traffic congestion on the network and of the aggregate path preference is modeled by a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. The main result shows that, if the frequency of updates of path preferences is sufficiently small as compared to the frequency of the traffic flow dynamics, then the state of the transportation network ultimately approaches a neighborhood of the Wardrop equilibrium. The proposed analysis combines techniques from singular perturbation theory, evolutionary game theory, and cooperative dynamical systems."
1879755,14010,8441,Models and methodology for optimal vehicle maneuvers applied to a hairpin turn,2013,"There is currently a strongly growing interest in obtaining optimal control solutions for vehicle maneuvers, both in order to understand optimal vehicle behavior and to devise improved safety systems, either by direct deployment of the solutions or by including mimicked driving techniques of professional drivers. However, it is nontrivial to find the right mix of models, formulations, and optimization tools to get useful results for the above purposes. Here, a platform is developed based on a state-of-the-art optimization tool together with adoption of existing vehicle models, where especially the tire models are in focus. A minimum-time formulation is chosen to the purpose of gaining insight in at-the-limit maneuvers, with the overall aim of possibly finding improved principles for future active safety systems. We present optimal maneuvers for different tire models with a common vehicle motion model, and the results are analyzed and discussed. Our main result is that a few-state single-track model combined with different tire models is able to replicate the behavior of experienced drivers. Further, we show that the different tire models give quantitatively different behavior in the optimal control of the vehicle in the maneuver."
2534592,14010,8441,Reconfigurable fault tolerant flight control based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control,2013,"Constrained Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is shown to have potentials for reconfigurable fault tolerant control of highly nonlinear, intrinsically unstable, high performance aircraft. Results on fault tolerance of NMPC autopilots were obtained for an F-16 fighter aircraft model, without the implementation of any prestabilizing controllers. It has been shown that NMPC has inherent fault detection capabilities due to its effective utilization of feedback and its internal model predictions. Actuator (control surface) faults, including extreme cases of total actuator failure are examined as test cases for the NMPC reconfigurable fault tolerant control scheme developed in this work. The NMPC autopilots implementation and simulations were done using the ACADO nonlinear optimization solver."

Following fault detection by an adaptive diagnostic observer, the proposed controller adaptively changes the control technique to compensate for the loss of actuator effectiveness. The proposed method was applied to a ground vehicle following a rigid square wave shaped road under different faulty conditions in the steering actuator. Simplicity of the overall scheme, the speed by which the system is able to recover from the fault and excellent tracking performance under faulty conditions are the main positive features of the proposed approach."

Our results show that an excess of passivity (whether in the form of input strictly passive, output strictly passive or very strictly passive) in the approximate model guarantees a certain passivity index for the system, provided that the norm of the error between the two models is sufficiently small in a suitably defined sense. Further, we consider QSR dissipative systems and show that QSR dissipativity has a similar robustness property, even though the supply rates for the system and its approximation may be different."
849424,14010,8228,Lightweight gossip-based distribution estimation,2013,"Monitoring the global state of an overlay network is vital for the self-management of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Gossip-based algorithms are a well-known technique that can provide nodes locally with aggregated knowledge about the state of the overlay network. In this paper, we present a gossip-based protocol to estimate the global distribution of attribute values stored across a set of nodes in the system. Our algorithm estimates the distribution both efficiently and accurately. The key contribution of our algorithm is that it has substantially lower overhead than existing distribution estimation algorithms. We evaluated our system in simulation, and compared it against the state-of-the-art solutions. The results show similar accuracy to its counterparts, but with a communication overhead of an order of magnitude lower than them."

Two methods were employed to isolate faults of different types at different locations: Support vector machines (SVM) and a Kalman-like observer. SVM could isolate most faults with the used data and characteristic vectors, except for high varying dynamics. In this case, the use of an observer, which is model-based, was found necessary."
2512066,14010,8441,Optimal minimax pursuit evasion on a Manhattan grid,2013,"The optimal control of a pursuer searching for a slower moving evader on a Manhattan grid road network is considered. The pursuer does not have on-board capability to detect the evader and relies instead on Unattended Ground Sensors (UGSs) to locate the evader. We assume that all the intersections in the road network have been instrumented with UGSs. When an evader passes by an UGS location, it triggers the UGS and this time-stamped information is stored by the UGS. When the pursuer arrives at an UGS location, the UGS informs the pursuer if and when the evader passed by. When the evader and the pursuer arrive at an UGS location simultaneously, the UGS is triggered and this information is instantly relayed to the pursuer, thereby enabling “capture”.We derive exact values for the optimal worst case time to capture the evader on the Manhattan grid and the corresponding pursuit policy."

The focus is on a multi-agent network that evolves under the linear agreement protocol. The results help determine if various components of the network are distinguishable from each other, based on the choice of initial conditions and the observed output responses.

Examples are provided to elucidate the results."
2358107,14010,8441,Online state and parameter estimation of the Li-ion battery in a Bayesian framework,2013,"Due to an ever-growing role of lithium-ion batteries in industry, particularly automotive industry, an effective battery management system (BMS) is of critical importance. A reliable battery state estimation scheme is an integral part of such a BMS. Complicated nature of battery dynamics, weak observability, lack of knowledge about the degradation mechanisms of these batteries, etc has made their state estimation a challenging task. Among the published works on Li-ion battery estimation, a subject that has not received a great deal of attention is parameter estimation of the battery. Parameter estimation has a direct impact on both state of charge and state of health estimation of the battery. Most of the works in the field of battery estimation are built upon the known parameters of the battery whereas in reality these parameters change over-time and may not be known a priori, particularly for aged batteries. This work tackles the problem of parameter and state estimation of lithium-ion batteries from a model-based perspective using a multi-rate particle filter. This filter is applicable to the full-electrochemical of the battery without any restrictive assumption or simplification of the model equations. The filter is proposed in a multi-rate structure in order to address the run-time of the process and computational load of the algorithm. The simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
1786061,14010,8441,Gain-scheduled model predictive control of wind turbines using Laguerre functions,2013,This paper presents a systematic approach to design gain-scheduled predictive controllers for wind turbines. The predictive control law is based on Laguerre functions to parameterize control signals and a parameter-dependent cost function that is analytically determined from turbine data. These properties facilitate the design of speed controllers by placement of the closed-loop poles (when constraints are not active) and systematic adaptation towards changes in the operating point. Vibration control of undamped modes is achieved by imposing a certain degree of stability to the closed-loop system. The approach can be utilized to the design of new controllers and to represent existing gain-scheduled controllers as predictive controllers. The numerical example and simulations illustrate the design of a speed controller augmented with active damping of the tower fore-aft displacement.
2378689,14010,8441,On global and local consensusability of multi-agent systems with input constraint and uncertain initial conditions,2013,"In this paper we consider the consensuability problem of linear multi agent systems in the presence of input constraint and uncertain state initial conditions. By employing Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, we present low computationally on demanding LMI conditions to explicitly design a distribute protocol to guarantee network consensuability. Input norm bound constraint is full-filled despite of the uncertain network initial conditions. This is of practical interest in a real applications of consensus protocol because the input bound (i.e. due to actuator saturation) may not be easily fulfilled as the control at each node depends on the state and its uncertain initial value of the neighboring agents. The results hold for both undirected and directed graph. A numerical example about the leader-follower scenario is shown to validate the theoretical findings. From the computational point of view, the LMI conditions have the merit to be easily solved by the MATLAB toolbox as their number and size do not depend on network size. This enables their use to control large scale multi agent systems."

1742267,14010,8441,Geometric decomposition and potential-based representation of nonlinear systems,2013,"This paper considers the problem of representing a sufficiently smooth nonlinear dynamical as a structured potential-driven system. The proposed approach is based on a decomposition of a differential one-form that encodes the divergence of the given vector fields into its exact and anti-exact components, and into its co-exact and anti-coexact components. The decomposition method, based on the Hodge decomposition theorem, is rendered constructive by introducing a dual operator to the standard homotopy operator. The dual operator inverts locally the co-differential operator, and is used in the present paper to identify the structure of the dynamics. Applications of the proposed approach to gradient systems, Hamiltonian systems, and generalized Hamiltonian systems are given to illustrate the proposed approach."
2195726,14010,8441,Computationally efficient trajectory optimization for linear control systems with input and state constraints,2011,"This paper presents a trajectory generation method that optimizes a quadratic cost functional with respect to linear system dynamics and to linear input and state constraints. The method is based on continuous-time flatness-based trajectory generation, and the outputs are parameterized using a polynomial basis. A method to parameterize the constraints is introduced using a result on polynomial nonpositivity. The resulting parameterized problem remains linear-quadratic and can be solved using quadratic programming. The problem can be further simplified to a linear programming problem by linearization around the unconstrained optimum. The method promises to be computationally efficient for constrained systems with a high optimization horizon. As application, a predictive torque controller for a permanent magnet synchronous motor which is based on real-time optimization is presented."

According to the proposed method, a parallel structure for both state and parameter estimation in a nonlinear non-Gaussian system is developed.

2398228,14010,11104,Co-seismic displacement observation in decorelate belt along seismic fault of 2008 Wenchuan earthquake,2011,"In this work we employ the pixel offset tracking technique to capture large displacements in incoherent zone nearby the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault caused by 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake. The used data of 6 tracks is from ALOS/PASAR dataset of Japan. The result shows that the entire surface rupture belt is 238km long, extending almost linearly in a direction NE42°. It is offset left laterally by a NW-striking fault at Xiaoyudong and turns at Gaochuan, where the rupture belt shifts toward south by 5km largely keeping the original trend. In terms of features of rupture traces, the rupture belt can be divided into 5 sections and 3 types. North to rupture belt, surface displacements are 2.95m on average, mostly in 2.0∼3.5m with the maximum 7.0∼9.0m at individual places nearby Beichuan. South to the rupture belt, the average displacement is 1.75m, dominated by 1.0∼2.0m, with 3.0∼4.0m at a few sites. Along the Guanxian-Jiangyou fault, there is a uplift zone in the radar line of sight, which is 66km long, 1.5∼6.0km wide, with vertical displacements about 2m but no observable rupture traces."
1083253,14010,11104,The impact of aerosols on cloud and precipitation processes: cloud-resolving model simulations,2012,"• For all three cases, higher CCN produces smaller cloud droplets and a narrower spectrum. Dirty conditions delay rain formation, increase latent heat release above the freezing level, and enhance vertical velocities at higher altitude for all cases. Stronger updrafts, deeper mixed-phase regions, and more ice particles are simulated with higher CCN in good agreement with observations. • In all cases, rain reaches the ground early with lower CCN. Rain suppression is also evident in all three cases with high CCN in good agreement with observations (Rosenfeld, 1999, 2000 and others). Rain suppression, however, only occurs during the first hour of simulation. This result suggests that microphysical processes dominate the impact of aerosols on precipitation in the early stage of precipitation development. • During the mature stage of the simulations, the effect of increasing aerosol concentration ranges from rain suppression in the PRESTORM case to little effect on surface rainfall in the CRYSTAL-FACE case to rain enhancement in the TOGA COARE case. • The model results suggest that evaporative cooling is a key process in determining whether higher CCN reduces or enhances precipitation. Cold pool strength can be enhanced by stronger evaporation. When cold pool interacts with the near surface wind shear, the low-level convergence can be stronger, facilitating secondary cloud formation and more vigorous precipitation processes. Evaporative cooling is more than two times stronger at low levels with higher CCN for the TOGA COARE case during the early stages of precipitation development. However, evaporative cooling is slightly stronger at lower levels with lower CCN for the PRESTORM case. The early formation of rain in the clean environment could allow for the formation of an earlier and stronger cold pool compared to a dirty environment. PRESTORM has a very dry environment and both large and small rain droplets can evaporate. Consequently, the cold pool is relatively weaker, and the system is relatively less intense with higher CCN. • Sensitivity tests are conducted to determine the impact of ice processes on aerosol-precipitation interaction. The results suggested that ice processes are crucial for suppressing precipitation due to high CCN for the PRESTORM case. More and smaller ice particles are generated in the dirty case and transported to the trailing stratiform region. This reduces the heavy convective rain and contributes to the weakening of the cold pool. Warm rain processes dominate the TOGA COARE case. Therefore, ice processes only play a secondary role in terms of aerosol-precipitation interaction. • Two of the three cloud systems presented in this paper formed a line structure (squall system). A 2D simulation, therefore, gives a good approximation to such a line of convective clouds. Since the real atmosphere is 3D, further 3D cloud-resolving simulations are needed to address aerosol-precipitation interactions."

755913,14010,20896,WiP Abstract: A Closed Loop Control Architecture to Maintain Patient Normothermia during Perioperative Periods,2012,"Use of anesthesia and the cold environment of an operating room inhibits thermoregulation in a patient body causing perioperative hypothermia. In the worst case, this situation may cause death. Maintaining normothermia is thus a key requirement during the perioperative period. In today's state-of-the-art, normothermia is maintained through a number of manual techniques, such as monitoring and controlling the temperature of the warming blankets, fluid warmers, and air conditioning system in the operating room. Since each patient illustrates different response to stimuli, a one-size-fits-all approach to maintaining normothermia is not the right approach. This paper presents ongoing work an autonomous, closed-loop control solution to maintain patient normothermia during perioperative periods."
2485679,14010,11104,Landscape change and human activity analysis on desertification process in Northern China,2011,"The landscape change of desertification process and human activity impacts on desertification had been analyzed on the case of Yanchi County in Northern China. It is helpful to understand the process of desertification, and can help to understand how human activities contribute on the landscape change that caused to desertification. The results show that the landscape change of desertification process is mainly represented as grassland change to farmland and deserted grassland, and then change to desertifed land or sand land. Human activities can dramatically change land-use patterns and the landscape. Due to this paper's analysis, households' economic behaviors should be the most important human factors causing desertification in Northern China. As the case study of Yanchi County, the human activity factor contribution rate can be more than 60% or even more than 70%. However, human activity can often be affected by state policies, so that cause to negative or positive effects on desertification process."
2052084,14010,8441,Tuning controllers against multiple design requirements,2013,"In this paper, we introduce a new technique for tuning arbitrarily structured controllers against multiple control requirements. Control requirements encompass soft or hard design constraints in the usual H 2  and H ∞  design metrics as well as supplemental requirements such as ; μ constraints on MIMO margins at specified opening sites, ; constraints on the closed-loop dynamics, ; loop-shaping constraints at specified loop opening sites, ; controller stability enforcement. Our algorithmic approach is a non-smooth technique relying on a one-parameter driving function which leads to locally optimal solutions of the design problem. This has been implemented in the MATLAB-based tool SYSTUNE which can be regarded as an extension of HINFSTRUCT from the Robust Control Toolbox [19]. The new SYSTUNE retains the same flexibility and simplicity as HINFSTRUCT to specify control structures but is tailored to handle multiple models and requirements. Two challenging applications are discussed to illustrate the capabilities of the new technique."
1711427,14010,8441,Iterative optimal and adaptive control of a near isothermal liquid piston air compressor in a compressed air energy storage system,2013,"The power density and efficiency of high compression ratio (~200:1) air compressors/expanders are crucial for the economical viability of a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system such as the one proposed in [1]. There is a trade-off between power density and efficiency that is strongly dependent on the heat transfer capability within compressor/expander. In previous papers, we have shown that the compression or expansion trajectory can be optimized so that for a given power, the efficiency can be optimized and vice versa. Theoretically, for high compression ratios, the improvement over ad-hoc trajectories can be significant- for example, at the same efficiency of 90%, the power can be increased by 3-5 folds [2], [3], [4], [5]. Yet, the optimal trajectories depend on the heat transfer coefficient profile that is often unknown. In this paper, we focus on the experimental study of an iterative control algorithm to track a compression trajectory that optimizes the efficiency-power trade-off in a liquid piston air compressor. First, an adaptive controller is developed to track any desired compression trajectory characterized by the temperature-volume profile. The controller adaptively estimates the unknown heat transfer coefficient. Second, the estimated heat transfer coefficient from one iteration is then used to estimate the optimal compression trajectory for the next iteration. As the estimate of the heat transfer coefficient improves from one iteration to the next, the quality of the estimated optimal trajectory also improves. This leads to successively improved efficiency. The experimental results of optimal trajectories show up to 2% improvement in compression efficiency compared to linear trajectories in a same power density."
2438625,14010,8441,A computationally efficient thermal model of cylindrical battery cells for the estimation of radially distributed temperatures,2013,"This paper presents a computationally efficient thermal model of a cylindrical lithium ion battery for real-time applications. Such a model can be used for thermal management of the battery system in electrified vehicles. The thermal properties are modeled by volume averaged lumped values under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic volume. A polynomial approximation is then used to estimate the radial temperature distribution that arises from heat generation inside the cell during normal operation. Unlike previous control oriented models, which use discretization of the heat equation, this model formulation uses two states to represent the average value of temperature and its gradient. The model is parameterized using experimental data from a 2.3 Ah 26650 Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LiFePO 4  or LFP) battery cell. Finally, a Kalman filter is applied based on the reduced order thermal model using measurements of current, voltage and surface temperature of the cell and ambient temperature. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated against core temperature measurements."
2235286,14010,8441,H 2 model matching feedforward control for tape head positioning servo systems,2013,"Increasing track densities on tape is a critical step to improve the areal storage capacity and the data transfer rate of tape storage technology. The tape industry envisions increasing track densities from 5,000 tracks per inch (TPI) to more than 50,000 TPI in the next decade. The higher track densities reduce the track pitch significantly and require the tape head servo system to position the read/write head assembly more precisely. While tape transports longitudinally, the tape moves in the lateral direction as well and this motion causes displacements between the head and the desired track. In order to improve the performance of the head positioning servo system to meet the requirements of higher track densities, the disturbance due to the lateral tape motion (LTM) has to be addressed. This paper applies H 2  model matching methods to find an optimal feedforward controller that minimizes the norm of the transfer function from the disturbance to the position error. The existence of a non-trivial solution to the model matching problem is discussed, considering the dynamics of the plant and the disturbance. To constrain the size of the feedforward input to the tape head actuator, the H 2  model matching problem is augmented to minimize the variance of the position error and the size of a weighted norm on the feedforward control simultaneously. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the feedforward control, provided a solution exists."
2530772,14010,8441,Convex relaxation of sequential optimal input design for a class of structured large-scale systems: process gain estimation,2013,"This paper considers optimal input design for a class of structured large-scale systems in which the input-output directionality is independent of frequency. For maximizing the information contained in experimental data collected from applying inputs to the process, manipulated variables are computed from solving constrained optimizations for which the payoff function is related to the covariance of estimation or a user-specified quality measure of estimation and the constraints correspond to requirements for operational safety and actuator limitations. The methods are applied to process gain estimation for a simulated blown film process to illustrate the input design procedure and compare the results for two different types of constraint sets. In addition, closed-form solutions are computed for the optimal input design associated with signal-to-noise ratio, D-optimality, and A-optimality measures in the presence of an input sum-of-squares constraint. A new measure for sensitivity of optimality criteria to the change in input direction is introduced and computed for the three aforementioned optimality criteria."
2004656,14010,8441,Structured model reduction of interconnected linear systems based on singular perturbation,2013,"This paper proposes a singular perturbation approximation that preserves system passivity and an interconnection topology among subsystems. In the first half of this paper, we develop a singular perturbation approximation valid for stable linear systems. Using the relation between the singular perturbation and the reciprocal transformation, we derive a tractable expression of the error system in the Laplace domain, which provides a novel insight to regulate the approximating quality of reduced models. Then in the second half, we develop a structured singular perturbation approximation that focuses on a class of interconnected systems. This structured approximation provides a reduced model that not only possesses fine approximating quality, but also preserves the original interconnection topology and system passivity."

However, its application on plants with fast time constants is difficult because of its computationally expensive algorithm. In this research, we propose a parallelized MPC that makes use of the structure of the computations and the matrices in the MPC. We show that the computational time of MPC with prediction horizon N can be reduced to O(log(N)) using parallel computing, which is significantly less than that with other available algorithms."

This paper presents a new model order reduction (MOR) scheme for TDSs with state time delays. It is the first time to reduce a TDS using balanced truncation. The Lyapunov-type equations for TDSs are derived, and an analysis of their computational complexity is presented. To reduce the computational cost, we approximate the controllability and observability Gramians in the frequency domain. The reduced-order models (ROMs) are then obtained by balancing and truncating the approximate Gramians. Numerical examples are presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm."

A backstepping invertible transformation is used to design a suitable boundary feedback control so that the closed-loop system is equivalent to a target system of PDE-PDE cascades, which is shown to be exponentially stable in some Hilbert space. With the boundary input from the heat equation, the reaction-diffusion PDE is shown to be exponentially stable in H -1 (0, 1), and the stability of the heat equation is shown to be characterized in terms of a subspace of H 1 (0, 1) rather than the usual L 2 (0, 1)."

The proposed algorithm only requires iterative experiments on the system. Especially for the multivariable situation that is considered in this paper, these experiments have to be judiciously chosen. The proposed algorithm delivers an estimate of the ℌ ∞ -norm of an unknown multivariable system, without the need or explicit construction of a (parametric or non-parametric) model. The results are experimentally demonstrated on model-error-modeling of a multivariable industrial active vibration isolation system. Finally, connections to learning control algorithms are established."

1091851,14010,11104,Effects of leaf surface wax on leaf spectrum and hyperspectral vegetation indices,2013,"Many hyperspectral vegetation indices can be used to estimate the biochemical contents such as pigment content, nondestructively. These reflectance indices are influenced by some leaf surface structure, such as wax, and the existence of the wax affects the performance of the indices on the estimation of the biochemical contents. This research studied the possible effects of the leaf surface wax on the reflectance of the same leaf before and after removal of leaf wax. We found that dewaxing had decreased the reflectance between wavelength 400 and 1000nm, and the decrease depends on the wavelength. The changes of 37 hyperspectral indices before and after the wax removal were compared. The results revealed that some indices such as PSNDb, R672/R550, SIPI and WBI were not affected much by the dewaxing process and are thought relatively robust to estimate the biochemical contents."
861301,14010,20896,Cyber-physical tactile imaging system for malignant tumor identification,2013,"In this paper, we introduce a Cyber-Physical Tactile Imaging System (TIS) for identifying malignant tumors. The sensing is based on the principle of total internal reflection (TIR) of light. CP-TIS will estimate mechanical properties such as size and elasticity of the embedded objects (e.g. tumor). Based on the mechanical properties determined by TIS, it is possible to generate a malignancy score, since studies have shown that malignant tumors tend to be larger and stiffer. Clinical Breast Examination (CBE) is one of the qualitative techniques used by doctors for early detection of breast tumors. However, this method is effective only in detecting lesions, but not in classifying tumor malignancy. Also this is a subjective method where the performance depends on how the doctors perform CBE. Therefore, it is advantageous to quantify the mechanical properties of a tumor for objective tumor identification.   Fig. 1 shows a schematic of CP-TIS. The system consists of physical and cyber components. In the physical component, there are 1, 2,..., N number of TIS with operators, laptops, and targets. The TIS includes an optical sensing probe made of Polydimethylsiloxane, a light source unit made of four light emitting diodes, a camera unit, a computer unit, a force gauge unit, as shown in Fig 2. Due to the TIR, the system does not detect anything until the contours of the sensing probe changes. However, light scatters and our TIS will capture this image when the pressure is applied to the probe. The operators use TIS on the target to capture tactile images. The images are transferred to cyber component of the system for processing and analyzing through a communication network such as Wi-Fi. The images are processed and mechanical properties are estimated in the computation unit. This information is stored in a database with patient information. Then we compute malignancy score using Machine Learning Algorithm such as Support Vector Machine. The score helps the doctors and patients to decide whether to seek further medical help.   In this demonstration, a prototype TIS will be shown. A direct contact experiment was performed on various phantoms to capture tactile images. The images were then processed and analyzed to estimate size and elasticity. The phantoms were made of silicone, silicone rubber, and Polyvinyl Chloride-Plastisol (PVC-Plastisol). In the laboratory environment, the relative errors for size estimation were found to be at least 3.57% for the silicone phantom, 1.82% for the PVC-Plastisol phantom, and 0.90% for the silicone rubber. The relative errors for elasticity estimation were found to be 4.83% for the PVC-Plastisol phantom, and 5.50% for the silicone rubber. A pilot clinical study was conducted on twenty breast cancer patients in Temple University Hospital following the IRB protocol no. 13661. The estimated elasticity was correlated with the biopsy results. Preliminary results show that a sensitivity of 66.70% and a specificity of 91.70% for elasticity.

2229347,14010,8441,Interaction analysis of control systems employed in roll-to-roll printing,2013,"Roll-to-roll (R2R) machines have been extensively used to manufacture a wide variety of consumer products, such as paper, plastics, textile, etc. R2R machines facilitate continuous processing of materials with minimal stoppage time and provide significant improvement in productivity over batch manufacturing. With recent advances in technology it is now possible to manufacture flexible electronics, flexible digital displays, solar films, etc., using R2R processing. R2R processing of flexible electronics requires better understanding of machine and process dynamics to achieve tight tolerances required in their manufacturing. One of the conventional R2R processes that is critical to enable R2R processing of flexible electronics is printing. In this paper, machine and process dynamics for R2R printing are studied in detail. Specifically two control configurations, depending on the type of control input, are analyzed; a compensator based registration control strategy (CRC) typically used with mechanical line shafts (MLS) and a print cylinder angular position based registration control (PARC) strategy used typically with electronic line shafts (ELS), are compared. A comparison of these strategies is given based on a dynamic model for the print section, which includes governing equations for strain in the material, print cylinder velocities, and registration error (a metric that quantifies print quality). An interaction metric is used to analyze interaction of key process variables between print units. Model simulations are conducted for different scenarios to evaluate the strategies. Results of the model simulations are presented and discussed."

The competitive and high-volume nature of the industry mean that small gains in efficiency translate to significant cost savings and ultimately lower prices. For each day, the problem is to choose which orders to print and the press sheets to print them on that would minimize the total cost of production. We formulate this problem as an integer linear program and find feasible solutions using traditional solvers. This method was compared with optimization by hand in a real factory and significant cost savings were found."

After a detailed review of contributions in the literature, a comprehensive mathematical model of flow acoustics is deduced based on the conservation of mass and momentum where fluid viscosity and thermal conductivity is not considered. Then a novel solution based on the Bessel-Fourier theory, which is orthogonal and complete in Lebesgue Space, is proposed which can transform the second-order differential equation to algebraic equations. For uniform mean flow profile, the simplified solution deduced from the present method is consistent with the contribution in the literature."
1330772,14010,339,Quantified risk-adaptive access control for patient privacy protection in health information systems,2011,"In traditional access control systems, security administrators determine whether an information consumer can access a certain resource. However, in reality, it is very difficult for policy makers to foresee what information a user may need in various situations. In hospitals, failing to authorize a doctor for the medical information she needs about a patient could lead to severe or fatal consequences. In this paper, we propose a practical access control approach to protect patient privacy in health information systems by taking the realities in healthcare into consideration. First, unlike traditional access control systems, our proposed access control model allows information consumers (i.e. doctors) to make access decisions, while still being able to detect and control the over-accessing of patients' medical data by quantifying the risk associated with doctors' data-accessing activities. Second, we do not require doctors to do anything special in order to use our system. We learn about common practices among doctors and apply statistical methods and information theory techniques to quantify the risk of privacy violation. Third, occasional exceptions on information needs, which is common in healthcare, is taken into account in our model. We have implemented a prototype of our solution and performed simulations on real-world medical history records."
1872157,14010,8441,Discriminative sparse representations with applications,2013,"Significant advances in compressive sensing and sparse signal encoding have provided a rich set of mathematical tools for signal analysis and representation. In addition to novel formulations for enabling sparse solutions to underdetermined systems, exciting progress has taken place in efficiently solving these problems from an optimization theoretic viewpoint. The focus of the wide body of literature in compressive sensing/sparse signal representations has however been on the problem of signal recovery from a small number of measurements (equivalently a sparse coefficient vector). This tutorial will discuss the design of sparse signal representations explicitly for the purposes of signal classification. The tutorial will focus on and build upon two significant recent advances. First, the work by Wright et al. which advocates the use of a dictionary (or basis) matrix comprising of class-specific training sub-dictionaries. In this framework, a test signal is modeled as a sparse linear combination of training vectors in the dictionary, sparsity being enforced by the assertion that only coefficients corresponding to one class (from which the test signal is drawn) ought to be active. The second set of ideas we leverage are recent key contributions in model-based compressive sensing where prior information or constraints on sparse coefficients are used to enhance signal recovery. These ideas will be combined towards the exposition of current trends: namely the development of class-specific priors or constraints to capture structure on sparse coefficients that helps explicitly distinguish between signal classes. In the second part of the tutorial, applications will be discussed including: 1.) structured sparsity for classification of medical imagery for diagnostics, 2.) low-rank approximation and sparse recovery for visual data reconstruction, and 3.) sparse representations for target detection and classification in hyperspectral imagery (guest speaker from the US Army Research Lab)."

Eurasia was selected as the study area. First, we estimated FPAR in 2006 by the NDVI-based approach, and then we compared the spatial and seasonal patterns of estimating FPAR with the MODIS standard product. The results showed that: the GIMMS NDVI SR FPAR show the consistent dynamics spatial and seasonal dynamics with MODIS FPAR, and two datasets capture the seasonal variation well. MODIS FPAR values are larger than GIMMS NDVI SR FPAR, especially for the forest vegetation. The differences among of two datasets can also be partly attributed to the biome specific MODIS algorithm and NDVI-based approach in this study."
1977179,14010,8441,Distributed fusion Kalman filtering with communication constraints,2013,"This paper is concerned with the distributed Kalman filtering problem for a class of networked multi-sensor fusion systems (NMFSs) under the assumptions that (i) distributed sensors have computation capabilities, (ii) the communication between the sensors and the fusion center (FC) is subject to finite communication bandwidth. The communication bandwidth constraint considered is that only partial components of the local vector estimation signals are allowed to be transmitted to the FC at a particular time, and multiple binary variables are introduced to model this component transmitting process. A novel compensation strategy is proposed to restructure the local estimation signal at the FC end, and a recursively distributed fusion kalman filter (DFKF) is designed in the linear minimum variance sense from the restructured local unbiased-estimators. It is shown that the mean-square error (MSE) of the designed DFKF is dependent on the introduced binary variables, and a simply suboptimal judgement criterion is proposed to determine a group of binary variables such that MSE of the designed DFKF is minimal at each time step."

If K is a closed set, its invariance kernel is the largest subset of K with the property of being positively invariant for arbitrary measurable input signals. It is shown that the boundary of the invariance kernel is a concatenation of solutions of two so-called extremal vector fields. Moreover, only the solutions through a finite number of special points are of interest. This result makes it possible to devise an algorithm which determines the invariance kernel of a simply connected set in a finite number of steps."
2475871,14010,8441,On filter consistency of discrete-time nonlinear systems with partial-state measurements,2013,"Linearized filters, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), often become inconsistent, when applied to observable nonlinear systems with partial-state measurements (where the full state cannot be reconstructed from the measurements at each time step). Relying on a novel decomposition of the observability matrix with respect to different measurement sources (sensors), we show that the standard EKF acquires spurious information from the measurements of each source, which erroneously reduces the uncertainty of the state estimates and hence causes inconsistency. With this key insight, we propose two EKF algorithms which compute the Jacobians in such as way so as to ensure that all decompositions of the observability matrix have nullspace of correct dimension. In the first, the linearization points are selected so as to minimize linearization errors under the constraints that the decompositions of the observability matrix have the appropriate nullspace. In the second, we project the most accurate measurement Jacobian (i.e., computed using the latest, and thus the best, state estimates as in the standard EKF) onto the actual information-available directions. We test the proposed algorithms in a two-radar target tracking example and show that significant performance improvement over the standard EKF is attained."
1714172,14010,8441,"Combining self-sensing with an unkown-input-observer to estimate the displacement, the force and the state in piezoelectric cantilevered actuators",2013,"Self-sensing techniques is defined as the use of an actuator as a sensor at the same time. The main advantage of such techniques is the embeddability and the packageability of the systems. This paper deals with the development of a self-sensing technique able to estimate the displacement, the force and the state in piezoelectric cantilevered actuators. The main novelties relative to previous works are: 1) three signals (displacement, force and states) are provided at the same time instead of only two (displacement and force), 2) and these three signals are provided in a complete way, i.e. low and high frequency information can be provided (instead of exclusively low or high frequency). It is therefore possible to further use the measurement for a displacement control or for a force control by using the output feedback methods or by using modern control methods (state-feedback). In order to allow such measurement possibilities, the proposed approach consists in combining an unknown-input-observer (UIO) with the classical electrical circuit of a self-sensing. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

We model sampling instances (in a networked system) using jumps between states of a continuous-time Markov chain. We introduce a cost function for this Markov chain which is composed of terms depending on the average sampling frequencies of the subsystems and the effort needed for changing the parameters of the underlying Markov chain. By extending Brockett's recent contribution in optimal control of Markov chains, we extract an optimal scheduling policy to fairly allocate network resources (i.e., access to the network) among the control loops. We apply this scheduling policy to a networked control system composed of several scalar decoupled subsystems and compute upper bounds for their closed-loop performance. We illustrate the developed results numerically on a networked system composed of several water tanks."

1335343,14010,11104,Rapid determination of earthquake magnitude and displacement field from GPS-observed coseismic offsets for tsunami warning,2012,"Rapid assessment of the tsunamigenic potential of an earthquake as well as a prediction of the likely propagation pattern of the tsunami support reliable tsunami early warning. Availability of the coseismic surface displacements with low latency can support the assessment of the tsunamigenic potential of an earthquake and improve predictions of the propagation pattern of the tsunami. We use a fingerprint methodology for the rapid determination of the static co-seismic displacement field and an unbiased magnitude estimate from GNSS displacements. The fingerprint methodology requires a priori knowledge of the faults potentially involved in a rupture. The known faults are parametrized with standard elements and for each element so-called fingerprint functions are computed for unit strike and dip slips. After an event, the model space of all reasonable fault-element combinations is searched for the element-slip combination best fitting the observed displacements, which provides the best estimate of the earthquake displacement field and magnitude. Here we describe the fingerprint methodology and discuss the limitations of the current system."

These methodssearchforpixelsintheimagewithspectralcharacteristicsthatdiffer from the background. The most widespread detectiontest, the RX-detector, is based on the Mahalanobis distanceand on the background statistical characterization throughthe mean vector and the covariance matrix. Although non-Gaussiandistributionshavealreadybeenintroducedforback-ground modeling in Hyperspectral Imaging, the parametersestimation is still performed using the Maximum LikelihoodEstimates for Gaussian distribution. This paper describesrobust estimation procedures more suitable for non-Gaussianenvironment. Therefore, they can be used as plug-in estima-tors for the RX-detector leading to some great improvementin the detection process. This theoretical improvement hasbeen evidenced over two real hyperspectral images.Index Terms  hypespectral imaging, anomaly detec-tion, elliptical distributions, M-estimators1. INTRODUCTIONTarget detection (TD) and anomaly detection (AD) of mul-tidimensional signals have proved to be valuable techniquesin a wide range of applications, including search-and-rescue,surveillance, rare mineral and land mines detection, etc (seefor e.g. [1, 2]). TD aims to discover the presence of a specicsignal of interest (the target) among a set of signals. Statisti-calTDisbasedontheNeyman-Pearson(NP)criterion,whichmaximizes the probability of detection for a given probabil-ity of false alarm. AD is a special case of TD in which noa-priori target is provided. Hence, the goal of AD is to de-tect signals that are anomalous respect to the background.The Reed-Xiaoli (RX) AD algorithm [3] is considered asthe benchmark algorithm in multidimensional AD. However,the RX detector performance strongly relies on the statisticalparameters estimation. Accordingly, when the backgroundis non-homogeneous or the noise independence assumptionis not fullled, the detector performance can be deteriorated.Here, we highlight a third drawback in the estimation prob-lems: the presence of outliers in the secondary data used forthe parameters estimation.In hyperspectral imaging, the actual distribution of the back-ground pixels differs from the theoretically predicted underGaussian hypothesis. In fact, as stated in [4], the empir-ical distribution usually has heavier tails compared to theGaussian distribution, and these tails strongly inuence theobserved false-alarm rate of the detector. One of the mostgeneral and acknowledged model for background statisticscharacterization is the family of Elliptically-Contoured Dis-tributions (ECD). They account for non-Gaussianity provid-ing a long tailed alternative to multivariate normal model.They are proven to represent a more accurate characteriza-tion of HSI than models based on Gaussian assumption [4].Although non-Gaussian distributions have already been as-sumed for background modeling, the parameters estimationis still performed using classical Gaussian based estimators;as in the case of covariance matrix, generally determined bythe Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM) and the mean vectorwith the Sample Mean Vector (SMV). These classical esti-mators correspond to the Maximum Likelihood Estimators(MLE) for Gaussian assumption. However, they lead to sub-optimal detection schemes when the noise is a non-Gaussianprocess. When working on ECD framework the model canbe used to assess the robustness of statistical procedures andto derive alternative robust estimators of the parameters, themean vector and the covariance matrix [5, 6]. These can thenbe used as plug-in estimators in place of the unknown meanvector or/and of the covariance matrix. This is a simple butoften efcient method to obtain robust properties for signalprocessors derived under the Gaussian assumption.2.

1730150,14010,8441,Delay of side pull-in for an electrostatic comb drive model with rotational degree of freedom,2013,"We analyze the dynamics of an electrostatic comb drive model with one translational and one rotational degree of freedom, and show that an oscillatory voltage profile can significantly delay the onset of the rotational side pull-in instability. The result is facilitated by a simplified capacitance model that restricts the rotation to be small, but allows the translation to be large. The model further assumes that mechanical restoring forces are provided by linear springs, with the rotational spring much stiffer than the translational spring. Under these assumptions, translation and rotation are coupled only by the common input. Choosing the drive voltage to be a periodic puts the rotational dynamics in the form of Hill's equation. The input is restricted to be a piecewise constant bilevel signal, and Floquet theory is applied to compute a map of stabilizing input parameters. The results are validated against hybrid finite-element/lumped parameter simulations, with excellent agreement."
1689533,14010,8441,Modeling and control of optical fiber micropositioning in a thermal adhesive,2013,"An actuation and control concept for alignment of optical fibers in compact imaging systems, namely endoscopic microscopy probes, is presented. The system uses a thermal adhesive to allow repeated positioning of the optical fiber, allowing partial compensation for alignment errors arising from mechanical settling and adhesive drying behavior during manual instrument assembly. A lumped-parameter dynamic model for temperature-dependent adhesive behavior is proposed, together with a simple integral controller. Experimental testing with a larger mock-up is used to verify that the dynamic model can replicate system behavior and to evaluate controller performance. Positioning of a 100 μm diameter fiber with 5 μm accuracy after 3-4 iterations is achieved in the prototype system."
1693296,14010,8441,A haptic-based traction control system,2013,"This paper presents a haptic support system for traction control (HTC). The haptic gas pedal exerts a wheel slip dependent force; this enables an efficient information transfer so that the driver is able to close the loop. The paper presents the basic rationale and validates it with an experimental campaign carried out with a driver-in-the-loop simulator. Two challenging driving scenarios are explored with numerous test subjects. The system improves safety without negatively affecting performance. The occurrences of loss of control are reduced from 35% without HTC to 10% with HTC. The subjective feedback from the test drivers is also analyzed, showing a good level of acceptance."
1758852,14010,8441,Feedforward for flexible systems with time-varying performance locations,2013,"Increasing demands for higher throughput in high-performance motion systems, e.g. waferstages or pick-and-place machines, lead to more aggressive motion profiles (higher accelerations), a stiffer design and/or larger wafer sizes (higher mass). Therefore, larger actuation forces are required, which puts stricter demands on actuators, amplifiers and cooling. However, this design paradigm has reached the boundary of its scalability. Therefore, the next generation of high-performance motion systems are designed to be lightweight. For this class of systems the location where the tool operates, e.g. the area to be exposed or component to be placed, is constantly varying. Due to the lightweight design and the changing position of the performance output location, the system dynamics to be considered for feedforward are changing as well, i.e. the flexible modes are observed differently. This paper presents a model-based feedforward method for flexible systems with time-varying performance locations. This method is experimentally validated on a two-mass setup with flexible shaft."
2419406,14010,8441,Toward energy-optimizing rotary wing MAV formations,2013,"A bio-inspired energy-optimizing control methodology for a formation of rotary-wing Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) is proposed. The key idea is that the recirculating airflow induced by each vehicle can be used to provide an upward airflow to a neighbor in the formation. The recirculating airflow around each vehicle is modeled using a doublet field, and the effects of recirculation on each vehicle in the formation are accounted for. A separation-bearing controller is implemented for a leader-follower formation, and the optimal formation is determined. It is found that the effects of recirculation are relatively weak, and only a single vehicle at a time can be the beneficiary of the recirculating flow of the rest of the formation. Within the optimal configuration, significant reduction in hover power can be realized for the lead vehicle."
2519640,14010,8441,Modular scalable system for operation and testing of UAVs,2013,"In this paper we present a system for operation and testing of different UAVs. The system allows easy development and modification of control and mission software. The system is composed of hard- and software modules with a standardized interface. We have been using the system with rotary and fixed wing UAVs with a take-off mass between 10 and 100 kg. For larger platforms the system can be used in a redundant setup. The software modules are integrated in a special real-time framework, which supports execution, scheduling, communication and system monitoring. A modular simulation and control infrastructure allows for flexible, integrated design and analysis of control laws. The code for the computational part of the modules can be generated from Matlab/Simulink-models or from Modelica-models. The system supports debugging, soft- and hardware in the loop simulations, operator training as well as real flight experiments. The main design concepts are explained at hand of our solar powered high altitude platform ELHASPA and the 10 years experience in development and operation will be summarized."
1641015,14010,8441,RF source-seeking by a micro aerial vehicle using rotation-based angle of arrival estimates,2013,"We investigate a computationally and memory efficient algorithm for radio frequency (RF) source-seeking with a single-wing rotating micro aerial vehicle (MAV) equipped with a directional antenna. The MAV is assumed to have no knowledge of its position and to have only an estimate of orientation through a magnetometer. A key novelty of our approach is in exploiting the rotation of the MAV and the directionality of its RF antenna to derive estimates of the angle of arrival (AOA) at each rotation. The MAV then follows the estimated direction until the next rotation is complete. We prove convergence of this greedy algorithm under rather weak assumptions on the noise associated with the AOA estimates, using recent results on the property of recurrence for systems governed by stochastic difference inclusions. These convergence results are supplemented by simulations quantifying the amount of excess travel, relative to the straight line distance to the source. Indoor experiments using Lockheed Martin's Samarai MAV demonstrate the efficacy of the greedy algorithm both for static source-seeking, and for the more challenging problem of tracking a moving source."
2064099,14010,8441,Certificate for safe emergency shutdown of wind turbines,2013,"To avoid damage to a wind turbine in the case of a fault or a large wind gust, a detection scheme for emergency shutdown is developed. Specifically, the concept of a safety envelope is introduced. Within the safety envelope, the system can be shutdown without risking structural damage to the turbine. To demarcate the boundary of the safety envelope, a protection certificate, is computed. To this end, a model-based framework of barrier certificates is used. As a result, the protection certificate problem is formulated as a sum-of-squares program with the optimisation criterion related to the volume of the safety envelope. The framework enables the inclusion of a bounded wind disturbance and the a priori known emergency shutdown procedure. For this purpose, the model of a wind turbine is developed that includes structural safety critical components."
1954779,14010,8441,Convergence of distributed averaging and maximizing algorithms Part II: State-dependent graphs,2013,"In this paper, we formulate and investigate a generalized consensus algorithm which makes an attempt to unify distributed averaging and maximizing algorithms considered in the literature. Each node iteratively updates its state as a time-varying weighted average of its own state, the minimal state, and the maximal state of its neighbors. In Part I of the paper, time-dependent graphs are studied. This part of the paper focuses on state-dependent graphs. We use a μ-nearest-neighbor rule, where each node interacts with its μ nearest smaller neighbors and the μ nearest larger neighbors. It is shown that μ+1 is a critical threshold on the total number of nodes for the transit from finite-time to asymptotic convergence for averaging, in the absence of node self-confidence. The threshold is 2μ if each node chooses to connect only to neighbors with unique values. The results characterize some similarities and differences between distributed averaging and maximizing algorithms."
1545860,14010,8441,Application of principal component pursuit to process fault detection and diagnosis,2013,"Data-driven process monitoring has been extensively discussed in both academia and industry because of its applicability and effectiveness. One of the most applied techniques is the principal component analysis (PCA). Recently a new technique called principal component pursuit (PCP) is introduced. Compared to PCA, PCP is more robust to outliers. In this paper, the application of the PCP technique to process monitoring is thoroughly discussed from training data preprocessing to residual signal post-filtering. A new scaling preprocessing step is proposed to improve quality of data matrices in the sense of low coherence. A residual generator and a post-filter suitable for PCP generated process models are also provided. The post-filtered residual represents the fault signal, which makes the fault detection, isolation and reconstruction procedures simple and straightforward. A numerical example is provided to describe and illustrate the PCP-based process modeling and monitoring procedures."
1919215,14010,8441,Modeling and linear control of a flapping-wing MAV with split-amplitude and phase-modulated wingbeat,2013,"In this paper we propose a new wingbeat control strategy with split amplitudes and phase shifting for a six-degree-of-freedom flapping-wing micro air vehicle (MAV) model. Implementation of the amplitude and phase modulation is discussed, and cycle-averaged forces and moments and cycle-averaged control derivatives are computed to derive nonlinear and linear control design models (CDMs) of the MAV. The proposed wingbeat control strategy is capable of generating non-zero cycle-averaged longitudinal and vertical forces, and non-zero cycle-averaged rolling, pitching, and yawing moments. A thorough analysis of all possible output candidates is done based on the existence of vector relative degree and characteristics of the internal dynamics of the linear CDM. Finally, a controller is designed based on the normal form of the linear CDM resulting from the selected outputs. The controller is tested on a higher-fidelity instantaneous blade-element model, where parametric uncertainties are also taken into consideration."
2038445,14010,8441,Effect of storage characteristics on wind intermittency mitigation effectiveness,2013,"Stochastic variations and unpredictability of wind energy are the major concerns of power industry and hinder the wide scale adoption of wind power. Compensation of short term variability is one of the major challenges that the industry will face in the coming years. We analyze the potential impact of advanced control and storage technologies in reducing the intermittency of wind power. Using the convex optimization techniques we study the theoretical limits on the performance of storage technologies. Specifically we analyze the interplay between the variations of electric power fluctuations and the technical characteristics of storage available in the system. We quantify the trade-off between the reduction in power intermittency, storage capacity, power rating, and overall system efficiency."
1588724,14010,8441,Biomolecular resource utilization in elementary cell-free gene circuits,2013,"We present a detailed dynamical model of the behavior of transcription-translation circuits in vitro that makes explicit the roles played by essential molecular resources. A set of simple two-gene test circuits operating in a cell-free biochemical `breadboard' validate this model and highlight the consequences of limited resource availability. In particular, we are able to confirm the existence of biomolecular `crosstalk' and isolate its individual sources. The implications of crosstalk for biomolecular circuit design and function are discussed."
2361728,14010,8441,Predicting oxygen saturation levels in blood using autoregressive models: A threshold metric for evaluating predictive models,2013,"This paper presents preliminary results for using data driven models to describe the natural dynamics of the Pulse Oximetry Monitoring signals. Linear autoregressive discrete time models are used to predict future levels of oxygen saturation in patients' blood. While standard modeling methods are used in identifying dynamic systems models for these physiological signals, a performance objective based on a threshold is proposed to evaluate the predictive models. We discuss why standard evaluation metrics that have been commonly used in analyzing engineering systems may not be relevant for physiological ones even though standard modeling techniques may still give acceptable results. Using the proposed evaluation metric, we show that the combination of predictive models with frequent pulse oximetry measurements can be used as a warning of critical oxygen desaturation events that might have adverse effects on the health of patients."
2163596,14010,8441,On opinion dynamics in heterogeneous networks,2011,"This paper studies the opinion dynamics model recently introduced by Hegselmann and Krause: each agent in a group maintains a real number describing its opinion; and each agent updates its opinion by averaging all other opinions that are within some given confidence range. The confidence ranges are distinct for each agent. This heterogeneity and state-dependent topology leads to poorly-understood complex dynamic behavior. We classify the agents via their interconnection topology and, accordingly, compute the equilibria of the system. We conjecture that any trajectory of this model eventually converges to a steady state under fixed topology. To establish this conjecture, we derive two novel sufficient conditions: both conditions guarantee convergence and constant topology for infinite time, while one condition also guarantees monotonicity of the convergence. In the evolution under fixed topology for infinite time, we define leader groups that determine the followers' rate and direction of convergence."
2318405,14010,8441,Control of electric power transmission networks with massive energy storage using economic MPC,2013,"The classic approach to generator dispatch in large scale power generation and distribution systems (under regulated markets) is the Unit Commitment (UC) problem. As renewable power sources (that cannot be dispatched) are added to the network many have advocated the additional introduction of massive energy storage facilities. However, the inherent dynamic nature of energy storage suggests an expanded view of the classic UC operating policy. In this work, the notion of Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) is investigated as a generalization of the classic UC policy. Of particular interest is the selection of EMPC prediction horizon size and its impact on storage utilization."
1677034,14010,8441,Formation flying of small satellites using suboptimal MPSP guidance,2013,"Using the recently developed model predictive static programming (MPSP), a suboptimal guidance logic is presented in this paper for formation flying of small satellites. Due to the inherent nature of the problem formulation, MPSP does not require the system dynamics to be linearized. The proposed guidance scheme is valid both for high eccentricity chief satellite orbits as well as large separation distance between chief and deputy satellites. Moreover, since MPSP poses the desired conditions as a set of `hard constraints', the final accuracy level achieved is very high. The proposed guidance scheme has been tested successfully for a variety of initial conditions and for a variety of formation commands as well. Comparison with standard Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution (which serves as a guess solution for MPSP) and another nonlinear controller, State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) reveals that MPSP guidance achieves the objective with higher accuracy and with lesser amount of control usage as well."
2259309,14010,8441,Control strategy for an off-grid hybrid stirling engine/supercapacitor power generation system,2013,"In this paper, a novel control strategy is proposed for a hybrid Stirling engine/supercapacitor power generation system functioning in isolated sites rich in sunshine. The controller should drive the system through its electrical part to satisfy the varying load demand and maintain the state of charge of the supercapacitor at an appropriate level. The system includes a thermodynamic machine (Stirling Engine) that drives a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). An appropriate power electronics is interfaced between this PMSG and the AC load to be supplied with the desired power. In order to meet the load transient demand, a supercapacitor is used and its delivered power is controlled by mean of a bidirectional DC/DC converter. As the testbed is under construction, a simulation scenarios are proposed to assess the efficiency of the proposed control architecture."
1825131,14010,8441,MPC for reducing energy storage requirement of wind power systems,2013,"This paper discusses using the battery energy storage system (BESS) to mitigate wind power intermittency, so that wind power can be dispatchable on an hourly basis like fossil fuel power plants. In particular, model predictive control (MPC) is used to control the charge and discharge of BESS to compensate for wind power forecast errors and minimize operation costs to the wind farm owner. A ramp rate penalty on wind power scheduling is included in the optimization to make the optimal control trajectory smoother, while the performance is kept intact. Numerical simulations with a one-year long wind power dataset show that MPC controller is much more effective in reducing the operation cost to the wind farm owner than the heuristic control algorithm or conventional reserves, in that BESS with a much smaller capacity will be suffice to achieve the same cost reduction."
2095314,14010,8441,On a rate control protocol for networked estimation,2011,"We study congestion control in a communication network that is supporting remote estimation of multiple processes. A stochastic rate control protocol is developed using the network utility maximization (NUM) framework. The decentralized protocol avoids congestion by regulating the transmission probabilities of the sources. The presence of estimation costs poses new challenges; however, for low congestion, the form of rate controller resembles that of the standard TCP rate controller."
2307807,14010,8441,Fuel minimization of a moving vehicle in suburban traffic,2013,In this paper we study how a driver could use traffic light information in order to adapt his speed profile to save fuel.

Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is a useful tool to provide optimizing policies.
1901975,14010,8441,Dynamic modeling and simulation of a drying system with recuperation of the condensate,2013,"The aim of this work is to build a lumped parameter model of a closed loop drying system with recuperation of the condensate to be used in analysis, simulation and control design. The proposed approach is based on an energy-based modeling technique which guarantees the conservation of energy within the system. The whole system involves thermodynamics, air-water interaction with evaporation and condensation and humid air flows dynamics. The proposed model can be used to make a dynamic analysis of the system, to predict some non-measured variables, to make some sensitivity analysis for different parameters, to investigate the best operation point acting on factors affecting the drying quality and power consumption. Some simulation results are presented and compared to experimental results."
1965898,14010,8441,A model-free distributed approach for wind plant control,2013,"By extracting kinetic energy from the wind flow, a wind turbine reduces the wind speed in the wake downstream of the wind turbine rotor. In a wind power plant, this wake effect reduces the power production of downstream turbines. This paper presents a control scheme for optimizing the total power output of a wind power plant by taking into account the wake effect. It is a distributed control scheme in which each wind turbine adapts its control settings based on information that it receives from neighbouring turbines. The total power optimization is performed using gradient-based optimization. The optimization is done in a model-free, data-driven manner, as the gradients are estimated from the past control actions, the measured power response of the turbine itself, and the power response of neighbouring turbines. The time-efficiency of the optimization scheme was improved by exploiting information on the locations of the turbines in the wind plant, and an estimate of the wind direction. The method is tested in a simulation of the Princess Amalia Wind Park. To be able to evaluate the time-efficiency of the scheme, in the simulation model a delay structure was included that models the wake traveling from one turbine to the next. The new control method results in a much faster convergence of the power optimization when compared with an existing model-free wind plant power optimization method that uses a game theoretic approach."
1534531,14010,8441,Adaptive Disturbance Tracking theory with state estimation and state feedback for region II control of large wind turbines,2013,"A theory called Adaptive Disturbance Tracking Control (ADTC) is introduced and used to track the Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) of 5 MW Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT). Since ADTC theory requires wind speed information, a wind disturbance generator model is combined with lower order plant model to estimate the wind speed as well as partial states of the wind turbine. In this paper, we present a proof of stability and convergence of ADTC theory with lower order estimator and show that the state feedback can be adaptive."
2097231,14010,8441,Generalised absolute stability and Sum of Squares,2011,"This paper introduces a general framework for analysing systems that have non-polynomial, uncertain or high order nonlinearities. It decomposes the vector field using Lur'e type feedback into a system with a polynomial or rational vector field and a nonlinear memoryless feedback term, which is bounded by polynomial or rational functions. This decomposition can be used to model uncertainty in the nonlinear term or to bound difficult to analyse nonlinearities by simpler polynomial or rational functions. Conditions for stability are found using Lyapunov functions which are generalisations of those used for the derivation of the multivariable circle and Popov criteria. These conditions can be given in terms of polynomial inequalities and so Sum of Squares techniques can be used to efficiently analyse these systems. An example shows how the techniques can be applied to uncertain coupled genetic circuits and a pendulum, where the nonlinearity is bounded by polynomial functions. The technique is also applied to show global stability of a system in which classical absolute stability is inconclusive."
1666657,14010,8441,Readiness in formation control of multi-robot system,2013,"To analyze the performance of the formation system in response to inputs/disturbances from outside of the formation, we propose the notion of readiness, which describes the initial conditions of the formation in terms of a certain set of input space. A higher readiness means better initial conditions of the system with better performance in maintaining or recovering the original formation shape against the exogenous inputs/disturbances. Optimization method based on calculus of variations is used in the analysis for deriving the optimality conditions. Simulations modeled on both unicycle and car-like robots demonstrate the features and the potential applications of the proposed notion."
2502159,14010,8441,Gain-scheduling control of a cable-driven MRI-compatible robotic platform for intracardiac interventions,2013,"In this paper, we design and implement a gain-scheduling controller for a parallel structure robotic platform (that we name ROBOCATH) developed to be used in intracardiac interventions under beating-heart conditions. The primary mission for this manipulator is to safely steer the cardiac catheters inside the left ventricle to reach any desired target points under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. In this paper, we first derive a reduced-order dynamic model of the robot based on the Lagrange method to capture the nonlinear dynamics of the platform. The model is then used for the design of a state feedback linear parameter varying (LPV) controller to command the robot to position the catheter in any desired state. During the controller design process, appropriate selection of scheduling parameters not only helps hide the nonlinearities of the system dynamics but also leads to a set of decoupled models for the structure, where each degree of freedom could be treated separately. The performance of the controller is compared with a variable-gain proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller designed in our earlier work. The experimental results show that the proposed control scheme has significant advantages in terms of implementation, set point tracking and actuator saturation over the baseline PID controller."
1717561,14010,8441,Sub-optimal control design of a semi-active vibration reduction system,2013,"This paper considers the vibration reduction of transportation systems using semi-active actuators to improve the ride quality. Control design for the resultant semi-active system is difficult for nonlinear dynamics, constrained control, lack of performance-oriented nonlinear control design, and limited state information. A sub-optimal control structure is proposed to address the performance requirement by mimicking the optimal control. A specific sub-optimal control is provided and implemented with one measurement to reduce the hardware cost. Performance analysis of the sub-optimal control is investigated. The semi-active system with the sub-optimal control is simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness."
1592004,14010,8441,A geometric control approach for optimum maneuverability of flapping wing MAVs near hover,2013,"Flapping wing micro-air vehicles are aerial robots that use biomimetic actuation for propulsion and control. Designing such a system requires an integrated system model describing the flight mechanics, propulsion, and control. Relative to conventional aircraft, the resulting model is nonlinear, high-dimensional, time-varying, and underactuated, making analysis and design challenging. Geometric control and averaging theory provide useful analysis tools for biomimetic locomotion systems that use high frequency, time-periodic inputs to generate control forces and moments. Recognizing the essential role of certain Lie bracket and symmetric product vector fields in the flight mechanics of a flapping wing micro-air vehicle, we develop analytical expressions for these vector fields in terms of system parameters. Using these expressions, we then pose and solve a design optimization problem aimed at maximizing vehicle maneuverability. The example illustrates a constructive technique for the design of biomimetic robots and their gaits."

Our goal is to investigate the termination time of these dynamics, which has been investigated for a scalar case, but remained an open question for dimensions higher than one. We provide a polynomial upper bound for the termination time of the dynamics when the connectivity among the agents maintains a certain structure. Our approach is based on the use of an adjoint dynamics for the Hegselmann-Krause model and a Lyapunov comparison function that is defined in terms of the adjoint dynamics."
1845998,14010,8441,Control of dissipative partial differential equation systems using APOD based dynamic observer designs,2013,This article focuses on output feedback control of distributed parameter systems with limited number of sensors employing adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition (APOD) methodology. The controller design issue is addressed by combining a robust state controller with a dynamic observer of the system states to reduce sensor requirements. The use of APOD methodology allows the development of locally accurate low-dimensional reduced order dynamic models (ROMs) for controller synthesis thus resulting in a computationally-efficient alternative to using large-dimensional models with global validity. The derived ROMs are subsequently employed for the design of dynamic observers and controllers. The proposed methods are successfully used to achieve the desired control objective of stabilizing the Kuramoto-Sivashinksy equation (KSE) at a desired state spatial profile.
2444630,14010,8441,Generation of excitation signals with prescribed autocorrelation for input and output constrained systems,2013,"This paper considers the problem of realizing an input signal with a desired autocorrelation sequence satisfying both input and output constraints for the system it is to be applied to. This is a important problem in system identification. Firstly, the properties of the identified model are highly dependent on the used excitation signal during the experiment and secondly, on real processes, due to actuator saturation and safety considerations, it is important to constrain the inputs and outputs of the process. The proposed method is formulated as a nonlinear model predictive control problem. In general this corresponds to solving a non-convex optimization problem. Here we show how this can be solved in one particular case. For this special case convergence is established for generation of pseudo-white noise. The performance of the algorithm is successfully verified by simulations for a few different auto-correlation sequences, with and without input and output constraints."

For that a key performance indicator (KPI) which reflects the economic performance of the system is defined, and the objective of the proposed FTC scheme is to maintain the system KPI in the admissible range in faulty conditions. The basic idea behind this scheme is data-driven design of the proposed fault-tolerant architecture whose core is an observer/residual generator based realization of the Youla parameterization of all stabilizing controllers with an embedded residual generator for fault detection (FD) purpose. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are demonstrated through the wind turbine benchmark model proposed in [1]."
1705940,14010,8441,Observer-based closed-loop control for the glucose-insulin system: Local Input-to-State Stability with respect to unknown meal disturbances,2013,"Closed-loop glucose control schemes, usually based on intravenous/subcutaneous insulin administration, need to cope with the problem of exogenous glucose intake (e.g. a meal), a disturbance hard to anticipate in timing, in amount and in the rate of effective absorption of the nutrient. In this note, an intravenous feedback control law is considered, based on the use of a Delay Differential Equation (DDE) model of the glucose-insulin system, with the external meal treated as a completely unknown disturbance. It is shown that the closed-loop system satisfies the local Input-to-State Stability (ISS) property with respect to the unknown disturbance. The equivalence between asymptotic stability and local input-to-state stability for retarded nonlinear systems is proven. Simulations show the efficacy of the control algorithm with respect to a standard plasma glucose appearance rate profile following a meal, taken from the literature."

The proposed scheme is based on a Fuzzy Gain Scheduling (FGS) technique and an Automatic Signal Correction (ASC) algorithm. The FTC system exploits the fault information from a model-based FDD scheme developed using fuzzy modeling and identification method. The proposed FTC system is evaluated by a series of simulations on the wind turbine benchmark model in the presence of wind turbulences, measurement noises, and different realistic fault scenarios. All results indicate high effectiveness and robustness of the FTC system in both fault-free and faulty operations of the wind turbine."
2567130,14010,8441,Complexity reduction for parameter-dependent linear systems,2013,"We present a complexity reduction algorithm for a family of parameter-dependent linear systems when the system parameters belong to a compact semi-algebraic set. This algorithm potentially describes the underlying dynamical system with fewer parameters or state variables. To do so, it minimizes the distance (i.e., H ∞ -norm of the difference) between the original system and its reduced version. We present a sub-optimal solution to this problem using sum-of-squares optimization methods. We present the results for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. Lastly, we illustrate the applicability of our proposed algorithm on numerical examples."
2338503,14010,8441,Model of a contact lens and tear layer at static equilibrium,2013,"In this paper, we study the static stability of a spherical cap lens and a tear layer. The contact angle of the tear meniscus with the cornea and contact lens may have a range of values due to capillary effect hysteresis. As the lens is in static equilibrium all the forces and moments sum to zero. Capillary effect hysteresis is found to be a beneficial effect aiding the stability of the lens. The forces acting on the lens are its weight, force due to hydrostatic and atmospheric pressures and surface tension on the periphery of the lens due to the tear meniscus. The fixed parameters in the model are weight of the lens, coefficient of surface tension, magnitude of gravitational acceleration, density of the tear liquid and physical parameters of the lens such as the diameter and base curve radius. The adjustable parameters in the model are contact angles of the tear meniscus with the cornea and contact lens respectively and the position of the lens on the cornea. Numerical experiments suggest that there exists a range of values for the adjustable parameters that lead to physically reasonable solutions, for lens position; extent of overlap of the lower lid on the lens; pressure due to the lid on the lens; and the thickness of tear layer between the lens and the cornea."

1147264,14010,11104,Enhanced SMOS amplitude calibration using external target,2012,"The single element antenna patch loss, characterized by an attenuation L 1 , is a key parameter in SMOS data processing. It is used to compute the system temperature for visibility denormalization and the average antenna temperature from the raw NIR measurements. A theoretical estimation of this attenuation was carried out before launch in order to provide a default value, which was set equal to 0.05dB for all antennas. However, from the beginning of the mission it was soon observed that keeping a constant value for L1 resulted in unexpected and un-natural drifts in the processed data. The conclusion is that L 1  does not remain constant and must be periodically estimated in order to introduce refreshed values into the processing."

The eight upstream riparian nations, Ethiopia, Eretria, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo, Tanzania and Kenya are the source of approximately 86% of the water inputs to the Nile, while the two downstream riparian countries Sudan and Egypt, presently rely on the river's flow for most of the their needs. Both climate and agriculture contribute to the complicated nature of Nile River management: precipitation in the headwaters regions of Ethiopia and Lake Victoria is variable on a seasonal and inter-annual basis, while demand for irrigation water in the arid downstream region is consistently high. The Nile is, perhaps, one of the most difficult trans-boundary water issue in the world 1 , and this study would be the first initiative to combine NASA satellite observations with the hydrologic models study the overall water balance in a comprehensive manner. The cornerstone application of NASA's Earth Science Research Results under this project are the NASA Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) 2  and the USDA Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) 3  model. The end-users such as Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD, Nairobi, Kenya), Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office (ENTRO, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), Ethiopian and Kenya Meteorological and Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNet) will be the eventual benefactors of this work."
2520098,14010,11104,Development of rice photosynthesis model for monitoring yields and carbon sequestration using multi-satellite data,2011,The forth IPCC report pointed out grain production as one of the highest vulnerability by which climate change is expected to impart the most severe effects. The recent concern about food scarcity motivates the development of the present system named Remote Sensing Environmental Monitor (RSEM) for crop yield monitoring. The authors have developed a photosynthesis model for rice production to address such issues. The system includes a photosynthetic sterility yield model using meteorological re-analysis data and precise land use and cover (LULC) classification of crop field in Asian countries. The validation concept is based on the fact that the carbon hydrate in grains has the same chemical formula as cellulose in grain vegetation. The both photosynthesis and sterility models are validated by carbon partitioning method associated with particular rice species in Japan and China.
2311242,14010,8441,Control-based high-speed direct mask fabrication for lithography via mechanical plowing,2013,"Mechanical indentation and plowing is one of the most widely used methods in AFM nanolithography. Compared to other probe-based AFM nanolithography techniques such as the Dip-pen and the milliped, mechanical plowing is not restrictive to conductive materials and/or soft materials. However, like other probe-based nanolithgraphy techniques, the low-throughput has hindered the implementation of this technique in practices. In this paper, a recently-developed iterative learning control technique is utilized to account for the adverse effects encountered in high-speed, large-range mechanical plowing nanolithography, including the hysteresis, the vibrational dynamics, and the cross-axis dynamics-coupling effects. This approach is implemented to directly fabricate patterns on a mask consisting of a nickel layer sandwiched between an aluminum layer on the top and a silicon dioxide substrate on the bottom. The experimental results demonstrated that a relatively large-size pattern of four grooves (20 μm in length) can be fabricated at a high-speed of ~3.8 mm/sec, with the line width and line depth at ~80 nm and 5 nm, respectively."

Two periods data with fifteen years interval were analyzed. Land cover classification about 600m by 600m size was analyzed at 225 weather observation points. At 145 points of the 225 points, there was no change about land cover. At 22 points, land cover tended widely to urbanize. At non-changed points, the average inclination of temperature was 0.052 degrees Celsius per year, and at urbanized points, the average inclination of temperature was 0.067 degrees Celsius per year. The relation between temperature inclination and urbanized index UI and normalized vegetation index NDVI was also analyzed. There is correlation with temperature inclination and UI and NDVI."

2079827,14010,8441,Rapid Flight Control Prototyping - Steps toward cooperative mission-oriented capabilities,2013,"The paper describes the latest advancements in the development of the Rapid Flight Control Prototyping system that were motivated primarily by the need to enable cooperative missions of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles and to enhance the capabilities of human operators to design and oversee the collaborative behaviors of multiple heterogeneous UAVs. The evolution of the system is driven by the mission level objectives and supported on one hand by the progress in miniature sensors, computational power, communication and portable energy technologies and on the other hand by the advanced capabilities of embedded control and communication-oriented software.

2505820,14010,8441,Model-based personalization scheme of an artificial pancreas for Type 1 diabetes applications,2013,"Automated controllers designed to regulate blood glucose concentrations in people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) must avoid hypoglycemia (blood glucose  180 mg/dl), a challenging task. In this paper, a model-based control design approach with a personalized scheme based on readily available clinical factors is applied to a linearized control-relevant model of subject insulin-glucose response profiles. An insulin feedback strategy is included with specific personalization settings and variations in a tuning parameter, τ c . The control strategy is challenged by an unannounced meal disturbance with 50 g carbohydrate content. A set of metrics are introduced as a method of evaluating the performance of different controllers. In-silico simulations of ten subjects in the Food and Drug Administration accepted Universities of Virginia and Padova metabolic simulator indicate that the personalization strategy with a τ c  setting of 270 minutes gives very good controller performance. Post-prandial glucose concentration peaks of 183 mg/dl were achieved with 97% of the total simulation time spent within a safe glycemic zone (70-180 mg/dl), without hypoglycemic incidents and without requiring a time-consuming model identification process."
2930940,14010,8441,Observer-based feedback control for stabilization of collective motion,2011,Collective motion of a multi-vehicle testbed has applications in weather monitoring and ocean sampling. Previous work in this field has produced theoretically justified algorithms for stabilization of parallel and circular motions of self-propelled particles using measurements of relative position and relative velocity. This paper describes an observer-based feedback algorithm for stabilization of parallel and circular motions using measurements of relative position only. This algorithm utilizes information about the particle dynamics and turning rates to estimate the relative velocities. We describe a laboratory-scale underwater vehicle testbed on which the algorithm is being implemented.

The analysis relies on logarithmic transformations of the value functions and the use of linearly solvable Partial Differential Equations(PDEs). We derive the corresponding optimal control as a function of the δ-sensitivity of the logarithmic transformation of the value function for the case of nonlinear diffusion processes affine in control and noise.
1531918,14010,8228,Contractive interference functions and rates of convergence of distributed power control laws,2012,"The standard interference functions introduced by Yates have been very influential on the analysis and design of distributed power control laws. While powerful and versatile, the framework has some drawbacks: the existence of fixed-points has to be established separately, and no guarantees are given on the rate of convergence of the iterates. This paper introduces contractive interference functions, a slight reformulation of the standard interference functions that guarantees existence and uniqueness of fixed-points and geometric convergence rates. We show that many power control laws from the literature are contractive and derive, sometimes for the first time, convergence rate estimates for these algorithms. Finally, we show that although standard interference functions are not contractive, they are paracontractions with respect to a certain metric space. Extensions to two-sided scalable interference functions are also discussed."

The Green's function is first used in control design to construct a test function that guarantees the solvability of a map between the original nonhomogeneous partial differential equation and a target system in a standard boundary control form. Then the regularized Green's function is employed in motion planning, leading to a computationally traceable implementation of the control scheme combined by a single feedback stabilizing loop and feedforward controls. The viability and the applicability of the proposed approach are demonstrated through numerical simulations of a representative microbeam."

728433,14010,11104,Urban land cover mapping with TerraSAR-X using an edge-aware region-growing and merging algorithm,2014,"The objective of this licentiate thesis is to develop novel algorithms and improve existing methods for urban land cover mapping and urban extent extraction using multi-temporal remote sensing imagery. Past studies have demonstrated that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) have very good properties for the analysis of urban areas, the synergy of SAR and optical data is advantageous for various applications. The specific objectives of this research are:1. To develop a novel edge-aware region-growing and -merging algorithm, KTH-SEG, for effective segmentation of SAR and optical data for urban land cover mapping;2. To evaluate the synergistic effects of multi-temporal ENVISAT ASAR and HJ-1B multi-spectral data for urban land cover mapping;3. To improve the robustness of an existing method for urban extent extraction by adding effective pre- and post-processing.ENVISAT ASAR data and the Chinese HJ-1B multispectral , as well as TerraSAR-X data were used in this research. For objectives 1 and 2 two main study areas were chosen, Beijing and Shanghai, China. For both sites a number of multitemporal ENVISAT ASAR (30m C-band) scenes with varying image characteristics were selected during the vegetated season of 2009. For Shanghai TerraSAR-X strip-map images at 3m resolution X-band) were acquired for a similar period in 2010 to also evaluate high resolution X-band SAR for urban land cover mapping. Ten major landcover classes were extracted including high density built-up, low density built-up, bare field, low vegetation, forest, golf course, grass, water, airport runway and major road.For Objective 3, eleven globally distributed study areas where chosen, Berlin, Beijing, Jakarta, Lagos, Lombardia (northern Italy), Mexico City, Mumbai, New York City, Rio de Janeiro, Stockholm and Sydney. For all cities ENVISAT ASAR imagery was acquired and for cities in or close to mountains even SRTM digital elevation data.The methodology of this thesis includes two major components, KTH-SEG and KTH-Pavia Urban Extractor. KTH-SEG is an edge aware region-growing and -merging algorithm that utilizes both the benefit of finding local high frequency changes as well as determining robustly homogeneous areas of a low frequency in local change. The post-segmentation classification is performed using support vector machines. KTH-SEG was evaluated using multitemporal, multi-angle, dual-polarization ASAR data and multispectral HJ-1B data as well as TerraSAR-X data. The KTH-Pavia urban extractor is a processing chain. It includes: Geometrical corrections, contrast enhancement, builtup area extraction using spatial stastistics and GLCM texture features, logical operator based fusion and DEM based mountain masking.For urban land cover classification using multitemporal ENVISAT ASAR data, the results showed that KTH-SEG achieved an overall accuracy of almost 80% (0.77 Kappa ) for the 10 urban land cover classes both Beijign and Shanghai, compared to eCognition results of 75% (0.71 Kappa) In particular the detection of small linear features with respect to the image resolution such as roads in 30m resolved data went well with 83% user accuracy from KTH-SEG versus 57% user accuracy using the segments derived from eCognition. The other urban classes which in particular in SAR imagery are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity were classified superiorly by KTH-SEG. ECognition in general performed better on vegetation classes such as grass, low vegetation and forest which are usually more homogeneous.It is was also found that the combination of ASAR and HJ-1B optical data was beneficial, increasing the final classification accuracy by at least 10% compared to ASAR or HJ-1B data alone. The results also further confirmed that a higher diversity of SAR type images is more important for the urban classification outcome. However, this is not the case when classifying high resolution TerraSAR-X strip-map imagery. Here the different image characteristics of different look angles, and orbit orientation created more confusion mainly due to the different layover and foreshortening effects on larger buildings. The TerraSAR-X results showed also that accurate urban classification can be achieved using high resolution SAR data alone with almost 84% for eight classes around the Shanghai international Airport (high and low density built-up were not separated as well as roads and runways).For urban extent extraction, the results demonstrated that built-up areas can be effectively extracted using a single ENVISAT ASAR image in 10 global cities reaching overall accuracies around 85%, compared to 75% of MODIS urban class and 73% GlobCover Urban class. Multitemporal ASAR can improve the urban extraction results by 5-10% in Beijing. Mountain masking applied in Mumbai and Rio de Janeiro increased the accuracy by 3-5%.The research performed in this thesis has contributed to the remote sensing community by providing algorithms and methods for both extracting urban areas and identifying urban land cover in a more detailed fashion."

In order to enhance biophysical and biochemical properties of canopy species, a set of vegetation indices were computed. These indices served as input for a region growing segmentat ion algorithm that takes into account mutual similarity of pixels and spectral separability between neighbor segments. Segmentation output was evaluat ed on the basis of a score computed with the proportion of the area of the segments located within manuall y delineated ITCs . Results show that the segmentation approach is able to automatically delineate up to 70% of the control ITCs. Index Terms ± Brazilian Atlantic Forest , image segmentation, individual tree crowns, forest management, deciduous tree species 1. INTRODUCTION Hyperspectral remote ly sens ed data provide important information for management and conservation of tropical forests. In this context , research ha s been developed on tree species discrimination at both leaf - and canopy -levels [1 ]-[3] . At the canopy -level, due to unique spectral signatures of tree species , the focus has been on pixel -based classification approaches. However, studies performed at the individual tree crow n (ITC) level had reported higher classification accuracies [1 ],[2],[4]. ITC s are often manually delineated using high spatial resolution images [1] , since tree crow ns, particularly from emergent species , are easily distinguishable. Although this method produces satisfactory results , it is labor intensive and therefore unfeasi ble over large areas. A utomatic ITC delineation in tropical forests is a challenging task because of the vegetation stands structure . Trees have often no n-uniform heights and overlapping crowns, which makes the distinction of clear boundaries between individuals very difficult, even in sub -meter resolution images. Moreover, effects of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) caused by crown architecture , view and illumination ang les lead to different proportions of shaded and illumin ated pixels within the same ITC. Nevertheless, the information present in hyperspectral images can be exploited to reduce such effects , and enhance spectral features contributing to an improved ITC delineation. In this work, we propose a method for automatic delineation of tree crowns, in a tropical forest area, using a region growing segmentation algorithm designed specifically for this task . The h igh dimensionality of hyperspectral data was reduced into a set of vegetation indices (VI) to enhance b iophysical and biochemical features of semi -deciduous tree species. The segmentation algorithm took into account, through a spectral separability measure between segments, the contribution of VIs on the automatic ITC delineation process. 2.

786292,14010,11104,Assessment of satellite based vegetation land surface phenology algorithms with application to a 20 year NOAA AVHRR record over Canada and Northern USA.,2014,"ABSTRACT Land Surface phenology (LSP) is related to vegetation dynamics and is an indicator of tracking surface climate change. One of the challenges in the study of LSP is the validation of satellite based LSP products . Here, we have proposed a novel methodology of the validating LSP products by applying observed temporal gap and measurement noise to representative daily NDVI reference time series from satellite imagery . Three well -known LSP algorithms (iterative Savitzky -Golay filtering - SGF [1], Asymmetric Gaussian Fitting ± AGF [2] and Logistic fitting [3, 4]) are applied to 20 years of NOAA AVHRR mea surements over biomes in Canada and Northern USA . For a given AVHRR cloud threshold, both AGF and SGF are more sensitive to the amount of gaps than to the noise in the data. Index Terms ² time seri es, phenology, comparison, validation 1. INTRODUCTION Land Surface phenology (LSP) involves the study of seasonal pattern of variation in vegetated land surfaces from remote sensing obser vations [5]. LSP is related to vegetation phenology ± the study of the timings of recurrent plant cycle events that are driven by environmental factors [6], and to changes in surface climate. Due to its significance, many attempts have been made, over the years , to produce satellite based LSP products. The Committee of Earth Observation systems (CEOS) Working Group on Calibrat ion and Validation Land Surface Phenology indicators documents a large number ( >15) of LSP products derived through the application of different algorithms to satellite measurement time series [7]. Validation of LSP algorithms is challenging d ue to differences in : i) user requirements, ii) in-situ survey methods and quantities, iii) phenology metrics iv) spatial and temporal sampling of reference measurem ents etc. Validation studies can be broadly classified into those that compare satellite based LSP with in -situ measurements [8-11 ] and those that compare satellite LSP to reference estimates derived from the same or similar satellite datasets [12 -16 ]. We focus here on the latter. Hir d and McDermid [12 ] evaluated six LSP methods over selected biomes in West -Central Alberta, Canada for their sensitivity to the amount noise. Th ey created biome specific reference sa tellite phenology time series (REF) by averaging cloud free daily MODIS NDVI time series over ~100 pixels within a biome qualitatively judged to share a similar temporal profile . Phenology estimates , derived by applying thresholds to noisy NDVI time series over a member pixel based on a selected algorithm , were compared to the same processing applied to REF . Their stu dy introduced the concept of creating a reference noise free time series from the same observations used for LSP estimat ion . Howeve r, the ir approach has limitations : i) subjective criterion for selecting inputs to reference profiles limits its usage in a global perspective , ii) noisy profiles used for validation may be biased compared to the reference , and iii) limited control on the joint pattern of gaps and noise. Kandasamy, et al. [16 ] used an ensemble of smoothers , rather than the daily average used in [12], to create a REF within a sampled biome. This approach has advantages in comparison to [12] : i) REF is less likely to be biased to a single smoother , ii) REF can be constructed even if gaps are present in the data used to create it , and iii) actual gap profiles can be applied when generating noisy measurements . They evaluated 8 candidate methods by selecting gaps from other cloud screened time series in the same biome. H owever, the no ise magnitude of the remai ning measurements was held constant. This study proposes a nove l methodology , based on [12 , 16 ] for r ealistic noise and gap simulation for validation of satellite LSP . The approach is applied to a 20 year NOAA AVHRR NDVI times series over Canada and northern USA to quantitatively evalu ate 3 well -known LSP algorithms namely, the Asymmetric Gaussian Fitting - AGF [2], Logistic Fitting - Logistic [3, 4] and iterative Savitzky -Golay filtering - SGF [1]. 2.

With continuous dedicated effort, it is exp ected that most of the sensor calibration parameters will continue to meet their design requirements and th at high quality data products will be continuously generated and used by the operational as well as research community . Index Terms ± VIIRS, S -NPP, SDR , Calibration , VCST 1. INTRODUCTION The first Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) has successfully operated for more than two years since its launch on -board the Suomi -National Polar -orbiting Partnership (S -NPP) spacecraft. The VIIRS has 22 spectral bands: 16 moderate resolutio n bands (M1 -M16 ; 750 m at nadir ) that are primarily used for radiometric observations, 5 imagery bands (I1 -I5 ; 375 m at nadir), and 1 day/night band (DNB) of 750 m nadir resolution . M1 -M11, I1 -I3, and DNB are the reflective solar bands (RSB) covering wavel engths from 0.41 to 2.3 P m. M12 -M16 and I4 -I5 are the thermal emissive bands (TEB) covering wavelengths from 3.7 to 12 P m. 7 of the 22 spectral bands; M1 -M5, M7, and M13 are the dual gain bands, enabling observations to be made over a large dynamic range. VIIRS on -orbit calibration is provided by a set of on -board calibrators (OBC) designed with a strong MODIS heritage , which include a solar diffuser (SD), a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM), and a blackbody (BB) as shown in Figure 1. Since launch, th e NASA VIIRS Characterization Support Team (VCST), in support of the S -NPP mission operation team (MOT), has scheduled and carried out a broad range of VIIRS radiometric and geometric calibration activities, which have led to the generation of consistent c alibrat ion look -up tables (LUT) for improved Sensor Data Records (SDR) production. This effort has significantly contributed to the VIIRS SDR as well as the Environmental Data Records (EDR) quality assessment and validation. This paper provides an overview of VIIRS calibration and characterization activities performed since its launch and an update to its on -orbit performance. Results derived from the sensor OBC and lunar observati ons are illustrated. C halleng ing issues and potential improvements for VIIRS SDR calibration and data quality are also briefly discussed."
2481007,14010,11104,Application of KLIMA/G-POD algorithm to CO 2 retrieval from IASI/METOP-A observations and comparison with GOSAT/TANSO-FTS products,2012,"The ESA research project “Application of KLIMA algorithm to CO 2  retrieval from IASI/METOP-A observations and comparison with GOSAT/TANSO-FTS products” aims at the develop of a dedicated software, based on the KLIMA inversion algorithm (originally proposed by IFAC-CNR for the ESA Earth Explorer Mission), optimally suited for CO 2  retrieval and integrated into the ESA GRID-based operational environment G-POD (Grid Processing On-Demand) to processing Level-1 data acquired by the IASI instrument onboard the METOP-A satellite and to perform a comparison and cross-validation of GOSAT TANSO-FTS Level-2 data. Optimized versions of the KLIMA-IASI code have been investigated, aiming at developing a non-operation retrieval code with capabilities that meet the requirements of cross validation with GOSAT TANSO-FTS products and with adequate features for the integration on the G-POD system. The KLIMA algorithm consists of two distinct modules: the Forward Model and the Retrieval Model, optimized for inverse processing of IASI measurements. The Forward Model is a line-by-line radiative transfer model, with capability to simulate wideband spectral radiances acquired by IASI. The adopted spectroscopic database is HITRAN 2008. Dedicated spectroscopic database and line shape are implemented for CO 2 , to take into account the line-mixing effect (Niro et al., 2005). The Retrieval Model uses a constrained Nonlinear Least Square Fit approach and the cost function to be minimized takes into account the a priori information (Optimal Estimation Method) and the Marquardt parameter. To reduce the impact of systematic uncertainties, this module implements a multi-target retrieval (more than one species is simultaneously retrieved) and a complete variance-covariance matrix (VCM), including both the measurement errors and the errors in the estimate of FM parameters. For the performance of the retrieval a target accuracy of 0.3% (1 ppmv out of 370 ppmv) on regional scales (1000 × 1000 km) at monthly intervals, which is consistent with the requirements of the GOSAT mission for CO 2  products, was assumed as reference value. The required maximum program size was set to one Gbyte and the running time was limited with the aim of processing one orbit of IASI data in one day when using G-POD computing resources. The KLIMA-IASI ARM algorithm has been successfully integrated in the ESA G-POD for Earth Observation Application and now the code is available to all interested users for bulk processing of IASI data. ESA G-POD is a GRID based-operational environment, accessible using a dedicated Web portal (http://gpod.eo.esa.int/). It hosts more than 350 local computing nodes, more than 500 TB of EO data coming from ESA and non-ESA satellites. The full capacity of G-POD computing resources, that can be made available for KLIMA-IASI bulk processing, are currently under evaluation; moreover the upload of the full set of IASI data acquired in one year (march 2010 - march 2011) shall be completed (3 months are available at the moment). After the procurement of a consolidated version of the KLIMA-IASI/G- POD retrieval code it was possible to start the processing of IASI spectra and for comparison and cross-validation of KLIMA-IASI CO 2  products with GOSAT/TANSO-FTS operational products. Using the KLIMA inversion code integrated into the ESA G-POD, it was possible to perform an extensive inter-comparison and cross-validation of a selected set of IASI measurements collocated with GOSAT TANSO-FTS observations. The KLIMA-IASI code was used for the retrieval of CO 2  total column from a series of test cases for comparison with GOSAT TANSO-FTS SWIR L2 data. Retrieved values from measurements acquired by the two instruments in February 2011 in two selected areas between 25–45°N over Nord America and Asia are shown in figures 1–2, along with maps of the footprints of IASI (red crosses) and GOSAT (green crosses) Field of Views."
2383052,14010,8441,Introduction to wide-area control of power systems,2013,"A key element in the development of smart power transmission systems over the past decade is the tremendous advancement of the Wide-Area Measurement System (WAMS) technology, also commonly referred to as the Synchrophasor technology. Sophisticated digital recording devices called Phasor Measurement Units or PMUs are currently being installed at different points in the North American grid, especially under the smart grid initiatives of the US Department of Energy, to record and communicate GPS-synchronized, high sampling rate (6-60 samples/sec), dynamic power system data. Significant research efforts have been made on techniques to useWAMS for monitoring and situational awareness of large power networks dispersed across wide geographical areas. In contrast, use of WAMS for automatic feedback control has received less attention from the research community. The objective of this paper is to bridge this gap by formulating wide-area control problems for oscillation damping, voltage control, wide-area protection, and disturbance localization. We present the main research challenges that need to be overcome to realize the benefits of wide area control in power systems. Our discussion begins with a review of the fundamental physical models of different characteristic components of a large transmission-level power grid such as synchronous generators, transmission lines, and loads, followed by a description of how these subsystem-level models can be integrated to form the overall system model. We pose ten distinct control-theoretic problems. The first two problems are on using PMU measurements from selected nodes in the system to identify such system models in different resolutions in real-time, and the remaining on how the identified models can be used for designing output-feedback based damping controllers, for understanding voltage fluctuations at different nodes of the network graph, and for detecting malicious inputs entering the system dynamics via faults or extraneous attacks. We also propose two new control paradigms, namely a scheduling approach for appropriate controller selection based on online estimation of oscillation modes, and distributed phasor-based control using model estimation. We illustrate our ideas via representative examples, many of which are inspired by well-known power transfer paths in the US west coast grid, also referred to as the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC)."
1451542,14010,21102,Cooperative and hierarchical fuzzy MPC for building heating control,2014,"A combined cooperative and hierarchical control structure utilizing Fuzzy Model Predictive Control (FMPC) for building heating is introduced. The structure comprises three types of Model Predictive Controllers (MPC): For different independent zones of the building FMPCs optimize the fast acting input variable fan coils (FC) while a global linear MPC optimizes the slowly acting thermally activated building systems (TABS). Cooperation between these two groups of controllers is guaranteed by an inter-sample iteration. This cooperative structure acts as master in a hierarchical structure, where the slave is a mixed-inter MPC (MI-MPC) in the supply level. While the cooperative structure ensures user comfort in the building, the MI-MPC optimizes monetary costs of heat supply. This structure allows for decoupled and independent modeling of FMPCs, simple incorporation of the coupling input TABS, and decoupled design of the supply level control. A discussion on stability and sub-optimality of the control structure is given. A simulation of a large office building incorporating disturbances of ambient temperature, radiance, and occupancy demonstrates the performance of the proposed concept. Index Terms— fuzzy MPC; TS-fuzzy system modelling; build- ing climate control; cooperative MPC; hierachical MPC. I. INTRODUCTION The application of standard control designs to large non- linear complex processes requires specific modeling tech- niques. One possible approach presented here is the division into smaller locally linear sub-processes with Fuzzy model- ing. This allows for application of linear control structures, and moreover, individual local sub-processes can be added or removed without affecting the model or controller parameters of the other sub-processes. However, if there exist inputs acting simultaneously on all sub-processes, the individual local linear models are no longer decoupled. In order to ac- tively compensate these input couplings an additional global controller is proposed. All controllers are chosen as Model Based Predictive Controllers (MPC), as it is an effective way to handle measurable or predictable disturbances, large numbers of inputs and outputs, and to cope with constraints, (4). The resulting control scheme is a hierarchical and coopera- tive Fuzzy MPC (FMPC) structure which enables a modular control design. Parallel FMPCs, one for each sub-process, optimize their specific output by considering the output of the global MPC as a known disturbance. The global MPC op- timizes only the coupling inputs based on a simplified global model and the known disturbances of all FMPC-inputs. The"

Worldview-2 offers an increased number of spectral bands for high-resolution image, from the traditional 4bands to 8 bands. It boasts of the ability to enhance mapping and monitoring of benthic habitats with the addition of the Coastal Band. This was investigated in this research using a Worldview-2 image of Bolinao, Pangasinan acquired on March 2010. The study site, Bolinao, has the highest single concentration of seagrass in the northern part of the Philippines. To achieve more accurate results, geometric, atmospheric and water column corrections were applied to the images. For geometric correction, a Differential Global Positioning System Topcon Hiper Ga model receiver was used to obtain highly accurate ground control points. Atmospheric correction was performed in ENVI using the Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis (FLAASH) model. Three water column correction models were applied and compared in this research, Lyzenga's Optical Model, Stumpf's Ratio Model and Simple Radiative Transfer Model. A spectral library was created using in situ reflected spectral radiances on both submerged and emerged vegetation to aid in image classification. Different benthic covers, seagrass, sand, corals and rocks are significantly separable spectrally based on spectral signatures obtained on field using a USB 4000 Fiber Optic Spectrometer. Maximum likelihood supervised classification in ENVI 4.8 is utilized for mapping. Using Worldview 2's coastal, green, yellow and red bands and applying the Simple Radiative Transfer Model produced the highest overall accuracy (88.3%) among the classification results. Using the same bands, Stumpf's Ratio Model produced 87.84% overall accuracy while Lyzenga's optical model achieved 75.54%. Moran's I spatial autocorrelation was implemented to increase the classification accuracy. Using lag 1 slightly increased Stumpf's Model's overall accuracy, from 87.84% to 88.08% while using lags 5 and 10 decreased the overall accuracy with 83.91% and 84.25% respectively."
887226,14010,9475,Tracking control of direct-drive servos,2011,"Multi-objective optimization, data-intensive analysis and hardware-software co-design are the major challenging themes in the concurrent design of high-performance electromechanical systems. Direct-drive servos guarantee superior torque and force densities, efficiency, robustness, simplicity and other enabling performance quantities. Nano-, micro-, mini- and macro-scale axial and radial actuators exist in a great variety, e.g., from living organisms to various engineered electromechanical systems. Permanent-magnet actuators and servos are widely used in aerospace, automotive, biotechnology, energy, medical, power, robotic and other applications. The major goal of this paper is to report and apply advanced concepts in design and implementation of tracking control laws. These control laws are designed using the state transformation method applying the Hamilton-Jacobi optimization and Lyapunov stability theory. We design and evaluate high-performance drives and servos. Various servo-systems with radial- and axial-topology actuators are demonstrated and characterized by evaluating analog and digital tracking control laws. The studied direct-drive actuators with SmCo permanent-magnet arrays guarantee high toque density, high efficiency, reliability, fast dynamics, etc. The controllers designed guarantee stability, high precision and robustness. The high-frequency PWM drivers vary the voltage applied by changing the duty ratio of FETs. High-accuracy sensors measure angular velocity and displacement. Linear and nonlinear analog control laws guarantee superior performance, enabling capabilities, minimal complexity, simplicity, noise immunity, etc. The analog control laws can be discretized and implemented using microcontrollers and DSPs. The studied drives and servos are applicable in many applications, including hard drives, high-precision pointing systems, rotating tables, manipulators, etc. This paper examines and solves a spectrum of pertinent problems in design and implementation of enabling minimal-complexity control laws and controllers which guarantee near-optimal system performance"
2012939,14010,11104,The Dallas Fort Worth urban remote sensing network,2012,"The Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) and the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) are embarking on a five-year, project to create the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) Urban Demonstration Network. The goals of the program are: 1) To develop high-resolution, three-dimensional mapping of the atmospheric conditions, focusing on the boundary layer, to detect and forecast severe wind, tornado, hail, ice, and flash flood hazards. 2) To create impacts-based, neighborhood-scale warnings and forecasts for a range of public and private decision-makers that result in measureable benefit for public safety and the economy. 3) To demonstrate the value of collaborative, adaptive X-band radar networks to existing and future National Weather Service sensors, products, performance metrics, and decision-making; and assess optimal combinations of observing systems The centerpiece of the Dallas Fort Worth Urban Demonstration Network will be an 8-node, boundary-layer, dual polarized, multi-Doppler X-band CASA radar network. Additional in-situ and remote sensors will enable fusion of observations from all sensors. Data products will include single and multi-radar data, vector wind, Quantitative precipitation estimation, nowcasting, and analysis and numerical weather prediction products. Research and Research to operations in the DFW Urban Demonstration Network will occur in a quasi-operational environment. New technology and products will be integrated into operational platforms for evaluation by a variety of users during real-time weather events. Users include NWS forecasters and emergency managers; users from transportation, utilities, regional airports, arenas, and the media will be added in the near future. In this way, CASA's multidisciplinary team - engineers, computer scientists, social scientists (sociologists, geographer, economist), meteorologists, hydrologists - will conduct “end-to-end” research from sensor observation, to product development and validation linked to end user decision-making, response and value."
649488,14010,23735,Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicle: Modeling and simulation,2014,"The complete modeling and simulation of an unmanned vehicle with combined aerial and underwater ca- pabilities, called Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicle (HUAUV), is presented in this paper. The best architecture for this kind of vehicle was evaluated based on the adaptation of typical platforms for aerial and underwater vehicles, to allow the navigation in both environments. The model selected was based on a quadrotor-like aerial platform, adapted to dive and move underwater. Kinematic and dynamic models are presented here, and the parameters for a small dimension prototype was estimated and simulated. Finally, controllers were used and validated in realistic simulation, including air and water navigation, and the environment transition problem. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first vehicle that is able to navigate in both environment without mechanical adaptation during the medium transitions. I. INTRODUCTION Nowadays, unmanned autonomous vehicles have been the focus of many development efforts, with a large range of applications. The amount of resources applied has improved their capabilities, especially in the military field. Remotely operated or autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), for example, were used in recent military operations around the world (1). But they were also used in non-military activities, like agriculture (2) and surveillance (3). Another important robotic platform are the Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), whose the most known are the Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). This kind of vehicles can also be applied in several commercial field operations (4), e.g. oil and gas extraction in ultra deep waters (5). Both kind of vehicles are well adapted to work in their own environment (air and water, respectively), but some situations may require a single vehicle capable of working in both environment. Such requirement commonly appears when is necessary to perform maintenance on partially or fully submersing structures, as ship hull or risers. A typical approach includes using auxiliary vessels to transport ROVs that will make the inspection of offshore target regions. This problem is harder in partially submersed structures. In such situations, where the usage of auxiliary ships is difficult and expensive, underwater robots equipped with wheels or tracks are recommended."
1136051,14010,11104,Overview Of Sentinel-2,2012,"GMES is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) to provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design towards a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the MSI with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10 m to 60 m depending on the spectral band with a 290 km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and large spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime (extendable to 12 years) over a 20-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen by mid-2014. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same sun synchronous orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five days at the equator."
823942,14010,8441,Identification of linear parameter-varying engine models,2013,"The real-time identification and monitoring of automotive engines has posed many challenging problems. The difficulties are mainly due to the nonlinearity of the engine dynamics due to changes in the engine operating conditions. Various recent studies have demonstrated that many of the powertrain subsystems are well approximated as linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems that are described as time-invariant linear systems with feedback multiplied by operating condition dependent parameters that can be measured or otherwise obtained in real time. The LPV structure has linear dynamics at a fixed operating condition, and has been shown to incorporate much of the known governing laws of physics directly into the structure of the dynamic model. Previously available LPV system identification methods are problematic, being iterative or involving an exponentially growing number of terms that can result in low accuracy models. A recently developed subspace method [Larimore(2013a)] avoids these difficulties giving efficient solutions on larger scale problems using well understood linear time-invariant subspace methods. An added benefit is the rigorous determination of the state order of the process that can be valuable for controller implementation. The identification of engine subsystem models in LPV form has the advantages of greatly improved accuracy, greatly reduced data requirements, and dramatic abilities to extrapolate to conditions not contained in the model fitting data. Use of accurate LPV models in other fields has led to the design of global controllers having guaranteed global stability and margin with improved performance, and monitoring methods to detect changes and faults under operating conditions not previously encountered. Potential issues are significant non-linearities of some engine models that may require the use of recently developed Quasi-LPV subspace methods. Also, to achieve the potential high identification accuracy may require the use of quadruple precision computation for SVD of very large matrices, that is starting to be practical for real-time engine model identification."
1001057,14010,11104,Critical assessment of the historical development of radar polarization technology towards radar polarimetry culminating in fully polarimetric-interferometric SAR,2012,"In this historical assessment of the development from polarization radar systems technology towards fully polarimetric POL-SAR airborne, high-altitude drones and satellite sensors, the at times slow and stepwise advances in step with -polarization device manufacture are critically analyzed. The main contributions from Kennaugh's fundamental polarization radar optimal null postulates of 1952 and its verification by Poelman in the 1970'ies with the first full polarimetric radar at SHAPE-TC will be highlighted, resulting with the chance discovery of Huynen's dissertation of 1970 in a thorough re-assessment of optimal polarization theory derived from Sinclair's scattering matrix formulation. With the introduction of the correct transformation matrix operators by Kostinski & Boerner 1982 for polarization basis transformation plus proper reduction of the 4×4 to the 3×3 reduced covariance and coherency matrices by Lueneburg & Boerner of the 1980'ies, it was possible to derive novel covariance matrix decomposition theories either based on physical reasoning by Durden & Freeman or on optimal eigenvalue theories by Cloude & Pottier during the 1990'ies. Hand in hand with digital SAR processing advances, polarimetric SAR systems technology enjoyed successful airborne (AIR-SAR, E-SAR, Convair-580 & PI-SAR) of the 1990ies, shuttle (SIR-C/XSAR) 1994, and satellite (ALOS-PALSAR, RADARSAT-II & Terra-SAR-X) verification of the past ten years, resulting in the first tandem satellite formation of TanDEM-X 2010. Although various incomplete dual-pol and compact-pol SAR implementations were and are still being pursued, the irreversible quest for fully polarimetric POL-IN-SAR decomposition theories of Yamaguchi with its verification by multi-band airborne, high-altitude drones and satellite sensors is highlighted. The succinct overview will be concluded with a comprehensive assessment of its plethora of steadily increasing applications including next to polar also equatorially orbiting tandem POL-IN-SAR sensors."
1498552,14010,11104,Land use and land cover monitoring with multitemporal and multipolarization Radarsat data: Application to an intensive agricultural area (France),2014,"Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC) represent a key factor for a sustainable development. These ones, in modifying earth-atmosphere interactions contribute to the global change (climate change, desertification, deforestation, water pollution, etc.). Among LULCC, those linked to agriculture activity which necessitates almost 85% of water resource at a world scale appears to be as the main source of greenhouse gas emission [1]. Intensive agriculture model is since several decades the object of numerous debates at the world scale [2], calling for a change of his production model because of its negative effects, in particular at an environmental and sanitary level (water pollution, soil erosion, biodiversity reduction…). But for a sustainable agriculture development, able to feed near 9 billion of persons in 2050, scientific community needs first a better understanding of LULC dynamics. In this context, a fine characterization of the spatiotemporal LULCC is first required, based generally with remote sensing data processing. Nevertheless, with optical data a fine LULC characterization is not easy because of the high occurrence of cloudy conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors, which record images that allow characterizations of terrestrial surfaces despite cloudy climate, offer interesting potentialities for monitoring this type of land use. They are the only one sensors which provide systematic data acquisition and now, their high spatial and temporal resolution offer numerous advantages for a better land cover extraction and characterisation in intensive agricultural area [3]. However, multitemporal SAR data are still less used than optical data because of their complexity (physical and geometrical), which necessitate specific processing [4]. We investigate here two types of multitemporal SAR data acquired by Radarsat-1 (HH) and Radarsat-2 (HH/HV) for land use characterization on an intensive agricultural area in France. Three objectives are defined:"
1385650,14010,8441,Convexifying optimal power flow: Recent advances in OPF solution methods,2013,"The optimal power flow (OPF) problem is nonconvex and generally hard to solve, see e.g. [1], [2]. In this tutorial, we will provide an overview of two different solution approaches. The first uses the bus injection model, which is the standard model for power flow analysis and optimization. It focuses on nodal variables such as voltages, current and power injections and does not directly deal with power flows on individual branches. A key advantage is the simple linear relationship I = Y V between the nodal current injections I and the bus voltages V through the admittance matrix Y. Recently, it has been observed that this form of OPF can be reformulated as a nonconvex QCQP (quadratic constrained quadratic program), which leads to a standard convex relaxation through semidefinite programming [3]-[5]. For radial networks, different sufficient conditions have been derived under which the semidefinite relaxation turns out to be exact [6]-[8]. The second solution technique employs the branch flow model, which focuses on currents and powers on the branches rather than the nodal variables. The branch flow model has been historically used primarily for modeling distribution circuits, which tend to be radial. It has therefore received far less attention. A branch flow model has recently been proposed for the analysis and optimization of mesh as well as radial networks. The model leads to a new approach to solving OPF that consists of two relaxation steps. The first step eliminates the voltage and current angles and the second step approximates the resulting problem by a conic program that can be solved efficiently. For radial networks, both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there are no upper bounds on loads [9]. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always exact and we provide a simple way to determine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We describe a simple method to convexify a mesh network using phase shifters so that both relaxation steps are always exact and OPF for the convexified network can always be solved efficiently for a globally optimal solution. We prove that convexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the network graph and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power flows, generation, loads, or operating constraints [10]. The tutorial will describe precisely the bus injection model and the semidefinite relaxation of OPF as well as the branch flow model and its associated relaxations. We prove sufficient conditions for exact relaxations and verify our results on simulations of various IEEE test systems. Finally we explain the equivalence between the bus injection model and branch flow model."
1098783,14010,9475,Uniform and complex bids for demand response and wind generation scheduling in multi-period linked transmission and distribution markets,2011,"Power markets serving 70% of US load operate today on period-specific uniform price-quantity bids (UPQBs). However, UPQBs result in a poor representation of utility accruing to many multi period market participants. UPQB can adequately represent utility of consumption only under the restrictive condition that it is additively separable over time. In fact, the additive separability condition is particularly untrue for emerging smart-grid-enabled flexible demands with storage-like characteristics such as EV battery charging and HVAC. We claim that such types of flexible demand exhibit a utility of consumption related to a period-specific state variable - e.g. the battery charge state - whose dynamics are a function of past consumption trajectories. We also claim that wind generation should not be only credited for its energy bids; it should be also charged for the incremental reserves that the Independent System Operator (ISO) must procure to secure system integrity against bids based on volatile wind output forecasts. Appropriate debiting and charging rates equal the market clearing prices resulting from co-optimizing energy and reserve costs. We argue that flexible demand and wind farms that participate in the day-ahead market by submitting UPQBs are motivated to self-dispatch on the basis of energy and reserve clearing price trajectory forecasts. Since actual clearing prices may differ significantly from the forecasts used in the self-dispatch, oscillatory behavior can easily result if actual clearing prices are used as the next forecast. Nevertheless, a smoother price forecast updating process can lead towards Nash Equilibrium. The paper's contribution is the proposal of tractable complex bid rules that (i) allow market participants to reveal their true inter temporal utility of consumption and their net revenue from wind generation, and (ii) enable the market operator to compute the actual Nash equilibrium in a single solution of the market clearing algorithm. The tractability and reasonableness of the complex bid rules are demonstrated through numerical examples."
806479,14010,11104,Estimation of heavy metal concentration in the Pearl River estuarine waters from remote sensing data,2012,"With the increase of population and the development of light industry in the Pearl River Delta area, a great deal of industrial and household waste waters with heavy metals are discharged to the ocean via the river channels. The heavy metals cannot be decomposed but can be transferred and accumulated with food chains [1, 2]. Many heavy metals are toxic to human beings. It is very important to measure the heavy metal concentration in the coastal waters for water quality investigation, environmental management and for security of aquaculture products. The remote sensing technology has been successfully applied for estimation of many parameters of water quality, such as the suspended sediments [3], chlorophyll a, [4–6], CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) [7–8], eutrophication [9–10], salinity [11], and water quality grades [12]. The remote sensing technology has many advantages over the conventional investigation of water quality for its high spatial and temporal resolution, low cost, big coverage of data and synchronization. With its development, the remote sensing technique is expected to retrieve more parameters of water quality. As the heavy metals in water exist in three forms[13–14], each of which is respectively controlled by optically-significant parameters, suspended sediments, dissolved organic matters and phytoplankton. Previous work showed the possibility of detecting heavy metal concentration from remote sensing data[15]. Eight cruises were conducted for in-situ data collection in the Pearl River estuary in August, October, November, December 2009 and February, March, July and October 2010, respectively. An above-water method was used for the measurement of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). The water-leaving radiance, the radiance reflected by a reference panel with 25% reflectance and the sky radiance were measured in turn for 3 times using the Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrometer (wavelength range from 346 to 1037 nm with a spectral resolution of 0.22 nm) at 128 sampling points, where the water samples were synchronously collected for lab analysis of concentration for three heavy metals (Cu, Pb and Zn) and other water components (suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a and CDOM). The in-situ measured Rrs data were calculated to match the bands of EO-1 Hyperion and the Landsat-TM band 1 to 4. The relationships between the concentration of the three heavy metals (Cu, Pb and Zn) and the remote sensing reflectance were analysed. The results showed that all the three heavy metals have good correlative relation with Rrs data. The correlative relation could be improved if it was analyzed respectively from data collected in dry season or wet season, and the correlative relation could be improved with the band ratio of Rrs. Algorithms for estimation of heavy metal concentration were developed using the ratio band combination, which has the maximum correlative coefficient with heavy metals. Then the algorithms were applied to Landsat TM data for estimation of the heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn) concentration. The results showed that the distribution of the three heavy metals' concentration is reasonable."

The results indicate runoff recorded exhibited slight decrease trend from 1961 to 2004, but there is a notable decrease trend of runoff since 1990. It is noteworthy that low stream continued 15 years from 1990 to 2004, besides 1993 and 1999. Moreover, 9 year amount of runoff anomalous percentage below − 30% among 13 years of the low runoff years, account for 69%, contrast to 6.5% from 1736 to 1998. The paper has discussed the cause of the persistent low flow in the upper reaches of Yellow River in recent years based on the data of general circulation of atmosphere, sea-surface temperature(SST), sensible heat flux over Tibetan Plateau, precipitation, temperature, wind speed, sunshine time, amount of evaporation and maximum depth of frozen ground since 1990. The main cause is showed to be persistent low precipitation since 1990, which may be caused by NAOI maintained positive height phase in winter, East Asian big trough leaning depth, West Pacific Ocean subtropical high pressure ridge line position near southerly, greater sensible heat flux in spring and summer over Tibetan Plateau and stronger geothermal fields that easily result in a kind of typical Northwest drought circulation of 500hPa south positive and north negative, west positive and east negative, weak north wind and strong west wind, and deep East Asian trough and strong Xinjiang ridge in summer in East Asian. Secondarily, the reduction of rainy days above 5 mm and steady rainy days, higher temperature and larger evaporation in spring and summer is disadvantageous to create runoff. The results also indicate that the drought of the surface in the basin resulted in the decreasing trend of the runoff."
2364587,14010,11104,"Synergic use of EO, NWP and ground based measurements for the mitigation of vapour artefacts in SAR interferometry",2011,"Spaceborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a well established technique useful in many land applications, such as tectonic movements, landslide monitoring and digital elevation model extraction. One of its major limitation is the atmospheric effect, and in particular the high water vapour spatial and temporal variability which introduces an unknown delay in the signal propagation. This paper describes the general approach and some results achieved in the framework of an ESA funded project devoted to the mapping of the water vapour with the aim to mitigate its effect in InSAR applications. Ground based (microwave radiometers, radiosoundings, GPS) and spaceborne observations (AMSR-E, MERIS, MODIS) of columnar water vapour were compared with Numerical Weather Prediction model runs in Central Italy during a 15-day experiment. A dense network of GPS receivers was deployed close to Como, in Northern Italy, to complement the operational network in order to derive Zenith Total Delay as well as Slant Delay which can support InSAR processing. A comparison with Atmospheric Phase Screens (APS) derived from a sequence of Envisat multi pass interferometric acquisitions processed using the Permanent Scatters technique on the two test sites has been also performed. The acquired experimental data and their comparison give a valuable idea of what can be done to gather information on water vapour, which, besides InSAR applications, plays a fundamental role in weather prediction and radio propagation studies. The work has been carried out in the framework of an ESA funded project, named “Mitigation of Electromagnetic Transmission errors induced by Atmospheric Water Vapour Effects” (METAWAVE). This paper presents the general approach an the various methodologies exploited in the project, together with the overall intercomparison of the results. In deep details on the comparison with the InSAR APS maps derived by the PS technique, as well as on GPS receiver processing and water vapour tomography are reported in two companion papers."

The effort began by identifying and prototyping technologies which enabled the rapid gathering and dissemination of both space-based and ground sensor data and data products for the purpose of flood disaster management. This was followed by an international collaboration to build small portions of the identified system which was prototyped during the past few years during the flood seasons which occurred in the February through May timeframe of 2010 and 2011 with further prototyping to ongoing in 2012. The pilot effort has been fostered by CEOS to facilitate international efforts to promote satellite sensor data interoperability. In particular, the group has been making use of a technology effort call SensorWeb being developed at NASA which leverages Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards to facilitate various satellite and ground sensor interoperability. The group has made use of such satellites such as Earth Observing 1, Terra/Aqua MODIS and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Radarsat together with various ground sensors such as river gauges in Namibia and models such as Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) from Joint Research Center (JRC) from the European Commission. Finally, the group has been experimenting with integrating a large Cloud Computing service provided by the Open Cloud Consortium (OCC) with the SensorWeb to provide management and distribution of the large data sets for emergency workers."
1092154,14010,9475,Preventing cascading failures in microgrids with one-sided support vector machines,2014,"Microgrids formed by a network of power sources and power consumers yield significant advantages over the conventional power grid including proximity of power consumption to power generation, distributed generation, resiliency against wide area blackouts and ease of incorporation of renewable energy sources. On the other hand, unlike the conventional grid, microgrids are compliant where a single load or a single generation unit can often form a significant fraction of the total generation capacity. Here large excursions from the nominal operating conditions are possible motivating the need for safety mechanisms which isolate power electronic equipment from damage. Breakers serve the purpose of protecting equipment from surge conditions by shutting off, for example, generation units. However in microgrids, a loss of a single generation unit can have catastrophic impact on the viability of the entire system. Here settings on breakers cannot be chosen too conservatively to protect the equipment at the expense of system viability or too liberally which will result in equipment damage. The ensuing problem of striking a suitable compromise tends to be combinatoric in nature due to numerous states of breakers which is further exacerbated by an uncertain load profile and nonlinear nature of system dynamics. In this article we provide a methodology to determine current thresholds and guard times, the time interval when current is allowed to exceed threshold value, for each inverter for fail-safe operation of microgrid. We employ a machine learning approach to address the problem where we first demonstrate that conventional support vector machine (SVM) methodology does not yield a satisfactory solution. We then develop a one-sided SVM method and generalize it to yield nonlinear support boundaries which captures the need for fail-safe operation against system blackouts while protecting equipment. A simulation engine is developed to model a real microgrid which is used to generate data for assessing and guiding our approach."
1498124,14010,20896,Defining CPS Challenges in a Sustainable Electricity Grid,2012,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are characterized as complex distributed systems exhibiting substantial uncertainty due to interactions with the physical world. Today's electric grids are often described as CPS because a portfolio of distributed supplies must be dispatched in real-time to match uncontrolled, uncertain demand while adhering to constraints imposed by the intervening transmission and distribution network. With the increased control complexity required by deep penetration of fluctuating renewable supplies, the grid becomes more profoundly a CPS and needs to be addressed as a system. In this evolving CPS, a large fraction of supply is under-actuated, a substantial portion of demand needs to become dispatch able, interactions among distributed elements are no longer unidirectional, and operating requirements of elements are more dynamic. To more sharply define these CPS challenges, we obtain a yearlong, detailed measurement of the real-time blend of supplies on the primary California grid dispatched to meet current demand and then scale the solar and wind assets, preserving uncontrolled weather effects, to a level of penetration associated with California's 2050 GHG targets. In this representation of a future sustainable grid, we assess the impact of demand shaping, storage, and agility on the reconstituted supply portfolio, characterize resulting duration curves and ramping, and investigate the distributed control and management regime. We articulate new operational and market opportunities and challenges that may materialize from intermittent periods of abundance and scarcity in the overall energy network. We find that in a sustainable grid, lulls in renewable production during winter are more critical than peaks in demand during summer, capacity for load shifting and energy storage are more valuable as renewables penetration increases, and that grid balancing requires integrated management of supply and demand resources."
1343602,14010,20896,Stability of a cyber-physical smart grid system using cooperating invariants,2013,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) consist of computational components interconnected by computer networks that monitor and control switched physical entities interconnected by physical infrastructures. Ensuring stability and correctness (both logical and temporal) of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) as a whole is a major challenge in CPS design. Any incorrectness or instability in one component can impact the same features of other components. The fundamental challenge in developing a design framework that unifies the various components is the heterogeneity of the component types, resulting in semantic gaps that must be bridged. For example, while the physical entities in a smart grid are electric devices whose stability and correctness may be expressed in terms of Lyapunov and Lyapunov-like functions, the notion of correctness in the context of the cyber devices are best expressed in the form of a conjunction of logical operators on system parameters.   In our work, we employ a fundamentally different approach than much existing work; our work composes correctness instead of functionality. The basic idea, depicted in Fig 1, is to express the stability and correctness constraints of all components in the form of logical  invariants  and ensure that system actions are performed only if and when they are guaranteed not to violate the conjunction of these invariants.   In recent work [1], we developed invariants that must be satisfied by the physical system to ensure its stability. However, the state of the physical system and, hence, its stability, is dependent on power transfers (migrations) initiated by the cyber algorithm within each node in the system and by the state of the communication network that carries messages between the cyber nodes to signal initiation and acknowledgement of physical power migrations. The state and stability of the communication network is in turn affected by the number of migration messages in transit at any given time. In this poster, we present a distributed, adaptive algorithm for scheduling power migrations between nodes in a smart grid in such a way that the overall stability of the system, including physical and network stability, is maintained. The results show that preserving the system invariant preserves system stability."

FLuORescence Imaging Spectrometer (FLORIS) is the main instrument of the FLEX mission concept. ESA's Earth Science Advisory Committee recommended the investigation of the FLEX concept as an in-orbit demonstrator to be flown as a tandem mission with Sentinel-3 (S-3). S-3 is amongst others equipped with the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). When flown in tandem these instruments are expected to provide an accurate characterization of key atmospheric and surface parameters to facilitate Fs retrieval for FLORIS. In this work the performance of FLORIS and S3-OLCI sensors and their synergy was evaluated on their capability of retrieving relevant biophysical parameters using simulated top-of-atmosphere radiance data (L TOA ). For both sensors, L TOA  data were simulated across a wide range of vegetation, atmospheric and geometry parameters by coupling leaf, canopy and atmospheric radiative transfer models. The pursued analysis was to train for each retrievable parameter (here: Chl, LAI, soil type and F total ) a regression model using the simulated datasets and then evaluate its performance. Two regression types were chosen, a conventional linear regressor and a more advanced nonlinear regressor, and two types of training/validation strategies were followed: a local strategy (at least 2 parameters fixed) and a generic strategy (uniform random subset of the complete dataset). The simulation study led to the following conclusions: 1) FLORIS is well equipped for accurate retrieval of biophysical parameters; 2) however, advanced nonlinear regressors may be needed to achieve robust results, and 3) the large number of bands can lead to redundancy in the nonlinear regressors which can be overcomed by band optimization strategies. Finally, 4) it was demonstrated that a synergy of both FLORIS and S3-OLCI datasets leads to improved biophysical parameter retrieval."

This system will ensure data continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT series of satellites and further enhancement to account of future service evolution. During full operations two identical satellites will be operated. Each satellite embarks the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) that is a push-broom imager providing imagery in 13 spectral channels with spatial resolutions ranging from 10 m to 60 m and a swath width of 290 Km, larger than SPOT and Landsat. The instrument features a sun diffuser covering the full field of view for radiometric calibration, a silicon carbide Three Mirror Anastigmat telescope, specific filter stripe assemblies, newly developed Si-CMOS and HgCdTe detectors and a low noise wavelet compression video electronics. Most of the flight models of the equipments have been delivered and the focal planes and telescope of the MSI Protoflight Model are under assembly, integration and testing. A thorough on-ground characterization of the MSI will be performed to pave the way for the in-flight calibration/validation that will be performed during the commissioning phase.

1022284,14010,11104,The vegetation phenology detection in Amazon tropical evergreen forests using SPOT-VEGETATION 11-y time series,2012,"In tropical regions, the seasonal phenology and the interannual variability of carbon fluxes remain poorly understood, and its representation in global vegetation models highly simplified. However, previous field studies have explored the temporal dynamics of Amazonian vegetation and have shown unexpected and significant seasonal pattern in this ecosystem. Moreover, as a major component of the global terrestrial carbon cycle, the phenological behaviour of this tropical rainforest can significantly influence global dynamics of carbon fluxes and climate. In this context, it is crucial to detect the vegetation phenology in this region. However, field studies are rare and provide local information. By contrast, satellite data from medium resolution sensor offer the advantage of spatial and temporal resolution well adapted to phenological studies. Here, we explore the seasonal characterization of leaf phenology in the Amazon basin through vegetation indices, using a long time series of SPOT-VEGETATION data (2000–2010) at a spatial resolution of 1 km. The analysis is performed locally at a fluxtower site (Santarem) and at the basin scale. Temporal profiles are preliminary analyzed concerning potential artifacts on the cycle observed such as aerosols contamination or BRDF effects. The results indicate that the EVI is better suited than the NDVI to follow the vegetation dynamics in this region. An increase of this index is clearly observed during the dry season, suggesting a higher photosynthetic capacity as it matches higher gross primary production values measured from the fluxtower. Comparing with climate conditions, it is suggested that trees tend to produce new leaves in the dry season to optimize access to light and maximize the carbon uptake."
1520977,14010,11104,Validation of satellite precipitation product at an arid-semiarid basin with complex terrain properties,2013,"Satellite based High Resolution Precipitation Product (HRPP) (generally with a temporal resolution of 3h and spatial resolution of 0.25°×0.25°) is a valuable data source in global and regional hydroclimatologic applications. However uncertainty information for most of the satellite-based HRPPs is unavailable up to present. This paper presents a statistical evaluation study of daily TMPA research time precipitation products at an arid-semiarid basin with complex terrain properties in the northwest of China. Both local scale and regional scale evaluation studies are conducted utilizing gauge based datasets. Total 15 evaluation indices are selected for this study including 5 traditional quantitative statistical indices (CC, RMSE, ME, MAE and BIAS) and 5 categorical statistical indices (POD, FAR, PFB, CSI, and ETS) as well as 5 indices for bias/error decomposition evaluation(HB, MB, FB, RMSEs and RMSEr). New findings about the uncertainty characteristics of TMPA research time precipitation products can be concluded into the following three aspects: (1) both local and regional evaluation results demonstrate that the performance of daily TMPA products is climatology-dependent. For the middle-upper reaches of Heihe river basin, better performance is observed at the southern mountainous area where the climatology is wetter even with consideration of significant terrain effect which is caused by complex topographical variation there. Different bias/error characteristics would appear in different climatology. For the study basin, TMPA products overestimate precipitation in wetter region while make underestimation estimation in drier area. This implies nonuniform bias correction schemes for TMPA products may lead to accuracy improvement. (2) Performance of TMPA products is much worse in snowfall estimation than rainfall estimation and thus one should be cautious to use TMPA daily products in cold region or winter time. (3) little improvement in the performance of TMPA products on daily scale has been made by transition from version 6 to version 7. This study can serve as a reference of the uncertainty in TMPA research time precipitation products in hydrometeorogical applications on watershed scale."
1164905,14010,9475,Deadline differentiated pricing of deferrable electric power service,2012,"As the penetration of wind and solar energy into the electric grid continues to grow, there will be an increasing need to evolve demand-side solutions capable of compensating the inherent variability in power supply from such renewable resources. Today, demand is largely treated as inelastic. However, the power requirements of many commercial and residential loads are such that a fraction of power demand at any given moment is inherently deferrable in time subject to a deadline constraint on the total energy supplied. Examples include thermal systems such as refrigerators, water heaters, HVAC systems, data centers, and, assuming mass adoption of plug-in electric vehicles, batteries. In this paper, we discuss some limitations of dynamic pricing mechanisms (e.g., real-time pricing) as a means of inducing demand response and suggest a novel forward contracting mechanism for deadline-differentiated deferrable energy contracts to alleviate some of these difficulties. Essentially, consumers who consent to deferral of their consumption in time - subject to a pre-specified deadline - will receive a discounted per-unit price for said energy. In this way, the supplier is capable of extracting flexibility in the delivery of energy to participating deferrable loads, while consumers receive a discount on energy with an associated deadline guarantee on delivery. The supply side is modeled as random to capture variability in renewable power supply. Using a general model for consumer preferences to capture the effect of consumption deferral on utility, we prove the existence of a competitive equilibrium and provide a characterization of deadline-differentiated prices yielding such an equilibrium. We also discuss provably optimal online scheduling policies to dynamically allocate the variable supply to a bundle of deadline-differentiated energy tasks."

1759127,14010,11104,Tandem-L: A mission proposal for monitoring dynamic earth processes,2011,"Tandem-L is a mission proposal for an innovative interferometric L-band radar instrument that enables the systematic monitoring of dynamic Earth processes using advanced techniques and technologies. The mission is science driven aiming to provide a unique data set for climate and environmental research, geodynamics, hydrology and oceanography. Important application examples are global forest height and biomass inventories, measurements of Earth deformation due to tectonic processes and/or anthropogenic factors, observations of ice/glacier velocity field and 3-D structure changes, and the monitoring of soil moisture and ocean surface currents. The Tandem-L mission concept consists of two cooperating satellites flying in close formation. The Pol-InSAR and repeat-pass acquisition modes provide a unique data source to observe, analyse and quantify a wide range of mutually interacting processes in the bio-, litho-, hydro- and cryosphere. The systematic observation of these processes benefits from the high data acquisition capacity and the novel high-resolution wide-swath SAR imaging modes that combine digital beamforming with a large reflector antenna. This paper provides an overview of the Tandem-L mission concept and its main application areas. It is planned to realise the Tandem-L mission in cooperation with NASA/JPL. The mission concept was developed in detail in a joint two-year pre-phase A study and it will be further studied in the next 18 months. This will allow a cost-effective implementation, whereby each partner contributes its predevelopments and experience.

1412979,14010,11104,TerraSAR-X pixel localization accuracy: Approaching the centimeter level,2014,The German satellites TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X are high resolution imaging SARs with a resolution in the meter and even sub-meter range. The original product specification document stated an absolute geometric pixel localization accuracy in the same order of magnitude i.e. 1 meter. It was shown by several teams that this accuracy requirement is easily met and even surpassed [1] by the operational products. During the last years the remaining residual error sources could be further studied and attributed mainly to tropospheric delay variations [2] geodynamic effects such as solid earth tides [3] and plate tectonics to refraction in the ionosphere and to technical limitations in the satellite [4]. Our team investigated all these contributions developed correction and calibration methods and validated them in experiments with corner reflectors at different locations. Furthermore we explore novel applications of this high geolocation accuracy that range from classical earth surface displacement measurements to the localization of scatterers in 3D space with a precision comparable to GNSS. This paper provides a summary of latest measurement results of our globally distributed corner reflectors which show consistently a high accuracy better than 2 cm in range and azimuth. Furthermore we report on new developments concerning tropospheric correction using ECMWF and numerical weather models (WRF). Using the best available compensation techniques we can demonstrate accurate 3D localization of corner reflectors and of other objects. Current investigations aim to further improve the orbital accuracy to sub-centimeter level by improved modelling of air-drag and solar radiation pressure on the spacecraft.

SMOS' single payload is MIRAS: the Microwave Imaging Radiometers by Aperture Synthesis in two dimensions. After SMOS' success, today, a number of instruments are planned or under study: the GeoStar instrument is the baseline payload for the Precipitation and All-weather Temperature and Humidity (PATH) mission from NASA (USA), the Geostationary Atmospheric Sounder (GAS) instrument is under study for post-MSG operational satellites observations (Europe), and the Geostationary Interferometric Microwave Sounder (GIMS) instrument from NSSC-CAS (China). The study of the instrument performance in terms of angular resolution and radiometric performance (radiometric sensitivity and accuracy), and the optimization of this new type of instruments is a complex task that requires dedicated ad-hoc tools.

The NPP satellite launched on October 28, 2011, and the scheduled launch dates for the JPSS-1 and JPSS-2 satellites are 2016 and 2022 respectively. Together with the Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS), the system provides global measurements of environmental conditions by collecting, disseminating, and processing data about the Earth's weather, atmosphere, oceans, land, and near-space environment with precision and detail never before achieved by operational weather satellites. This volume of data allows scientists and forecasters to monitor and predict weather patterns with greater speed and accuracy. Official NPP data products are delivered as Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) files. The HDF5 is a general-purpose file format and library designed and developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). The HDF5 was developed to permit flexible, portable, and efficient storage and retrieval of scientific datasets. The NPP uses the HDF5 structure to implement a data model specifically for NPP data products without use of any required extensions to the native library. Some advantages of using the HDF5 include efficient storage and input/output (I/O), including parallel I/O, and the fact that free, open source software are available for use with HDF5 data on multiple platforms [1]. This paper will discuss the HDF5 methodology employed by the NPP to address the problem of efficiently storing the vast quantity of data produced by the system."
1597877,14010,11104,Development of microwave vegetation index from multi-sensor observations,2013,"Microwave Vegetation Indices(MVIs) are newly developed vegetation indices using microwave remote sensing data (SMOS, WindSat, and AMSR-E, respectively). SMOS operates at L-band, in dual polarization and a range of viewing angles. WindSat is a satellite-based multi-frequency and multi-angle polarimetric microwave radiometer with the same transit time as SMOS. Establishing a synergetic vegetation index with WindSat and SMOS data will provide multi-angle and multi-frequency information in vegetation monitoring. As the deducations of previous indices are based on single senor configuration, it is necessary to demonstrate the applicability of the synergy for these two sensors. From the previous research, we found that bare soil emissivities at adjacent frequencies or angles exhibited a good linear relationship under Gaussian correlation function. Whether this relationship exists for L-band and C-band and for Exponential correlation function has to be deeply explored. With this objective, we have built a simulation database using the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) at L-band (SMOS, 1.4GHz, multi-angle) and C-band ( WindSat, 6.8GHz, 53.5°) in dual-polarization (v and h), respectively. The relationships of the surface emissivities are significantly different, while the fresnel reflectivity exhibits linear relationship. Hence, we consider using fresnel reflectivity to establish the bridge between different sensors. The radiation of vegetated land surface can be described by a 0th-order radiative transfer model. The total emission from ground can be rearranged into a linear model with the vegetation emission component as the intercept and the vegetation transmission component as the slope. With this linear relationship, the Fresnel reflectivity at one frequency can be expressed as a linear function of that at another frequency. And the intercept and the slope are the newly derived vegetation indices. They are mainly affected by vegetation properties and have a consistent spatial pattern with NDVI."

A MicroMAS flight unit is currently being developed in anticipation of a 2014 launch. A parabolic reflector is mechanically rotated as the spacecraft orbits the earth, thus directing a cross-track scanned beam with FWHM beamwidth of 2.4-degrees, yielding an approximately 20-km diameter footprint at nadir incidence from a nominal altitude of 500 km. Radiometric calibration is carried out using observations of cold space, the earth's limb, and an internal noise diode that is weakly coupled through the RF front-end electronics. A key technology feature is the development of an ultra-compact intermediate frequency processor module for channelization, detection, and A-to-D conversion. The antenna system and RF front-end electronics are highly integrated and miniaturized.

1477886,14010,11104,"FHYL: Field spectral libraries, airborne hyperspectral images and topographic and bathymetric LiDAR data for complex coastal mapping",2013,"Remote sensing of coastal ecosystems provides fundamental information for the effective assessment of valuable natural habitat. A synoptic view of the shallow submerged and emerged coastal landscape can offer the quantitative ability to obtain spatially explicit data over large and complex areas, where the heterogeneity of habitat is mixed by vegetation and sediment/soil interactions at the interface with water and atmosphere. In the present paper, by combining field radiometry with contemporary airborne hyperspectral imagery and topographic and bathymetric LiDAR data, an innovative approach with the application of Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) and Multiple Linear Regression models is proposed in order to define shallow coastal seabed, beach and dune habitat at the finest scale. The implemented FHyL (Field spectral libraries, airborne Hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR altimetry) processing chain leads to an innovative mapping results obtained by an integration of multisensory data. Presence and typology of vegetated and unvegetated beach is represented as the abundance of each physical response within the hyperspectral reflectance by building multisensory and multidimensional hyperspectral - LiDAR mixture space. Mineralogical and sedimentological proprieties of the beach sediment was estimated by using field and airborne spectral libraries combined with sediment sampling in a multiple linear regression statistical model. Therefore, FHyL represents the multisensory data fusion process to classify and map vegetation presence and distribution, as well as sediment properties and geomorphology of complex coastal seabed, and beaches dunes systems. The present research is a novel input for multilayered analysis in biophysical studies and its application on multi temporal dataset modeling of coast evolution."
1092269,14010,9475,LPV system identification using a separable least squares support vector machines approach,2014,"In this article, an algorithm to identify LPV State Space models for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems is proposed. The LPV state space system is in the Companion Reachable Canonical Form. The output vector coefficients are linear combinations of a set of a possibly infinite number of nonlinear basis functions dependent on the scheduling signal, the state matrix is either time invariant or a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions of the scheduling signal and the input vector is time invariant. This model structure, although simple, can describe accurately the behaviour of many nonlinear SISO systems by an adequate choice of the scheduling signal. It also partially solves the problems of structural bias caused by inaccurate selection of the basis functions and high variance of the estimates due to over-parameterisation. The use of an infinite number of basis functions in the output vector increases the flexibility to describe complex functions and makes it possible to learn the underlying dependencies of these coefficients from the data. A Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) approach is used to address the infinite dimension of the output coefficients. Since there is a linear dependence of the output on the output vector coefficients and, on the other hand, the LS-SVM solution is a nonlinear function of the state and input matrix coefficients, the LPV system is identified by minimising a quadratic function of the output function in a reduced parameter space; the minimisation of the error is performed by a separable approach where the parameters of the fixed matrices are calculated using a gradient method. The derivatives required by this algorithm are the output of either an LTI or an LPV (in the case of a time-varying SS matrix) system, that need to be simulated at every iteration. The effectiveness of the algorithm is assessed on several simulated examples."
1876443,14010,11104,"A study of dense medium scattering and its applications in sea ice research in ross island, antarctica",2011,"This paper summarizes the study of dense medium scattering and its applications towards sea ice research in Ross Island, Antarctica. Based on the Radiative Transfer Theory and earlier work by Tjuatja and Fung, an improvement to the phase matrix to account for the near field effects of electrically dense media was developed, called the Dense Medium Phase and Amplitude Correction Theory (DM-PACT). An analysis on the scattering of discrete scatterers in an electrically dense medium was carried out and a backscattering model based on the iterative solution of Radiative Transfer Theory, incorporating both the DM-PACT and the IEM model to characterize for rough surface was later developed. With the concern on climate change, the study shifted towards the application of dense medium scattering on sea ice and ice shelf. Using ground truth measurement data collected from Ross Island, Antarctica to compute the backscattering coefficient with the developed forward model, a good matching was obtained between the model predictions and the satellite measurements from RADARSAT. The model was then extended to incorporate multiple layers to take into account the effect of the snow layer on top of the sea ice. A good matching was obtained between the multi-layer model, the Matrix Doubling Method and the CEAREX measurements. From here, the research moved towards the development of inverse models for the purpose of sea ice thickness retrieval due to the parameter's importance in the study of climate change. For active remote sensing, the Radiative Transfer Inverse Scattering Model (RTISM), utilizing the RT-DMPACT forward model and Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization Algorithm was proposed. Initial results with the model showed good matching between measurement data and model predictions. For passive microwave remote sensing, two models were proposed for sea ice thickness retrieval: the training of neural networks using the RT-DMPACT forward model and the use of Genetic Algorithm for sea ice thickness retrieval. Both methods showed promise and the results were encouraging."

Elemental composition results for the 2006 AEROSE samples based on energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis system indicate a well-mixed dust-urban plume regime and reveal the presence of Al, C, Ca, Cd, Cl, Fe, K, Mg, Na, O, Pb, S, and Si; while the 2009 samples being predominantly dust aerosols were dominated by crustal elements such as Al, Ca, Cl, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Na, O, P, S, Si, Sn, Ti, and Zn. The secondary electron images for both years reveal a variety of morphologies, but were dominated by chain-like association of spherules and non-spherical particles. Raman Microscopy affords an interpretation of the surface chemical processing and mixing state and revealed the presence of significant hydrocarbons in 2006, and sulfate for both years. Back trajectories show an outflow of air masses from Mauritania, Senegal, and a weak outflow from Algeria-Mali border for 2006 and Libya for 2009."
1269837,14010,9475,Flexible loads and renewable integration: Distributed control and price of anarchy,2013,"New sources of uncertainty and variability are being introduced into modern power grids creating new control challenges. Examples include renewable generation from solar and wind generators, electric vehicles, etc. In addition, there is compelling value in reducing the peak electric power demand as that has a direct beneficial impact of reducing the need for new capital investments in overall power sector. Introduction of new sensing, communications and computational elements offers opportunities for novel control solutions. One promising approach to addressing these problems is to exploit the inherent flexibility in many types of electric power loads and use that to accommodate the inherent variability in renewable generation and/or to reduce the peak demand. In this paper, we focus on electric vehicles(EVs) as flexible loads in the context of renewable generation. We take an intra-day time horizon where we assume we have a good prediction of renewable generation. Based on the supply schedule of thermal generators and predicted supply of renewable generation, the charging of the electric vehicles is controlled to minimize the imbalance between generation and consumption using centralized and distributed control algorithms. We develop a pricing scheme based on the proportional allocation mechanism for the distributed case. Assuming individual loads are price takers, we show that there is a time varying price which can be set by the control authority such that it's objective aligns with the individual's objective. If the users are price anticipators, the corresponding situation can be formulated in a game-theoretic setting. Distributed algorithms are developed to compute solution in both the cases. We also analyze the “price of anarchy” and show that the worst case loss of efficiency is 0.25."
1589947,14010,9475,A decentralized ID algorithm for detecting slow-fast oscillations in power systems from overwhelming volumes of phasor data,2012,"As the number of sensors, namely Phasor Measurement Units or PMUs, in the US power transmission grid scales up into the thousands within the next few years, the current state-of-the-art centralized data processing architecture will no longer be sustainable, and decentralized algorithms must be developed instead. In this paper we propose such an algorithm for one of the most critical applications in power system monitoring- namely, modal decomposition of swing dynamics for detecting slow and fast oscillation modes in the system with evaluation of their respective damping factors. Given a multiple set of coherent generation clusters in the system, we first use data from all PMU sources to calculate the oscillatory modes, their damping and participation in a centralized fashion. Next, we categorize the PMUs into several disjoint sets, and use the data from each of these sets to evaluate the modal frequencies for the entire system individually, assuming that the network has a connected topology guaranteeing system observability. A global estimate for any specific eigenvalue of interest is then computed from the geometric mean of those obtained from the disjoint estimation, and analytical expressions are derived to indicate how this geometric mean, representing the ‘fused distributed solution’ compares to the centralized solution. A discussion on how the output nodes in the network should be chosen appropriately contingent on the topological structure of the network, in order to minimize the error between the two estimates is also presented. We illustrate our results with prototype power system network models inspired by two well-known transfer paths in the US west coast grid."
1427433,14010,8441,"Simultaneous stabilization and optimization of unknown, time-varying systems",2013,"Extremum Seeking (ES) has a long history as a tool for locating the extremum points of unknown functions. Recently, by using the ES method to seek the minimum of Lyapunov functions, the ES approach has been demonstrated as a tool for stabilization of unknown systems, removing the distinction between optimization and stabilization. This work combines the dual aspects of the ES method for simultaneous stabilization and optimization. The resulting control scheme optimizes the output of unknown maps, of unknown and possibly unstable, time-varying dynamic systems. Intuitively the approach can be thought of as achieving trajectory tracking of an unknown trajectory, which is the time-varying optimal point of a time-varying map, despite the influence of unstable system dynamics. The motivation for this is the control of an autonomous vehicle, which is chasing a source whose trajectory is unknown, but which is somehow detectable with the detection strength dropping off as a function of distance, physical examples of which may be electric charge, temperature, or chemical concentration. The destabilizing terms may be thought of as unknown environmental variables, such as wind or fluid flow, which may push the autonomous vehicle away from its desired path. Obviously, the multi-dimensional results presented here can be applied to more abstract systems, with many dimensions, such as the states (voltages, currents...) of multiple components of complicated circuits operating in unknown conditions. The results presented guarantee that the system's state will converge to and remain ultimately bounded within some local max/min of the unknown, time-varying output function. In the case of the output having a global max/min ultimate boundedness to within a neighborhood of the global extremum is guaranteed."
1029958,14010,9475,Pi-Invariant Unscented Kalman Filter for sensor fusion,2014,"A novel approach based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed for nonlinear state estimation. The Invariant UKF, named π-IUKF, is a recently introduced algorithm dedicated to nonlinear systems possessing symmetries as illustrated by the quaternion-based mini Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) kinematics modeling considered in this paper. Within an invariant framework, this algorithm suggests a systematic approach to determine all the symmetry-preserving terms which correct accordingly the nonlinear state-space representation used for prediction, without requiring any linearization. Thus, based on both invariant filters, for which Lie groups have been identified and UKF theoretical principles, the developed π-IUKF has been previously and successfully applied to the mini-RPAS attitude estimation problem, highlighting remarkable invariant properties. We propose in this paper to extend the theoretical background and the applicability of our proposed π-IUKF observer to the case of a mini-RPAS equipped with an aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) which leads to augment the nonlinear state space representation with both velocity and position differential equations. All the measurements are provided on board by a set of low-cost and low-performance sensors (accelerometers, gyrometers, magnetometers, barometer and even Global Positioning System (GPS)). Our designed π-IUKF estimation algorithm is described in this paper and its performances are evaluated by exploiting successfully real flight test data. Indeed, the whole approach has been implemented onboard using a data logger based on the well-known Paparazzi system. The results show promising perspectives and demonstrate that nonlinear state estimation converges on a much bigger set of trajectories than for more traditional approaches"

Multi-angle images provide the volume scattering information which could improve inversion accuracy. HJ-1 satellites are the sun synchronous recurrent frozen orbit small satellite constellation for environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting and were launched on September 6, 2008, China, with a repetition cycle of two days. Now 6 angle observations have been built up from several days of HJ-1A / B images. Images were first calibrated both geometrically and atmospherically. A simplified Geometric-Optical(SGM) model was used for the parameters estimation. The background estimation was conducted from the LiSparse-RossThin kernel weights and the Walthall empirical model. Then, the three kernel weights of the LiSparse-RossThin model were retrieved for each location. Finally, the shrub cover and radius were retrieved from SGM model. Biomass was estimated from the shrub cover and radius. 21 plots for background estimation and verification were measured during July 2009. The R 2  between simulated cover and measured cover is 0.21, but the RMSE of the model fitting is 0.09. The distribution of the shrub cover estimated from multi-angle HJ images is coincidence with fine resolution Google Earth image. So is the biomass distribution. The weak relationship may be because the higher spatial heterogeneity, the view angles' limitation, and the time variance among images. The multi-angle HJ images are low cost which is useful in far and extended sandland monitoring and evaluation. The results reported here also showed that the development of HJ satellite data for wide range of mapping application."
1715775,14010,11104,Ground moving target indication in a SAR image based on background cognition,2013,"Ground moving target indication (GMTI) with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a very hot research topic in recent years. The traditional methods are based on multi-antennae technology, such as displaced-phase-center-antenna [1], along-track interferometry [2], and space time adaptive processing [3], and many space-borne or air-borne radars have been developed and put in use. However, the multi-antennae based technology is very complex and costs so much. Many researchers try to perform the tasks by using a single-antenna SAR. For example, J. R. Fienup detects the moving target by using autofocus technology based on shear averaging method [4], J. Dias et al. use the antenna radiation pattern information to indicate the moving targets and estimate their velocities [5], and G. Lv et al. detects and estimates the azimuth velocity component based on the symmetric defocusing method [6]. They can give fairly effective results. However, the mentioned methods exploit the phase difference between the background and moving targets, and the effectiveness will be influenced by clutters and interference. A new GMTI scheme used to detect moving targets with range velocity components is proposed in this paper based on background cognition. The scheme consists of four parts: a normalized background Doppler spectrum set (BDSS), a correlator used to extract the background of a given azimuth vector in a SAR imagery, a normalized moving targets' Doppler spectrum set (MTDSS), and a classifier used to optimally classify the moving targets according to the waveform design algorithms [7]. The output of the classifier are feed back to the correlator to estimate the background further. As a result, the classifier gives more accurate estimations of moving targets. It is a closed-loop procedure. The scheme works well in our recent experiments."
1196484,14010,8441,Constrained optimization for opportunistic distributed visual sensing,2013,"Distributed networks of dynamically controllable pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras have high potential utility for tracking and high-res imaging of targets-of-interest maneuvering within a surveillance area. The actual utility that is achieved is determined by the real-time selection of the networked camera PTZ parameters to collaboratively achieve these objectives. This paper proposes a control mechanism for such a network to obtain opportunistic high-res facial imagery via distributed constrained optimization of PTZ parameters for each camera in the network. The objective function quantifies the per camera per target image quality. The tracking constraint that defines the feasible PTZ parameter space is a lower bound on the information about the estimated position for each target. All cameras optimize their PTZ parameters simultaneously using information broadcast by neighboring cameras. At certain time steps, due to the configuration of the targets relative to the cameras, and the fact that each camera may track many targets, the camera network may be able to achieve the tracking specification with remaining degrees-of-freedom that can be used to obtain high-res facial images from desirable aspect angles. The challenge is to define algorithms to automatically find these time instants, the appropriate imaging camera, and the appropriate parameter settings for all cameras to capitalize on these opportunities. The solution proposed herein involves a Bayesian formulation (for an automatic trade off of objective maximization versus the risk of losing track of any target), design of aligned local and global objective functions and the inequality constraint set, and development of a Distributed Lagrangian Consensus algorithm that allows cameras to exchange information and asymptotically converge on a pair of primal-dual optimal solutions. This article presents the theoretical solution along with simulation results."

Four mission objectives are disaster mitigation, environmental monitoring as represented by forest and cryospheric monitoring, land monitoring, and technology development. PALSAR-2 onboard ALOS-2 will provide 1-3-m high-resolution Spotlight and Strip with multiple polarizations with an imaging swath of 25/50/70 km, ScanSAR with dual polarizations with a 350/490 km swath, a shorter temporal baseline of 14 days and spatial baseline of within 1 km, emergency observation service within a 12-h delay for any global target and especially within a 72-h (74 h in the worst case) delay as synchronized observation with the archives, i.e., same off-nadir and observation mode, and ScanSAR interferometry with more than 90% global beam synchronization. The ALOS-2 science program initiates the calibration, validation, and application research of PALSAR-2/ALOS-2 and Pi-SAR-L2. As application research, disaster mitigation and the urban-area monitoring using the high-resolution data should contribute significantly to safety since disasters have occurred frequently and globally in the recent past. High-resolution and multi-polarimetric SAR with a shorter revisit time ensures quicker detection of land changes. In this paper, we summarize the contents of the ALOS-2 science program and its expected outcomes. Some application examples of disaster mitigation using recent high-resolution SARs, i.e., Pi-SAR-L2 and PALSAR, are also introduced."

Aryabhatta Research Institute for Observational Sciences (ARIES) located at Nainital(29.24 0 N,79.28 0 E) at an altitude of 6250 m is making Aerosol optical depth measurements using LIDARS and other atmospheric measurements routinely. In order to augment the facilities for measurement of atmospheric dynamics, and to study exchanges between different layers of atmosphere, Stratosphere Troposphere (ST) radar with height coverage of 20 Kms is being established. Based on this initiative the Department of Science and Technology of the Government of India is planning for a network of such ST radars, over the subcontinent. This paper describes the design aspects of the active aperture phased array radar designed at 206.5 MHz for measuring three dimensional wind vector over the troposphere and lower stratosphere regions of the tropical atmosphere. As a proof of design one sub array of 49 elements was integrated with the exciter and receiver signal processor and trial runs were made at ECIL Hyderabad. The results obtained shows wind profiles upto 6 to 7 kms, which was as per expectations and thus validated the design approach. Horizontal winds obtained were compared on a day (April 25, 2012), when a GPS sonde of opportunity was launched from Hyderabad."
1518129,14010,9475,Turbulence modeling and Kalman prediction for the control of large AO systems,2013,"Measurements of large ground telescopes are affected by the presence of the terrestrial atmospheric turbulence: local changes of the atmospheric refraction index (e.g. due to wind and temperature variations) cause a non flat surface of the wavefront of light beams incoming on the telescope, thus degrading the quality of the observed images. Adaptive Optics (AO) systems are of fundamental importance to reduce such atmospheric influence on ground telescopes and thus to obtain high resolution observations. The goal of the AO system is that of estimating and compensating the atmospheric turbulence effect by properly commanding a set of deformable mirrors. Because of delays in the closed loop system, the Kalman filter plays an important role in ensuring an effective control performance by providing good atmosphere predictions. However, the need of periodically updating the Kalman filter gain because of changes in the atmosphere characteristics, the increase of telescopes and sensors resolutions and the high sampling rate impose quite strict restrictions to the computational load for computing the Kalman gain. Motivated by the above considerations, some strategies have been recently considered in the system theory and astronomical communities for the efficient computation of the Kalman gain for large AO systems. Specifically, this paper presents some changes to a recently proposed procedure: the proposed approach, which exploits some results in the control theory of distributed systems, computes an approximation of the optimal gain in the frequency domain exploiting the spatial homogeneity of the system. Then, the control strategy takes advantage of some information on the turbulent phase dynamic, that is estimated from the turbulence measurements. Performances of the proposed method are investigated in some simulations."
1968949,14010,11104,Ecosystem parameter mapping in Swiss National Park based on a continuous fields approach,2013,"Adequate assessment and management of landscape patterns and processes need proper representation and quantification of gradients of ecosystem biochemical and structural properties. Discrete land cover mapping approaches represent landscapes as classified entities with “hard” boundaries. On the other hand, continuous field representations of land cover or ecosystem parameters offer the potential to overcome the limitations of classified entities that can often not reproduce the full range and variability of land surface properties. This paper presents a concept to generate continuous fields (CF) maps of ecosystem parameters in an alpine environment. The concept is exemplarily presented on a high mountain ecosystem's total (above ground) water content and is performed in the upper Trupchun valley (Val Trupchun) in the Swiss National Park (SNP). It is applicable to further parameters. Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer (IS) data collected over the SNP in June 2010 and 2011 are used for CF mapping of water content. Abundance maps of predominant land cover classes are derived from linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA). They are then combined with individual thematic water content information of the respective land cover originating from either spectral indices or a physically based approach. The resulting product depicts a spatially continuous representation of total water content. The availability of APEX IS data from two consecutive seasons allows studying differences in ecosystem water content over time. CF maps can be generated for a wide range of ecosystem parameters. If multi-temporally available, such products can be useful for explaining ecological patterns such as animal grazing patterns in SNP."
866729,14010,11104,An extension of the integral equation model IEM2M for rough surfaces of complex permittivity,2012,"The integral equation model (IEM) developed by A.K. Fung and co-workers has arguably been the most cited and implemented rough surface scattering model in the field of radar remote sensing. It was obtained as a second-order iteration of the incident electromagnetic field to the integral equations of the surface fields. Therefore, it is an extension of the first-order Born approximation of the corresponding Neumann series that produce the classical Kirchhoff approximation. The IEM was tuned many times over the last twenty years due to the imperfect introduction and handling of the Weyl representation of the spherical wave in its first version. The work presented here is a development of the contribution made by the same author in 2001 (IEM2M) and reported extensively in [1] (IEM2Mc). It has been the first version of IEM able to blend analytically both the Kirchhoff and the small-perturbation approximations for the bistatic case and dielectric surfaces. IEM2M was celebrated by those who found the original IEM not enough rigorous but also criticized by Fung and his co-workers. In this paper an extension of IEM2M is presented that extends it in two aspects: the inclusion of evanescent waves in the formulation of the model and the extension of the range of applicability of the second-order scattering terms to interfaces with complex permittivity scattering media. These two issues had only been addressed in the IEM version developed by Du. However, Du needed to make a mathematical assumption on the correlation function which was not explained from a physical point of view. In the work proposed here this assumption is not necessary. Although all these issues are dealt with extensively in [1], this paper focuses on the comparison of IEM2M, IEM2Mc, the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) and the Small Perturbation Method (SPM). account of them. Regarding IEM, Fung's last update on his version of IEM is available in [2]"
1248921,14010,9475,NUROA: A numerical roadmap algorithm,2014,"Motion planning has been studied for nearly four decades now. Complete, combinatorial motion planning approaches are theoretically well-rooted with completeness guarantees but they are hard to implement. Sampling-based and heuristic methods are easy to implement and quite simple to customize but they lack completeness guarantees. Can the best of both worlds be ever achieved, particularly for mission critical applications such as robotic surgery, space explorations, and handling hazardous material? In this paper, we answer affirmatively to that question. We present a new methodology, NUROA, to numerically approximate the Canny's roadmap, which is a network of one-dimensional algebraic curves. Our algorithm encloses the roadmap with a chain of tiny boxes each of which contains a piece of the roadmap and whose connectivity captures the roadmap connectivity. It starts by enclosing the entire space with a box. In each iteration, remaining boxes are shrunk on all sides and then split into smaller sized boxes. Those boxes that are empty are detected in the shrink phase and removed. The algorithm terminates when all remaining boxes are smaller than a resolution that can be either given as input or automatically computed using root separation lower bounds. Shrink operation is cast as a polynomial optimization with semialgebraic constraints, which is in turn transformed into a (series of) semidefinite programs (SDP) using the Lasserre's approach. NUROA's success is due to fast SDP solvers. NUROA correctly captured the connectivity of multiple curves/skeletons whereas competitors such as IBEX and Realpaver failed in some cases. Since boxes are independent from one another, NUROA can be parallelized particularly on GPUs. NUROA is available as an open source package at http://nuroa.sourceforge.net/."
1153080,14010,9475,Optimal frequency separation of power sources by multivariable LPV/H ∞ control: Application to on-board energy management systems of electric vehicles,2014,"In this paper a multi-variable LPV/H ∞  control approach is applied to design a strategy for power source coordination within a multi-source energy system. Three different kinds of power sources - fuel cell, battery and ultracapacitor - compose the power supply system of an electric vehicle. All sources are current-controlled and paralleled together with their associated DC-DC converters on a common DC-link coupled to vehicle's electrical motor and its converter. DC-link voltage must be regulated in spite of load power variations representing the driving cycle image. To this end, a MIMO LPV/H ∞  provides the three current references so that each source operates in its most suitable frequency range as either high-energy-density or high-power-density source: low-frequency, the mean power is provided by the fuel cell, the ultracapacitor supplies/absorbs the instantaneous variations of power demand and the battery operates in between the two other sources. Selection of H ∞  weighting functions is guided by a genetic algorithm whose optimization criterion expresses the frequency-separation requirements. The nonlinear multi-source system is simulated in MATLABP ®  /Simulink ®  using the driving cycle of IFSTTAR (Institut Francais des Sciences et Technologies des Transports, de l'Amenagement et des Reseaux) as load profile, whose frequency content is richer than the one of Normalized European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Simulation results show good performance in supplying the load at constant DC-link voltage according to user-configured frequency-separation power sharing strategy."

The system should provide satellite based products capable to help fire contrasting activities during all the phases: prevision, detection, and damage assessment/recovering. In particular, the paper concerns the development of a Fire Risk Index to be produced daily with the objective of showing the total level of risk for the area of interest and the zones of major concern within such area. In the European Community the member countries interested by forest fires are at least six: Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, and Greece. The higher number of wild fires occurs in the western part of Spain and Portugal, in southern Italy and in the Mediterranean islands The idea to develop maps able to show the fire risk is based on the observation that there is a tight relationship between the fire and the characteristics of the fuel (vegetation type, density, humidity content), of the topography (slope, altitude, solar aspect angle) and the meteorological conditions (rainfall, wind direction and speed, air humidity, surface and air temperature). These parameters directly impact the proneness of a given area to the fire ignition and propagation. Since these quantities can be measured, notwithstanding the cause of the fire ignition, mainly due, in Italy, to human actions (more than 90% of the ignitions is intentional or accidental), could be unpredictable the behaviour of the fire can be considered strictly dependent from those and then it can be foreseen when such parameters are known."

We produced a 0.5°×1.0° lat-lon daily gridded near fundamental decadal data record (FDDR) of AIRS all sky brightness temperatures (BT) for all 2378 AIRS channels including the 4µ and 12µ surface windows for the 9-year period. We show (i) that decadal difference trends between the spectrally convolved AIRS and MODIS IR surface channels 3.96µ, 4.05µ and 12.03µ are as small as 0.01K, 0.016K and 0.001K per year respectively, suitable to detect year to year decadal trends of AIRS global surface BTs as small as 0.1K over the decade. (ii) The analysis of gridded AIRS surface BT channel 4.16µ and 12.18µ reveals no global annual warming trend between 2003–2011 and negligible trends for both hemispheres in the 9-year period. (iii) Both AIRS channels 4.16µ and 12.18µ show a statistically significant global annual BT warming trend of 0.6K and 0.87K respectively in the Arctic (60N–90N) with yearly changes varying by as much as 1.6K. (iv) Finally, we show that AIRS global surface BT spectral channel 4.16µ has a correlation with annual, seasonal and monthly GISS global station surface temperature data records 0.96, 0.9, 0.82 respectively. We conjecture that direct satellite level 1B AIRS IR radiance sounding observations constitute a FDDR and that well calibrated IR surface BTs can serve as a surrogate for directly observing global climate surface temperatures."
1307951,14010,9475,Bounded control based on saturation functions of nonlinear under-actuated mechanical systems: The cart-pendulum system case,2011,"We are concerned in this paper by bounded control of nonlinear underactuated dynamical systems. We focus our exposition on a feedback-based stabilization bounded control action shaped by saturation functions. A simple stabilizing controller for the well-known cart-pendulum system is then designed in this paper. Our control strategy describes in lumped linear time-invariant terms the concerned underactuated nonlinear system as a cascade nonlinear dynamical system consisted of a simple chain of four integrators with a high-order smooth nonlinear perturbation, and assumes initialization of the resulting underactuated system in the upperhalf plane. Our proposed feedback-based regulation design procedure involves the simultaneous combination of two control actions: one bounded linear and one bounded quasilinear. Control boundedness is provided in both involved control actions by specific saturation functions. The first bounded control action brings the non-actuated coordinate near to the upright position and keep it inside of a well-characterized small vicinity, whereas the second bounded control action asymptotically brings the whole state of the dynamical system to the origin. The necessary closed-loop stability analysis uses standard linear stability arguments as well as the traditional well-known Lyapunov method and the LaSalle's theorem. Our proposed control law ensures global stability of the closed-loop system in the upper half plane, while avoiding the necessity of solving either partial differential equations, nonlinear differential equations or fixed-point controllers. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy via numerical simulations."
988158,14010,9475,Toward force control of a quadrotor UAV in SE(3),2012,"Two novel model-free second order sliding mode controllers are proposed for the constrained underactuated position and orientation dynamic model of the quadrotor, i.e., considering contact wrench, based on spring-like contact force model. The main theorem establishes conditions for the closed-loop system to guarantee semi-global exponential and robust tracking of position and admissible contact forces, with zero yaw, by exploiting the solution in SE(3). It is proved an integral sliding mode for all time and for any initial condition at a quaternion-based sliding surface. This yields a causal and analytical computation of desired angular velocity in terms of position control, without involving derivatives of the state. A second theorem is derived for terminal stability with desired finite time convergence. This in turns produces three results, a) a singularity-free representation under proper and easy to meet initialization; b) stable transition from free flying to constrained motion, and c) realization of the virtual position controller due to finite time convergence of angular tracking errors. It is noted that there arises an evident physical limit for force interaction along underactuated directions: the more interaction force along the underactuated axes, the more roll and pitch angles are needed the less thrust that can be produced to sustain the UAV in the air. Comprehensive simulation study is discussed under various flying conditions, and finally, the explicit (active) force control, based on a differential algebraic model, is briefly addressed."
653353,14010,11104,Large-scalewater classification of coastal areas using airborne topographic lidar data,2013,"Accurate Digital Terrain Models (DTM) are inevitable inputs for mapping areas subject to natural hazards. Topographic lidar scanning has become an established technique to characterize the Earth surface: and reconstruct the topography. For flood hazard modeling in coastal areas, the key step before terrain modeling is the discrimination of land and water surfaces within the delivered point clouds. Therefore, instantaneous shoreline, river borders, inland waters can be extracted as a basis for more reliable DTM generation. This paper presents an automatic, efficient, and versatile workflow for land/water classification of airborne topographic lidar data. For that purpose, a classification framework based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) is designed. First, a set of features, based only 3D lidar point coordinates and flightline information, is defined. Then, the SVM learning step is performed on small but well-targeted areas thanks to an automatic region growing strategy. Finally, label probabilities given by the SVM are merged during a probabilistic relaxation step in order to remove pixel-wise misclassification. Results over two large areas show that survey of millions of points are labelled with high accuracy (>95%) and that small features of interest are still well classified though we work at low point densities (2-3pts/m 2 ). Finally, our approach provides a strong basis for further discrimination of coastal land-cover classes and habitats."
971188,14010,8441,Model predictive control with a rigorous model of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,2013,"Degradation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) can be minimized by maintaining reliability parameters during load changes. These reliability parameters are critical to maintain power generation efficiency over an extended life of the SOFC. For SOFCs to be commercially viable, the life must exceed 20,000 hours for load following applications. This is not yet achieved because transient stresses damage the fuel cell and degrade the performance over time. This study relates the development of a dynamic model for SOFC systems in order to predict optimal manipulated variable moves along a prediction horizon. The model consists of hundreds of states and parameters that permit tracking of a realistic response. Previously, this detailed model was too computationally intensive to run in parallel with the SOFC process. The contribution of this paper is an application study to enable a large-scale simulation model to be used in Model Predictive Control (MPC) without simplification. Such a technology permits real time calculation of controller moves while loads are followed during operation. The contribution demonstrates the assumptions and approach necessary to provide real-time calculations for optimal predictive control operations using a rigorous model of the SOFC process. Large-scale process models are rarely employed in real-time control because of the prohibitive computational expense necessary to complete the calculations within the specified cycle time. An efficient model based predictive controller reduces operational fluctuations related to the startup and shutdown conditions, without exceeding reliability limits in the cells."
1522308,14010,9475,Building temperature control with adaptive feedforward,2013,"A common approach to the modeling of temperature evolution in a multi-zone building is to use thermal resistance and capacitance to model zone and wall dynamics. The resulting thermal network may be represented as an undirected graph. The thermal capacitances are the nodes in the graph, connected by thermal resistances as links. The temperature measurements and temperature control elements (heating and cooling) in this lumped model are collocated. As a result, the input/output system is strictly passive and any passive output feedback controller may be used to improve the transient and steady state performance without affecting the closed loop stability. The storage functions associated with passive systems may be used to construct a Lyapunov function, to demonstrate closed loop stability and motivate the construction of an adaptive feedforward control to compensate for the variation of the ambient temperature and zone heat loads (due to changing occupancy). The approach lends itself naturally to an inner-outer loop control architecture where the inner loop is designed for stability, while the outer loop balances between temperature specification and power consumption. Energy efficiency consideration may be added by adjusting the target zone temperature based on user preference and energy usage. The initial analysis uses zone heating/cooling as input, but the approach may be extended to more general model where the zonal mass flow rate is the control variable. A four-room example with realistic ambient temperature variation is included to illustrate the performance of the proposed passivity based control strategy."
964654,14010,9475,HJB-based optimal nonlinear control for multiple objectives in different levels of excitations,2014,"Linear control laws are the most common control strategies, primarily due to their simplicity in both design and implementation. While there are a multitude of accepted techniques for designing linear control strategies for mitigating the response of structures due to external loads and excitations, there are no elegant and widely-applied nonlinear methods. While the optimal linear control law that minimizes a quadratic cost function can be carried out simply with standard tools (e.g., MATLAB's lqr command), a nonquadratic cost function leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation that results in an optimal nonlinear controller. However, finding the exact analytical solution of the HJB equation is very difficult; it may only have a solution when the cost function is cast in a particular form. This paper suggests a particular form of a nonlinear control law for civil structures designed to minimize one objective (a serviceability and performance measure) for small excitation and small response, and a different objective (life safety) for larger motion. An analytical approach is presented to cast the nonquadratic cost function in a form for which the HJB equation can be solved. The resulting optimal nonlinear control law can be written as the sum of a linear term, which is related to an LQR problem and is effective in small excitations, and some nonlinear terms that dominate when the excitation level is large. The performance of the proposed nonlinear control strategy is demonstrated by a numerical simulation for a simple building model subjected to different historical earthquakes and a synthetic ground motion, showing that it can successfully achieve both life safety (drift reduction) and serviceability (acceleration reduction) objectives at different excitation levels."
800830,14010,9475,Provision of regulation service reserves by flexible distributed loads,2012,"Following our previous work on the control of multiple appliances in response to Independent System Operator (ISO) Regulation Service Signals (RSS), we model the ISO's RSS dynamics - evolving in a time scale of seconds - as a two level Markov process whose transition probabilities are calibrated on actual data. Appliance response is modeled as a Markov modulated process consistent with an exponentially distributed time to switch off and an expected utility that is concave in the price charged when an appliance turns on. Prices are broadcasted dynamically by a Smart Building Operator (SBO) with the objective of maximizing the time average of utility gained when appliances turn on minus the cost of imperfect RSS tracking. We prove certain properties of the stochastic Dynamic Programming (DP) policies that allow us to formulate the problem as an approximate Discrete State and Control Space DP and propose a reasonable approximation that renders the problem scalable to multiple appliance categories. The discretized state DP solution can be obtained as a solution to a Linear Program (LP). The LP provides the optimal dynamic price control policies and in addition yields the requisite information needed by the SBO to bid optimally for energy and Regulation Service Reserve (RSR) Capacity in the hour ahead balancing market. Solving for the discretized real time market optimal price policies, using them to calibrate a continuous analytic policy function, and extracting from the real time optimal policies the optimal bid to the hour ahead forward balancing market is the main contribution of this paper."
797249,14010,11104,Multidimensional tomography with new generation VHR SAR data for urban monitoring,2013,"Research and application is spreading of techniques based on coherent combination of SLC (amplitude and phase) SAR data to extract rich information even on complex observed scenes, fully exploiting existing SAR data archives, and new tandem satellites. Among such techniques, Tomo-SAR stems from multibaseline interferometry to achieve full-3D imaging through elevation beamforming. The Tomo concept has been integrated with differential interferometry, producing the new Differential Tomography (Diff-Tomo) processing mode, that allows “opening” the SAR cells in complex non-stationary scenes, resolving multiple heights and deformation velocities of layover (double) scatterers. In this paper, recent experiments carried out at University of Pisa and at the RaSS Nat. Lab. of the Italian National Consortium for Telecommunications (CNIT), and latest advances are presented of Diff-Tomo techniques for the efficient reconstruction and monitoring of complex urban/infrastructure deformating scenarios with new generation VHR SAR data. In particular, a new 4D Diff-Tomo model-based method with single-look light-burden superresolution capabilities is presented, and validated with COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) data. Also, first investigations of triple scatter detection, and of eigenvalue-based pre-detection are carried out with the CSK data. Finally, a new “5D” Diff-Tomo model-based method for non-uniform motion (thermal dilation) monitoring at superresolution is introduced, and tested. This ensemble of results is the first extensive demonstration of multidimensional superresolution tomographic methodologies for CSK applications."
1919176,14010,20649,Battery Management and Application for Energy-Efficient Buildings,2014,"As the building stock consumes 40% of the U.S. primary energy consumption, it is critically important to improve building energy efficiency. This involves reducing the total energy consumption of buildings, reducing the peak energy demand, and leveraging renewable energy sources, etc. To achieve such goals, hybrid energy supply has becoming popular, where multiple energy sources such as grid electricity, on-site fuel cell generators, solar, wind, and battery storage are scheduled together to improve energy efficiency.   In this work, we focus on the application and management of battery storage for energy-efficient buildings. We will first introduce a system-level approach to co-schedule the usage of battery storage (in addition to grid electricity) with the control of building HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system, to reduce the total building energy cost, including the electricity consumption charge, the peak demand charge, and the battery cost. Then, in a separate formulation, we will introduce another system-level study to reduce the energy cost of EV charging and other fixed building energy load through the usage of battery storage and solar PV. Finally, we will present an ARM processor based programmable embedded battery management system (BMS), which monitors battery status, controls charging and discharging at the circuit level, and provides battery protection. The system also works with off-the-shelf battery management IC (Texas Instrument BMS sensor IC) from industry. Comparing to conventional BMS, this software module based BMS is a more suitable solution for energy-efficient buildings due to its high flexibility, scalability, and reusability.   We will introduce an industrial building testbed with battery storage and solar PV at the University of California, Riverside, and present initial field tests and simulation results for above approaches."
1633203,14010,8441,Robust control design method for uncertain system using a set of measurements,2013,"This work deals with the design of robust fixed-structure controllers for uncertain systems based on a finite set of measured data. This set of measurements is given in the frequency domain. In the current control design approaches, controllers are usually designed based on plant models obtained on the basis of measured data. However, due to various forms of uncertainties such as: plant parameter variations, external disturbances, measurement noise, etc, such models are unable to perfectly describe the behavior of the physical system. Hence, degradation in the controller performance is expected due to such uncertainties and errors associated with the identification process. For that, we propose a new control technique that uses the uncertain measurements to directly design robust controllers, for a class of uncertainties, without going through the use of identification process. In such a proposed design method, interval techniques are introduced to bound plant uncertainties. Its main principle is to find the set of admissible values of the controller parameters so that the family of all possible frequency responses of the closed-loop system lies between an upper and lower bounds of a desired frequency response. This problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem which can easily be solved to characterize the solution set of the controller parameters. The main feature of our proposed approach is that it enables to design robust fixed-structure controllers by taking into account the plant uncertainties. Moreover, since no mathematical model is needed in the controller synthesis, the design process does not depend on the increasing order and complexity of the system. A simulation example is presented to illustrate and validate the efficacy of the proposed method."
1353468,14010,11104,Bistatic SAR experiments with the TanDEM-X constellation,2012,"Launched in June 2010, TanDEM-X is an interferometric mission with the main goal of providing a high-resolution, global and unprecedentedly accurate digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth by means of single-pass X-band SAR interferometry. Despite its usual quasi-monostatic configuration, TanDEM-X is the first genuinely bistatic SAR system in space. During its monostatic commissioning phase, the system was operated in pursuit monostatic mode. During that time, some pioneering bistatic SAR experiments with both satellites commanded in non-nominal modes were conducted with the main purpose of testing the performance of both space and ground segments in very demanding scenarios. In particular, this article includes results of the first bistatic acquisition and the first single-pass interferometric (mono/bistatic) acquisition with TanDEM-X, addressing their innovative aspects and focussing on the analysis of the experimental results. Even in the absence of essential synchronisation and calibration information, bistatic images and interferogramswith similar quality to pursuit monostatic have been obtained. Some months later, with TanDEM-X already in its operational DEM-acquisition phase a further challenging bistatic acquisition carried out in cooperation with DLR's airborne radar F-SAR has been carried out. The objective was to acquire fully polarimetric interferometric data with a high range of available bistatic angles. A dedicated commanding of both TanDEM-X and F-SAR was required, including irregular sampling schemes, partially missing bistatic echo reception and bistatic synchronisation, which pose a number of technological challenges in SAR data processing before the calibrated bistatic SAR images are obtained. This article reports about these two set of experiments."
826443,14010,8441,A measurement-based approach for tuning of reduced-order controllers,2013,"This paper presents a new measurement-based technique to design fixed-structure controllers for unknown SISO systems. Most control design approaches existing in the literature are based on parametric models. Such models can be obtained using physical laws or via system identification using a set of measured data. Model-based control approaches have proven successful only when mathematical models used in the controller design provide a perfect description of the physical system behavior. In many practical situations, it has been shown that the derivation of models using either physical laws or system identification is usually based on simplifying assumptions due to complex dynamics characterizing real systems. Hence, the use of such simplified models in the design process may result in closed-loop performance deterioration. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed to design controllers based on measured data without the need for model identification. Our proposed technique is novel in the sense that it can be applied even when the controller placement within a complex control system configuration is unknown. The principle of the proposed control methodology is to find the controller parameters so that the closed-loop frequency response is close to a desired frequency response. This problem is formulated as an error minimization problem. The main advantages of our proposed approach are: 1) its applicability to any complex and unknown control system configuration and without the use of any mathematical model, and 2) the design process is based on a pre-selected controller structure, which allows for the selection of low-order controllers. For simulation purposes, a PID measurement-based controller is designed to illustrate the feasibility and the efficacy of the proposed technique."
1621830,14010,9475,On stock trading using a PI controller in an idealized market: The robust positive expectation property,2013,"In a number of recent papers, a new line of research has been unfolding which is aimed at using classical linear feedback control in a model-free stock trading context. The salient feature of this approach is that no model for stock price dynamics is used to determine the dollar amount invested I(t). Instead, the investment level is performance driven and generated in a model-free manner via an adaptive feedback on the cumulative gains and losses g(t). One of the main results obtained to date is paraphrased as follows: Under idealized market conditions with stock prices governed by a non-trivial Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), a combination of two static linear feedbacks, one long and one short, leads to a positive expected value for the trading gain g(t) for all t > 0. Since this holds independently of the parameters underlying the GBM process, it is called the “robust positive expectation” property. Working in this same GBM setting, the main objective in this paper is to generalize this result from static to dynamic feedback. To this end, we consider a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller for the investment function I(t). Subsequently, we reduce the stochastic trading equations for the expectation of g(t) to a classical second order system and use the closed- form solution to prove that the robust positive expectation property still holds. We also consider a number of other issues such as the analysis of the variance of g(t) and the monotonic dependence of g(t) on the feedback gains. Finally, we provide simulations showing how the PI controller performs in a real market with prices obtained from historical data."
2414936,14010,11104,Matching of Persistent Scatterers to buildings,2012,"Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) aims at estimating the topography and deformation for a set of sufficiently stable radar targets, referred to as Persistent Scatterers (PS). Thereby, a stack of SAR images is exploited to distinguish between signal of interest and disturbances caused by, for instance, changes of the atmospheric conditions over time. The achievable sampling density mainly depends on the resolution of the employed sensor, and the characteristics of the scene at hand (i.e. the number of sufficiently stable reflectors). In case space-borne SAR data of the highest resolution is used, very high PS densities, potentially enabling the mapping of structures at sub-building level, can be achieved. This offers a big and completely new range of possible applications. For instance, it is possible to monitor single buildings using PSI. But with this also new questions and challenges arise. Two of those would be: which buildings are sampled dense enough for monitoring purposes, and to which actual building structure does the PS correspond? In order to investigate those questions, the PS results are aligned with building outlines. This easily enables to map the PS density of buildings, which partly answers the first question. Admittedly, also the distribution of the PS and the shape of the building as well as its structure play a role. But a map of the PS density would be definitely helpful to assess which structures can be monitored adequately. The correspondence between actual building structures and PS is a good deal harder to answer. In this work, we attempt to improve the geocoding of the PS with the help of the GIS data, in view of the fact that this may be very helpful for the given task."
2184731,14010,20896,Computational-Physical State Co-regulation in Cyber-Physical Systems,2011,"From the perspective of physical system feedback control, the cyber or computer system's role has been to sample and compute control inputs sufficiently fast to maintain acceptable reference command tracking and disturbance rejection in the physical system. This strategy has been successful given the relatively low computational overhead for most control laws compared to computational resource availability. However, in many emerging applications this requirement may be insufficient, not because the computer is incapable of high-speed computations but instead because either more complex computations are required or because processor or network speed must be minimized to conserve energy. We propose the augmentation of traditional physical state models with a computational model to enable a cyber-physical system to co-regulate physical and computational actuation. Ultimately, our goal is to balance resources of the cyber system with quality of control of the physical system to provide a more energy-conscious CPS. As a first step, we propose a continuous-time representation of computational state and derive a continuous dynamics model approximation. Next, we propose the addition of a computational state into the closed-loop control law for the physical system states. Finally, we augment the derived cyber model with a second-order oscillator and demonstrate control via a LQR controller. In our simulation results, computational state and loop execution rate and oscillator force are regulated closed-loop at each control cycle based both on physical and computational state reference commands and errors. Results show that both physical and cyber state can be successfully regulated with the expected degradation in tracking performance as reference computational state (control loop rate) is slowed to values near the stability threshold."
972760,14010,8441,Field testing a wind turbine drivetrain/tower damper using advanced design and validation techniques,2013,"As an ongoing trend, the design of wind turbines is moving towards larger machines with components optimized for cost effectiveness. This leads to very large and flexible structures with lightly damped modes. Good control design is becoming more essential to ensure safe and stable operation over the life of the turbine. Additionally, there is growing interest in expanding the number of sensors and actuators available for closed-loop control. The increasing number of control variables in modern wind turbines will necessitate model-based controller design to handle the complexity of the flexible and coupled control loops in an effective and robust way. Recent literature in wind energy has explored the use of modern control design techniques such as state-space and robust control design methods and closed-loop system identification for model identification. However, this literature is, to date, mostly confined to simulation studies. Field testing is necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced design and validation techniques in a practical application. In this paper, we design two alternative dampers for the lightly damped drivetrain and tower modes of an experimental turbine. One design is based on classical iterative design approaches, while the other uses an H ∞  approach. The two controllers are then validated using two alternative methods: the traditional extended field test and a relatively short system identification experiment. The paper demonstrates that even in this sub-problem of wind turbine control consisting of only two loops, the use of advanced design and validation techniques is very effective at converging quickly to good control designs and quickly assessing their performance."
2294194,14010,20896,Energy efficient navigation management for hybrid electric vehicles on highways,2013,"Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are gaining popularity due to their economical efficiency as well as their contribution to environmental preservation. PHEVs allow the driver to use exclusively electric power for 30-50 miles of driving, and switch to gasoline for longer trips. The more gasoline a vehicle uses, the higher cost is required for the trip. However, a PHEV cannot go long with its stored electricity without being recharged. Thus, it needs frequent recharging as compared to traditional engine vehicles powered by gasoline. Moreover, the battery recharging time is usually long, which leads to longer delays on a trip. Therefore, for the deployment of the PHEV technology it is necessary to provide a flexible navigation management scheme considering an efficient recharging scheduling, which allows choosing an optimal route based on the fuel-cost and time-to-destination constraints. In this paper, we show that this PHEV navigation management problem is  NP-Complete  and present a formal model to solve the problem using  Satisfiability Modulo Theories  (SMT) that provides a vehicle driver a routing plan, as well as the potential charging points that satisfy the requirements (e.g., the maximum fuel cost and the maximum waiting time). We also present a price-based navigation control technique to achieve better load balance for the system. Our evaluations show that the formalization can be efficiently solved even with large sizes of highway topologies and large number of charging stations."
2429395,14010,11104,Modeling permafrost distribution using remote sensing-derived vegetation data in the source region of the Datong River in the northwestern China,2011,"The source region of the Datong River is an inland watershed and located at the northeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. There is relatively plentiful rainfall in the source region. Vegetation, mainly composed of alpine meadow and alpine swamp meadow, developed well and covered mostly the ground surface of the source region. The equivalent-elevation approach has been proved a valid method to evaluate the double effects of latitude and altitude on permafrost in the Qilianshan Mountains, northwestern China. This method was used in this research. The field investigation indicated that vegetation class was an important local factor determining permafrost development and distribution in the study area. According to the vegetation samplings, the Landsat TM images of the source region were interpreted using the maximum likelihood algorism. Ground surface of the study area were classified into three classes, alpine meadow, alpine swamp meadow and the bare ground. According to the classification, boreholes were also divided into three classes correspondingly. As the small amount of boreholes drilled in the bare ground, permafrost distribution in the vegetated areas was studied. By setting up different datum point suitable for different vegetated covering areas, equivalent-elevations of each borehole were calculated. As far as the ground temperatures of permafrost are concerned, the ground temperatures at 15m depth were usually chosen as the proxy of mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) because of the index has a tiny seasonal variation although the large seasonal changes of ambient temperatures. Permafrost models, between permafrost MAGT and the calculated equivalent-elevations, in different vegetated areas were constructed. Using the GIS software combined with the DEM data, permafrost MAGT of the vegetated areas in the source region were computed and mapped. The calculation results indicated that permafrost MAGT varied from −3.1°C to 1.1°C and from −4.6°C to 1.7°C in the alpine swampy meadow and alpine meadow vegetation areas, respectively. The vegetated areas had a variation of permafrost MAGT from −4.6°C to 1.7°C. In the vegetated areas, the areal percentages of permafrost and the seasonally frozen ground were 94% and 6%."
742334,14010,20896,Pack Sizing and Reconfiguration for Management of Large-Scale Batteries,2012,"Battery systems for electric vehicles (EVs) or uninterruptible micro-gridsâprototypical cyber-physical systems (CPSs)âare usually built with several hundreds/thousands of battery cells. How to deal with the inevitable failure of cells quickly and cost-effectively for vehicle warranty or uninterruptible service, for instance, is key to the development of large-scale battery systems. Use of extra (redundant/backup) cells to cope with cell failures must be minimized so as to make the target systems cheaper and lighter, while meeting the reliability requirement that is directly related to, for example, the vehicle warranty. Existing reconfigurable battery systems do not scale well because they incur a long delay in properly setting a large number of switches to bypass faulty cells or adapting to dynamically changing power demands in large battery systems for such applications as EVs. In this paper, we propose a scalable solution, not only to reduce the required number of backup cells and the total cost of a battery system, but also to facilitate recovery from cell failures and adapt to changing power demands while increasing battery utilization. Specifically, we optimize the pack-size by striking a balance between various types of cost in order to reduce the overall cost. We also configure battery packs and optimize their connection topology, reducing delays in failure recovery and power reallocation. Our in-depth evaluation has shown that the time to recover from cell failures remains constant irrespective of the number of cells involved, which is important to scalability. The proposed pack-sizing also reduces the cost and the size of battery systems. Moreover, fast power reallocation is achieved by utilizing prior knowledge of power usage patterns."
959769,14010,9475,(Non-)Bayesian learning without recall,2014,"This work is concerned with the problem of social learning. A network of agents attempt to learn some unknown state of the world which is drawn by nature from a finite set. The sources of information available to the agents are their own private observations as well as the beliefs of their neighboring agents in the social structure in which they interact. The rational approach to the problem of social learning is for each agent to refine her opinion, by using the Bayes' rule to incorporate her neighbors' beliefs and own private signals over time. However, repeated applications of the Bayes' rule in social networks can become computationally intractable, partly due to the fact that each agent needs to use her local data that is increasing over time and make inferences about the global network structure. The inherent complexity of the Bayesian approach has lead to the consideration of behavioral, non-Bayesian updates, where each agent instead of processing all new information in the optimum Bayesian way uses simple rules such as linear or convex combinations and forms updated beliefs. In this paper, it is shown that by replicating the rule that maps the agents' common prior to their Bayesian posterior at the initial time-step for all future steps, one can derive a memoryless Bayesian update that has a log-linear format and can serve as a theoretical justification for some of the non-Bayesian rules suggested in the literature. Convergence and learning under the derived rules are also investigated, and it is shown that while two communicating agents always learn the true state, the beliefs may fail to converge in the general network setting. The proposed approach has the advantage that while preserving some features of the Bayesian inference, they are made tractable."
1989047,14010,11104,A dual-frequency spaceborne SAR mission concept,2013,"Since the 2007 National Academy of Science “Decadal Survey” report “Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond” [1], the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been studying concepts for a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission to determine Earth change in three disciplines - ecosystems, solid earth, and cryospheric sciences. One of the most promising and original concepts involves an innovative international partnership between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Previous NASA concepts had focused on exploiting an L-band array-fed reflector SAR configuration that enabled > 200 km swath at full SAR resolution and full polarimetry simultaneously in order to meet requirements in all three disciplines [2]. The feed where the electronics are housed in this design is relatively compact compared to a planar phased array antenna with similar azimuth resolution capability. This compactness allows for straightforward addition of feed array elements at other frequencies. As the partnership concept with ISRO developed, it became clear that flying dual L- and S-band SAR capabilities, with L-band electronics supplied by NASA and S-band electronics by ISRO, would satisfy science and application requirements of the US and India. A dual-frequency fully polarimetric SAR with the potential for global coverage every 12 days would offer unprecedented capability that researchers could exploit in new and exciting ways."
1702463,14010,11104,An approach to improve hot spot effect for the MODIS BRDF/Albedo algorithm,2013,"The RossThick-LiSparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model has been developped to derive the operational Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/Albedo product due to its simplicity and the underlying physics; however, early research showed that this model deficiency mainly comes from its underestimation of the hotspot directional signatures near the Sun's illumination direction. In this paper, we developed an approach to improve the hot spot effect for the RTLSR model by improving the volumetric scattering kernel with an exponential approximation of the hot spot kernel (Chen and Cihlar, 1997). Compared with the RTLSR model and the further-developed model that modify the hotspot directional signatures of RTLSR model based on the calculation of an overlay function of the intersection of viewed and sunlit leaf areas (Jupp and Strahler, 1991, thereafter named RTJLSR), this newly-corrected model that modifies the hot spot effect of RTLSR model based on the theory of calculation of a canopy gap size distribution function (Chen and Leblanc, 1997, thereafter named RTCLSR) preserves the linear form of kernel-driven model, but flexibly adjust hotspot magnitude and width through two additional parameters C1 and C2. Initial validation result with airborne cloud absorption radiometer (CAR) data shows that the RTCLSR model can significantly improve the model-observation fits in hotspot region. In near future, we will focus on determining C1/C2 values from spaceborne POLDER BRDF database provided by the POSTEL Service Centre. With C1/C2 are predetermined, the newly-correctly RTCLSR model is promissing for global application with a minor update from the RTLSR model."
2015198,14010,11104,Estimating the ground heightwith L-band IfSAR in a wind-blown forest environment,2013,"The horizontal and vertical (3D) structure of Earth's forested ecosystems are of great significance to their ecological functioning and societal uses. An IfSAR approach is one methodology whereby a forest's structure and height in particular can be successfully estimated. Critical to the successful estimation is a high correlation between multiple SAR images. Regardless of a forest's location on the Earth, motion due to wind can significantly alter a forest's appearance to a radar system operating at L-band and so too decrease this necessary correlation. In order to investigate and quantize the decorrelation induced by the wind, we have developed a model that is capable of generating both a single-pass and repeat-pass interferometric SAR response of a forest including the application of a randomly oriented wind field. The simulation consists of multiple interconnected parts including the generation of fractal tree geometries, a wind simulator to apply variable wind forces to the generated trees, an electromagnetic model to allow us to calculate a fully polarimetric Single Look Complex value for the SAR return of the combined target, and an IfSAR processing algorithm capable of calculating a scattering phase center in the presence of wind. Results present polarimetric scattering phase centers and interferogram coherence as a function of wind speed. We further deconstruct our SAR processor to yield individual scatting mechanisms and their resultant scattering phase centers. This deconstruction allows for an accurate estimate of the underlying ground to be generated, even in the presence of a strong wind field."
1703451,14010,8441,A model predictive Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control approach,2013,"Reduction of fuel consumption is one of the primary goals of modern automotive engineering. While in the past the focus was on more efficient engine design and control there is an upcoming interest on economic context aware control of the complete vehicle. Technical progress will enable future vehicles to interact with other traffic participants and the surrounding infrastructure, collecting information which allow for reduction of fuel consumption by predictive vehicle control strategies. The principle of Model Predictive Control allows a straightforward integration of e.g. navigation systems, on-board radar sensors, V2V- and V2I-communication whilst regarding constraints and dynamic of the system. This paper presents a Linear Model Predictive Control approach to Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control, directly minimizing the fuel consumption rather than the acceleration of the vehicle. To this end the nonlinear static fuel consumption map of the internal combustion engine is included into the control design by a piecewise quadratic approximation. Inclusion of a linear spacing policy prevents rear end collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the fuel and road capacity benefits, for a single vehicle and for a string of vehicles, equipped with the proposed control, in comparison to vehicles operated by a non-cooperative adaptive cruise control. Full information on the speed prediction of the predecessor is assumed, hence the purpose of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, best achievable benefits, of the proposed control, due to perfect prediction are demonstrated. On the other hand, the paper studies the behavior of the considered control and the influence of the prediction horizon."
1024480,14010,20896,Rhythmic Tasks: A New Task Model with Continually Varying Periods for Cyber-Physical Systems,2012,"Traditional mechanical subsystems in automobiles are being replaced by electronically controlled systems, often with no mechanical backup. This trend towards drive-by-wire systems is becoming increasingly popular. In these cyber-physical systems, a critical task not meeting its timing deadline can lead to a safety violation and damage to life and/or property. Classical real-time scheduling techniques such as RMS and EDF can be used to guarantee the schedulability of periodic tasks. However, certain critical tasks like the engine control task are activated by engine events such as pulses generated by sensors at the engine crankshaft. The periods of these engine tasks vary continually and even dramatically depending on the engine speed. The conventional periodic task model is inadequate for handling such tasks in cyber-physical systems due to its pessimism when combined with common schedulability analyses. In this paper, we define a new task model called Rhythmic Tasks for tasks having periods that vary due to external physical events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that considers continually varying periods for fixed-priority scheduling in dynamic operating environments. We formally define the rhythmic task model and study its scheduling properties. In the context of rhythmic engine control tasks, we offer schedulability tests for determining the maximum possible utilization under the steady state, which is related to the physical engine speed. We also investigate the range of possible engine acceleration and deceleration rates. We show that excessive acceleration and deceleration can make the system unschedulable. We provide algorithms to find the appropriate ranges for acceleration and deceleration rates. We use a specific case study of engine control to illustrate our analysis."

SGLI (Second Generation GLI) onboard GCOM-C (Climate) satellite, which is one of this mission, provides an optical sensor from Near-UV to TIR. Characteristic specifications of SGLI are as follows; 1) 250m resolutions over land and area along the shore, 2) Three directional polarization observation (red and NIR), and 3) 500m resolutions temperature over land and area along shore. SGLI has a set of along track slant viewing Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer (VNR). These multi-angular views aim to detect the structural information from vegetation canopy, especially forest canopy, for estimating productivity of the vegetation. SGLI Land science team has been developing the algorithm for above ground biomass, canopy roughness index, shadow index, etc. In this paper, we introduce SGLI characteristics and the ground observation method developed by using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in order to contribute the algorithm development and its validation. Mainly, multi-angular spectral observation method and simple BRF model have been developed for estimating slant view response of forest canopy. The BRF model developed by using multi-angular measurement has been able to obtain structural information from vegetation canopy. In addition, we have conducted some observation campaigns on typical forest in Japan in collaboration with other science team experienced with vegetation phenology and carbon flux measurement. Primary results of these observations are also be demonstrated."
1629910,14010,9475,How useful are mean-variance considerations in stock trading via feedback control?,2012,"In classical finance, when a stochastic investment outcome is characterized in terms of its mean and variance, it is implicitly understood that the underlying probability distribution is not heavily skewed. For example, in the “perfect” case when outcomes are normally distributed, mean-variance considerations tell the entire story. The main point of this paper is that mean-variance based measures of performance may be entirely inappropriate when a feedback control law is used instead of buy-and-hold to modulate one's stock position as a function of time. For example, when using a feedback gain K to increment or decrement one's stock position, we see that the resulting skewness measure S(K) for the trading gains or losses can easily become dangerously large. Hence, we argue in this paper that the selection of this gain K based on a classical mean-variance based utility function can lead to a distorted picture of the prospects for success. To this end, our analysis begins in a so-called idealized market with prices generated by Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). In addition to the “red flag” associated with skewness, a controller efficiency analysis is also brought to bear. While all feedback gains K lead to efficient (non-dominated, Pareto optimal) controllers, in the mean-variance sense, we show that the same does not hold true when we use a return-risk pair which incorporates more information about the probability distribution for gains and losses. To study the efficiency issue in an application context, the paper also includes a simulation for Pepsico Inc. using the last five years of historical data."

Since there are lots of demands to significantly improve its performances depending on better control schemes, it is valuable to answer the question: how much of the performance it might improve if more advanced control strategies could be used. In addition, various modeling work has been done in the past twenty years. However, there are few new papers showing controller design based on these models and improving its performances effectively. This paper presented the complete mathematical description of the control problem firstly and revealed the critical points in the model of the whole process which significantly affect the control strategy design. Then it explained why most feedback strategies ordinarily used lose their theoretical foundations and few existing control algorithms can be directly used for this control problem with RMS valued current as the output and input constraints. Moreover, a practical control strategy with solid theoretical support was proposed, which seems to be simple but actually with lots of complicated theoretical issues concerned and is one of the few reasonable control algorithms considering the unique properties of RSW's “single phase AC model, input constraints and nonlinearity of the output”. In the end, this paper verified the proposed scheme against the experimental results, and introduced a new interesting general control problem for later researches."
2136765,14010,11104,Interferometric processing of TanDEM-X data,2011,"Since July 2010, TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X jointly acquire interferometric data. Starting their common commissioning phase with a so called pursuit monostatic configuration with 3 seconds time lag between the two passes, they were later put in a close formation in October 2010, acting since then as the first freely configurable bistatic SAR interferometer in space. All operational acquisitions were processed from instrument raw data to DEMs from day one of the data taking on by one single processing system: the Integrated TanDEM-X Processor (ITP) (see [1],[2]). Data take analysis, common parameter calculation, synchronization, bistatic focusing, filtering, co-registration, phase unwrapping and geocoding are all performed in one sequence inside this processor. This approach allows a high precision processing by passing all applied corrections and determined parameters from one step to the next. Specifically the geometric & phase accuracy and stability of the instruments, the processor and the auxiliary data (i.e. the millimetric precision of the baseline products) provide an unprecedented level of relative and absolute geometric accuracy in the bistatic operation. While many challenges of bistatic processing of the TanDEM-X data are encountered, the benefits of this single pass acquisition mode can be used to derive additional information from the data itself for further processing and calibration. In this paper, we will outline the bistatic interferometric processing steps of the ITP and focus on the aspects of geometric accuracy in DEM generation."
1336193,14010,9475,Event triggered signalling codecs for molecular estimation,2013,"Low molecule numbers and intrinsically noisy, coupled stochastic chemical reactions are common in cell biology. For such environments, [12] showed that the accuracy with which molecular populations can be estimated and controlled can be bounded from below by regarding molecular coupling as an information transfer across a finite capacity Poisson channel. In conjunction with a diffusion approximation for the target species, this leads to a clear distortion bound for arbitrary signal-target molecular coupling. For static signal-target coupling, sharp, biologically relevant bounds result, which appear to still hold for the original discrete system. However, when arbitrary non-linear, dynamic coupling is allowed, [13] showed that event-triggered codecs can be constructed that are capable of outperforming the general diffusion bound, both for estimation and control. This paper extends the estimation results from [13] to various molecular signalling topologies and integer encoders. It is found that the bound can be outperformed across all serial and parallel networks by a M|M|1 queue type codec, which is likely optimal for a single stage, over a small parameter regime. Outside this regime queueing delay leads to increasingly worse estimation. The application of integer coding variants in an attempt to improve stability and increase the regime of good performance is largely fruitless, thus indicating that even the simplest non-trivial estimation problem cannot be solved with intuitively sensible codecs."
1783173,14010,11104,Multiresolution fusion using contourlet transform based edge learning,2011,"In this paper, we propose a new approach for multi-resolution fusion of remotely sensed images based on the contourlet transform based learning of high frequency edges. We obtain a high spatial resolution (HR) and high spectral resolution multi-spectral (MS) image using the available high spectral but low spatial resolution MS image and the Panchromatic (Pan) image. Since we need to predict the missing high resolution pixels in each of the MS images the problem is posed in a restoration framework and is solved using maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. Towards this end, we first obtain an initial approximation to the HR fused image by learning the edges from the Pan image using the contourlet transform. A low resolution model is used for the MS image formation and the texture of the fused image is modeled as a homogeneous Markov random field (MRF) prior. We then optimize the cost function which is formed using the data fitting term and the prior term and obtain the fused image, in which the edges correspond to those in the initial HR approximation. The procedure is repeated for each of the MS images. The advantage of the proposed method lies in the use of simple gradient based optimization for regularization purposes while preserving the discontinuities. This in turn reduces the computational complexity since it avoids the use of computationally taxing optimization methods for discontinuity preservation. Also, the proposed method has minimum spectral distortion as we are not using the actual Pan digital numbers, instead learn the texture using contourlet coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by conducting experiments on real satellite data captured by Quickbird satellite."
1872151,14010,9475,A robust MPC/ISM hierarchical multi-loop control scheme for robot manipulators,2013,"In this paper, we propose a robust hierarchical multi-loop control scheme aimed at solving motion control problems for robot manipulators. The kernel of the proposed control scheme is the inverse dynamics-based feedback linearized robotic MIMO system. A first loop is closed relying on an Integral Sliding Mode (ISM) controller, so that matched disturbances and uncertain terms due to unmodelled dynamics, which are not rejected by the inverse dynamics approach, are suitably compensated. An external loop based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimizes the evolution of the controlled system in the respect of state and input constraints. The motivation for using ISM, apart from its property of providing robustness to the scheme in front of a significant class of uncertainties, is also given by its capability of enforcing sliding modes of the controlled system since the initial time instant, which is a clear advantage in the considered case, allowing one to solve the model predictive control optimization problem relying on a set of linearized decoupled SISO systems which are not affected by uncertain terms. As a consequence, a standard MPC can be used and the resulting control scheme is characterized by a low computational load with respect to conventional nonlinear robust solutions. The verification and the validation of our proposal have been carried out with satisfactory results in simulation, relying on a model of an industrial robot manipulator with injected noise, to better emulate a realistic set up. Both the model and the noise have been identified on the basis of real data."
1564752,14010,11104,Modeling and simulation of bin-bin correlations in GNSS-R waveforms,2012,"Reflected signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS-R) can be used as a source of illumination for bistatic radar remote sensing of the ocean surface. When cross-correlated with a replica of the transmitted signal, the resulting waveform will have a shape dependent upon the slope distribution of the random rough surface. Substantial data from airborne experiments with GPS exist and have been used to demonstrate the feasibility of GPS reflectometry for ocean remote sensing. The available data from satellite receivers, or any experiments using signals with other modulations, such as Galileo, however, is much scarcer. In order to predict the performance of future spaceborne GNSS-R experiments, and to evaluate the utility of including BOC-modulated signals from Galileo and the modernized GPS in reflectometry measurements, a capability for generating synthetic GNSS-R waveforms has been under development. Individual waveforms are produced by cross-correlating a short block of reflected signal with a model signal over many delay-Doppler bins. As the receiver moves relative to the scattering surface, this cross-correlation is repeated in time, over subsequent blocks of reflected data. Noisy waveforms are thus correlated in time. Samples of the waveform at a given instant in time are also correlated with other samples at same time, but computed at different delays. A realistic simulator, producing synthetic data which accurately represents the statistics of observed signals, must properly account for these correlations. In this presentation, a model for the second effect, the correlation between waveform samples at different delays (or between —) is modeled and implemented into a simulator."
2260290,14010,11104,Radiative impact of biomass burning events: the October 2010 smoke episode in South-East Asia,2012,"Over the past two decades, the Asia and South-Asia region has experienced a dramatic economic, industrial and population grow. Big cities are becoming large emission sources of anthropogenic aerosols resulting from the incessant industrial activity. In rural areas, clearance of large forested areas, via the method of burning, has resulted in severe smoke emission episodes during the 1996–2006 decade and has become an annual phenomenon specially in the South-East-Asia region. Large emission episodes can occur during periods of severe draught and exacerbated by the inter- annual El Nino events. Depending on weather patterns, smoke events can evolve into a persistent trans-boundary smoke with aerosol concentrations high enough to significantly reduce visibility and become a health hazard for local populations. During the month of October 2010, elevated levels of fire activity was detected by remote sensing satellites as well as by local in-situ measurements of fine particulate matter. In this work, we investigate the radiative impact of this smoke episode by firstly, analyzing the physical and optical properties of smoke particles with the aid of passive (Sun-photometer, AERONET), active and in-situ sampling of fine particulate (PM2.5) at our Singapore receptor site. Secondly, inversions of particle size distribution as well as single scattering albedo were used to evaluate the radiative impact of this biomass burning episode."
1593510,14010,11104,Statistical emulation of high-resolution SAR wind fields from low-resolution model predictions,2014,"This paper addresses the reconstruction of high-resolution (HR) sea surface wind fields (typically, at a spatial reso- lution of 1 km). The availability of such HR fields is critical for numerous issues, e.g. coastal management, offshore structures, oil spill disaster tracking, etc. Satellites, especially from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems, can monitor the ocean surface at a spatial resolution of a few meters. SAR wind fields are operationally produced with spatial resolutions of less than 1 km [1, 2]. However, satellite SAR systems involve a highly irregular sampling of the ocean surface and, for a given region, SAR wind fields may be delivered with a low temporal resolution, typically every 7-to-10 days for temperate zones. By contrast, model predictions, such as European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) wind fields, are typically delivered with a high temporal resolution (e.g. every 3 h), but with a low spatial resolution (∼50 km × 50 km). The question of the combination of numerical model predictions and SAR wind fields naturally arises to deliver HR wind fields at sea surface anywhere and anytime. Here, we state this issue as the statistical learning of transfer functions between low-resolution (LR) model predictions and the associated HR SAR fields. We investigate the extent to which such regression functions can be learnt from a set of co-located HR and LR fields. Both local and non-local schemes as well as linear and non- linear regression methods are considered. As a case-study, we carry out numerical experiments for a coastal area off Norway, which involves complex LR-to-HR situations."
2077235,14010,11104,Interoperability of radar and optical data for forest information assessment.,2011,"The contribution of the world's forested ecosystems to the global carbon budget is well recognized. Increasingly however, we see the ongoing depletion of forest stocks, biomass burning and land cover change; key contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately climate change. Through international agreements such as UNFCCC REDD, individual country's are charged with a greater responsibility to account for carbon gains and losses, a move which may spur improved management and more sustainable use of forest and natural resources. With such variability in forest and land cover dynamics, individual country's Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems must adapt to detect extensive clearing or more subtle change at the landscape level. The acquisition of both optical and radar remotely sensed data at moderate spatial resolution has, and will continue to support regional assessment of forest and land cover change. In this paper we investigate the interoperability of optical and radar data acquired over Tasmania, Australia, for forest information monitoring. The fundamental requirement of an initial baseline from which subsequent change can be measured is outlined. Classification methodologies and forest cover estimates over the timeframe of image acquisition are presented. The independent and combined use of optical and radar data for forest extent mapping, with the emphasis on processing time-series data, is discussed. The methodologies presented in this paper are robust, consistent over a time-series and issues surrounding interoperability are globally applicable."
1858976,14010,11104,Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Data Mining (DM) in Landsat time series for mapping soybean in intensive agricultural regions,2012,"Soya is a widely grown crop in many countries worldwide, being United States, Brazil, Argentina and China the major producers. In Brazil, in the last three decades an explosive growth in production has occurred, nearly thirty times, causing a chain of unprecedent changes of land uses and land cover (LULC) in the territory. Therefore, it becomes highly necessary to develop means to monitor such LULC changes, and remote sensing is one of the more potential tools for this monitoring. Thus, the aim of this research was to develop a methodology for contributing in the mapping and monitoring soybeans planted areas, with time-series of remotely sensed Landsat imagery. Two main techniques were combined: Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Data Mining (DM). OBIA was used to represent the knowledge needed to map soybeans areas, and DM was applied to generate the knowledge model. The study area comprises three municipalities in the northwest of Sao Paulo State, being this area well representative of the agricultural conditions of the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil. Classification accuracy was calculated over a set of 500 points not previously used during the training stage. The statistics indicated an overall accuracy of 95% and a kappa coefficient of 0.88.These results indicate that the combination of OBIA + DM + multitemporal imagery is very efficient and promising for the soybeans mapping process."
1745942,14010,11104,Effect of bandwidth of panchromatic image on the quality of pansharpened multispectral image,2013,"Preservation of the spectral characteristics in multispectral images is important in the development of pansharpening methods because it affects the accuracy of subsequent applications, such as visual interpretation, land cover classification, and change detection. The combinations of the spectral properties (observation wavelength and width of spectral bands) of multispectral and panchromatic images affect both the spatial and spectral quality of pansharpened images. Therefore, the clarification of the relations between spectral bands and quality of pansharpened image is important for improving our understanding of pansharpening methods, and for developing better schemes for image fusion. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of bandwidth of panchromatic image on the spectral quality of pansharpened multispectral image by the simulation using hyperspectral data. Fifty-four panchromatic images with shifting bandwidths were generated using airborne hyperspectral data by averaging of different band combinations. Four bands of multispectral images were generated similarly from hyperspectral data, and spatially degraded by a factor of 6 in order to simulate low-resolution images. The pansharpened multispectral images were produced from these multispectral and panchromatic data by means of 5 pansharpening methods. The results were evaluated by the comparison with the non-degraded multispectral bands both qualitatively by visual assessment, and quantitatively by statistical index ERGAS. Quality of near infrared band was worse than visible bands, mainly due to the spectral position of panchromatic band in visible wave region. It was, however, gradually improved as longer bandwidth of panchromatic band that was expanded into near infrared region. Gram-Schmidt Spectral Sharpening generated somewhat better quality among the method from the view point of ERGAS. It was concluded that wider spectral bandwidth resulted in balanced quality of images in all bands, though the appearances of images are rather dissimilar to the original."
1581186,14010,11104,Water information system platforms addressing critical societal needs in the MENA region,2012,"The MENA region includes 18 countries, the occupied Palestinian territories and Western Sahara. However, the region of interest for this study has a strategic interest in countries adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea, which includes, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan. The 90% of the water in the MENA region 1  is used for the agriculture use. By the end of this century 2 , this region is projected to experience an increase of 3°C to 5°C in mean temperatures and a 20% decline in precipitation (IPCC, 2007). Due to lower precipitation, water run-off is projected to drop by 20% to 30% in most of MENA by 2050 3 . Reduced stream flow and groundwater recharge might lead to a reduction in water supply of 10% or greater by 2050. Therefore, per IPCC projections in temperature rise and precipitation decline in the region, the scarcity of water4 will become more acute with population growth, and rising demand of food in the region. Additionally, the transboundary water issues will continue to plague the region in terms of sharing data for better management of water resources. Such pressing issues have brought The World Bank, USAID and NASA to jointly collaborated for establishing integrated, modern, up to date NASA developed capabilities for countries in the MENA region for addressing water resource issues and adapting to climate change impacts for improved decision making and societal benefit. This initiative was launched in October 2011 and is schedule to be completed by the end of 2015."
1845061,14010,11104,Mapping dynamic wetland processes with a one year RADARSAT-2 quad pol time-series,2011,"Remotely sensed data are widely used to identify, delineate and characterize wetlands. Optical data provide interesting information on land-use and land cover but are limited to cloud-free periods and to a description of the top layer of the vegetation strata because penetration depth is very small. For these reasons, it is not possible to precisely inventory wetland vegetation and agricultural practices, as well as water cycles and water levels in these areas with passive remote sensing techniques. The objective of this article is to evaluate fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 time-series datasets to determine the water cycle dynamics, in order to delineate precisely potential, effective and efficient wetlands. To that end, the development and validation of a supervised PolSAR segmentation including multi-temporal analysis of wetland evolution, and the investigation of polarimetric decomposition methods for quantitative physical parameter inversion algorithms are presented. The proposed methodology is based on the segmentation of a polarimetric descriptor, the Shannon Entropy, which has been shown to be a very sensitive parameter to the temporal variability of flooded areas. The results have been validated using soil moisture measurements in the field and a LiDAR image. They show that it is possible to produce detailed water feature maps useful for delineating water tables as well as water-saturated areas, and for monitoring water area dynamics. These products provide useful information to identify and delineate wetlands in order to support conservation and management in these ecosystems across large areas."
1829463,14010,23836,Vitis: A Gossip-based Hybrid Overlay for Internet-scale Publish/Subscribe Enabling Rendezvous Routing in Unstructured Overlay Networks,2011,"Peer-to-peer overlay networks are attractive solutions for building Internet-scale publish/subscribe systems. However, scalability comes with a cost: a message published on a certain topic often needs to traverse a large number of uninterested (unsubscribed) nodes before reaching all its subscribers. This might sharply increase resource consumption for such relay nodes (in terms of bandwidth transmission cost, CPU, etc) and could ultimately lead to rapid deterioration of the system's performance once the relay nodes start dropping the messages or choose to permanently abandon the system. In this paper, we introduce {\em Vitis}, a gossip-based publish/subscribe system that significantly decreases the number of relay messages, and scales to an unbounded number of nodes and topics. This is achieved by the novel approach of enabling rendezvous routing on unstructured overlays. We construct a hybrid system by injecting structure into an otherwise unstructured network. The resulting structure resembles a navigable small-world network, which spans along clusters of nodes that have similar subscriptions. The properties of such an overlay make it an ideal platform for efficient data dissemination in large-scale systems. We perform extensive simulations and evaluate Vitis by comparing its performance against two base-line publish/subscribe systems: one that is oblivious to node subscriptions, and another that exploits the subscription similarities. Our measurements show that Vitis significantly outperforms the base-line solutions on various subscription and churn scenarios, from both synthetic models and real-world traces."
1526711,14010,9475,Duration-differentiated energy services with a continuum of loads,2014,"The problem of balancing supply and demand in the power grid becomes more challenging with the integration of uncertain and intermittent renewable supply. The usual scheme of supply following load may not be appropriate for large penetration levels of renewable supply. The reason is the increased level of reserves required to maintain a reliable grid, which affects both operational costs (reserves are expensive) and the environmental benefits of renewables (on-line reserves might increase CO 2  emissions). An alternative paradigm is to use demand side flexibility for power balance. In this paper, we focus on one particular way of exploiting the demand side flexibility. We consider a group of loads with each load requiring a constant power level for a specified duration within an operational period. The loads are differentiated in terms of the duration of service they require. The flexibility of a load resides in the fact that the power delivery may occur at any subset of the total operational period. We consider the problems of scheduling, control and market implementation for a continuum of these loads. If the loads and the available power are known in advance, we find conditions under which the available power can service all the loads, and we describe an algorithm that constructs an appropriate allocation. In the event the available supply is inadequate, we characterize the minimum amount of power that must be purchased to service the loads. In addition, we investigate the implementation of a forward market in which consumers can purchase duration differentiated services. We first characterize the social welfare maximization problem and then show the existence of an efficient competitive equilibrium in this forward market."
751716,14010,9475,Cooperative navigation for heterogeneous autonomous vehicles via approximate dynamic programming,2011,"Unmanned ground and aerial vehicles are becoming crucial to many applications because of their ability to assist humans in carrying out dangerous missions. These vehicles can be viewed as networks of heterogeneous unmanned robotic sensors with the goal of exploring complex environments, to search for and, possibly, pursue moving targets. The robotic vehicle performance can be greatly enhanced by implementing future sensor actions intelligently, based both on prior knowledge and on the information obtained by the sensors on line. In this paper, we present an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach to cooperative navigation for heterogeneous sensor networks. The mobile sensor network consists of a set of robotic sensors modeled as hybrid systems with processing capabilities. The goal of the ADP algorithm is to coordinate a team of heterogeneous autonomous vehicles (i.e., ground robot and quadrotor UAV) to navigate within an obstacle populated environment while satisfying collision avoidance constraints and searching for stationary and mobile targets. It is assumed that the ground vehicle has a small sensor footprint with high resolution. The quadrotor, on the other hand, has a large sensor field-of-view but low resolution. The UAV provides a low resolution look-ahead map to the ground robot which in turn uses this information to plan its actions. The proposed navigation strategy combines artificial potential functions for target pursuing with ADP for learning C-obstacles on line. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is verified through numerical simulations."
1460858,14010,11104,Satellite sensor intercalibration over Dome C: An introduction to QA4EO and the ESA GlobAlbedo project,2012,"In this paper, the response of 7 Earth observation satellite sensors from multiple platforms, as well as different sensors on the same platform, are cross-compared over the Dome C plateau, Antarctica, during the austral summer of 2008–2009. A single, unified methodology is employed to remove geometric, temporal and atmospheric biases between different sensors with a range of spatial resolutions, bandwidths and overpass times. The result assumes no “correct” baseline value, only relative responses. The method is derived from an in-depth sensitivity analysis, presented elsewhere [1], [2], that takes into account: BRDF effect, cloud cover, macro-scale hoar-frost change and variations in atmospheric pressure, temperature and composition, including water vapour, ozone and aerosol content variation with altitude. The resulting responses of the sensors: AATSR, AVNIR-2, ETM+ (Landsat 7), MERIS, NigeriaSat-1, VEGETATION 2 and UK-DMC-1 are presented, and where overlap occurs, compared with the results from other groups [3], [4], [5]. In addition to introducing the QA4EO protocols for the quality assurance of environmental monitoring satellites, this paper also discusses several sensors used to establish the technical basis of the ESA GlobAlbedo project: an open access, validated, 15 year long record of broadband land surface albedo (both snow and snow-free) from European sensors alone [6]."
1203035,14010,8441,Low cost underwater gliders for littoral marine research,2013,"Current off-the-shelf underwater gliders (UGs) are large, heavy, expensive, and difficult to modify, both in hardware and software, which limits their use for multivehicle coordination experiments and deployment in high risk environments. To address these challenges, the Nonlinear and Autonomous Systems Laboratory (NAS Lab) at Michigan Tech has designed two types of UGs for concept development, testing, and problem solving, and additionally, for scaffolding advanced interest and education in engineering. The first, a Glider for Underwater Presentation and Promoting Interest in Engineering (GUPPIE), nationally targets high school students and undergraduates to provide these students a UG platform for hands-on experience in concept development, testing, and problem solving. The second platform is a Glider for Autonomous Littoral Underwater Research (GALUR). At 10% of the cost of current models, the GALUR was designed to serve as a low cost multivehicle control testbed for disparate research groups who need to test and validate control algorithms. Still a highly-maneuverable UG, the GALUR allows researchers to address underwater communication issues by implementing control strategies for individual and multiple vehicle underwater data collection and mapping. Through the process of developing and testing these two UGs, the research team is ultimately working toward their long term goal of developing a fleet of low cost highly maneuverable underwater gliders. This paper details the challenges and milestones of the development process, and outlines the future research trajectory and goals."
1165081,14010,9475,Nonlinear analysis of a grid-connected photovoltaic/dc-load system driven by local current-mode controllers,2014,"A distributed power generation system controlled through the duty-ratio inputs of the power converters used to interface a photovoltaic source and the ac-grid to a common bus is considered. For the control design, the standard local cascaded scheme is adopted for each individual input while nonlinear stability analysis is deployed for the complete system. To this end, a model integration is proposed that includes all the power system units along with suitable current-mode, inner-loop fast controllers. Taking into account some basic features of the complete nonlinear forced model, the analysis it is proposed to follow a new sequential method for proving stability. In the first step, an easily obtained storage function is utilized as it is constructed from the passivity property. In the second step, taking into account the cascaded system form, a complementary storage function is provided that substantially upgrades the initial storage function in a manner capable for proving input-to-state stability. Additionally, using an advanced LaSalle-based technique, convergence to the equilibrium is proven. Hence, in this paper, a novel nonlinear method is developed to prove that slightly modifying the conventional current-mode controllers these can be used in a decentralized local scheme without creating contradictions on the system performance since stability is guaranteed. Simulation and some experimental results are finally conducted to confirm the controller design and system analysis."
1722439,14010,9475,Iterative fault tolerant control based on Stochastic Distribution,2011,"A new design of a fault tolerant control (FTC)-based an adaptive, fixed-structure PI controller, with constraints on the state vector for nonlinear discrete-time system subject to stochastic non-Gaussian disturbance is studied. The objective of the reliable control algorithm scheme is to design a control signal such that the actual probability density function (PDF) of the system is made as close as possible to a desired PDF, and make the tracking performance converge to zero, not only when all components are functional but also in case of admissible faults. A Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI)-based FTC method is presented to ensure that the fault can be estimated and compensated for. A radial basis function (RBF) neural network is used to approximate the output PDF of the system. Thus, the aim of the output PDF control will be a RBF weight control with an adaptive tuning of the basis function parameters. The key issue here is to divide the control horizon into a number of equal time intervals called batches. Within each interval, there are a fixed number of sample points. The design procedure is divided into two main algorithms, within each batch, and between any two adjacent batches. A P-type ILC law is employed to tune the parameters of the RBF neural network so that the PDF tracking error decreases along with the batches. Sufficient conditions for the proposed fault tolerance are expressed as LMIs. An analysis of the ILC convergence is carried out. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with an illustrated example."
2064913,14010,11104,Orbiting Arid Subsurface and Ice Sheet Sounder (OASIS): Exploring desert aquifers and polar ice sheets and their role in current and paleo-climate evolution,2013,"The Orbiting Arid Subsurface and Ice Sheet Sounder (OASIS) mission concept is the first to directly explore the signatures of climate change beneath the surface of two of the least well-understood arid regions of the Earth: the polar ice sheets and the hyper-arid deserts (Figure 1). With these first-of-a-kind measurements of land ice and shallow aquifers, OASIS has two well-defined science objectives. The first is to determine the thickness, inner structure, and basal boundary conditions of Earth's ice sheets to understand their dynamics and to improve models of current and future ice sheet response to climate change and, hence, to better constrain ice sheet contribution to sea level rise. The second objective is to perform detailed mapping of the spatial distribution of shallow (<;100 m deep) aquifers in the most arid regions on Earth to understand groundwater hydrology, enhance groundwater flow models, and provide new insights into available water resources and paleoclimatic conditions. These two mission objectives, which align closely with two NASA Earth Science program objectives on climate and water cycle, are achieved using measurements made by a single, low-cost and proven-heritage instrument: a 45 MHz center frequency radar sounder with 10 MHz bandwidth. The OASIS radar is similar to instruments on two successful Mars missions, Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, presently probing the Martian subsurface."
944036,14010,8441,Identification of affine linear parameter varying models for adaptive interventions in fibromyalgia treatment,2013,"There is good evidence that naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has a strong neuroprotective role and may be a potential drug for the treatment of fibromyalgia. In previous work, some of the authors used experimental clinical data to identify input-output linear time invariant models that were used to extract useful information about the effect of this drug on fibromyalgia symptoms. Additional factors such as anxiety, stress, mood, and headache, were considered as additive disturbances. However, it seems reasonable to think that these factors do not affect the drug actuation, but only the way in which a participant perceives how the drug actuates on herself. Under this hypothesis the linear time invariant models can be replaced by State-Space Affine Linear Parameter Varying models where the disturbances are seen as a scheduling signal signal only acting at the parameters of the output equation. In this paper a new algorithm for identifying such a model is proposed. This algorithm minimizes a quadratic criterion of the output error. Since the output error is a linear function of some parameters, the Affine Linear Parameter Varying system identification is formulated as a separable nonlinear least squares problem. Likewise other identification algorithms using gradient optimization methods several parameter derivatives are dynamical systems that must be simulated. In order to increase time efficiency a canonical parametrization that minimizes the number of systems to be simulated is chosen. The effectiveness of the algorithm is assessed in a case study where an Affine Parameter Varying Model is identified from the experimental data used in the previous study and compared with the time-invariant model."

Since the very first interferometric acquisitions, the Integrated TanDEM-X Processor (ITP) delivered operationally “Raw”-DEMs and complex products of mono- and bistatic data. The RawDEMs are scenes of about 50km × 30km, generated for a dedicated DEM Mosaicking and Calibration Processor (MCP) which produces the final DEM. The so-called Coregistered Single-look Slant-range Complex (CoSSC) products are provided for each of these scenes in different flavors for production internal purposes and system performance monitoring as well as for scientific use. The capabilities of the ITP go far beyond the primary mission objective of DEM generation alone: it also provides the operationally available end-user products from different experimental modes as e.g. pursuit monostatic, dual polarization bistatic data, alternating bistatic in single and dual polarization and different bistatic and alternating bistatic spotlight modes.

809820,14010,9475,Hybrid model reduction for compressible flow controller design,2011,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been a powerful simulation tool to gain insight and understanding of fluid dynamic systems. However, it is also extremely computationally intensive and thus unsuitable for control design and iteration. Various model reduction schemes have been proposed in the past to approximate the Navier-Stokes equation with a low-dimensional model. There are essentially two approaches: input/output model identification and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The former captures mostly the local behavior near a steady state and the latter is highly dependent on the snapshots of the flow state used to extract the projection. This paper presents a hybrid model reduction approach that attempts to combine the best features of the two approaches. We first identify an input/output linear model by using the subspace identification method. We next project the difference between CFD response and the identified model response onto a set of POD basis. This trajectory is then fit to a nonlinear dynamical model to augment the input/output linear model. The resulting hybrid model is then used for control design with the controller evaluated with CFD. The proposed methodology has been applied to a 2D compressible flow passing a contraction geometry. The result indicates that near the steady state used for linear system identification, the linear system based design works well. However, far away from the steady state, the hybrid system shows much better performance."
1764796,14010,11104,Review of the image reconstruction techniques used in SMOS data processing,2012,"The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission by ESA has been delivering Level 1 data to the Level 2 users since 2010. The Level 1 processing is divided in three levels: Level 1a, comprising the conversion of the raw data from MIRAS into calibrated visibilities; Level 1b, where the calibrated visibilities are corrected from the effects of unwanted sources (for example, the Sun) and are transformed into Brightness Temperatures; finally, in the Level 1c the Brightness Temperatures are geolocated over the Earth in a discrete grid and several auxiliary parameters are computed and annotated in the L1c final product. The algorithms responsible for the Calibration (L1a), Image Reconstruction (L1b) and Geolocation (L1c) have been validated during the In-Orbit Commissioning Phase that took place in the first half of 2010. However, as the knowledge on the performance of MIRAS increases, it has become necessary to set in motion a review on the current algorithms. This paper focuses on the review of the Image Reconstruction algorithms being conducted by DEIMOS Engenharia and IRAP and it is divided in the following sections: in Section 1 the theory for the proposed alternatives with respect to the baseline algorithm is demonstrated, along with several examples to ilustrate them. All the results have been obtained using the baseline algorithm or the alternatives that have been implemented in the Level 1 Prototype Processor (L1PP); in Section 2 the impact on the Level 1 Operational Processor (L1OP) is assessed, using as reference the L1PP results; and finally, in Section 3 the main conclusions found throughout this paper are summarized."
1803298,14010,11104,Spatial-temporal analysis of field evapotranspiration based on complementary relationship model and IKONOS data,2013,"Mapping high spatial-temporal resolution evapotranspiration (ET) over large areas is important for water resources planning, precision irrigation and monitoring water use efficiency. However, both the traditional field measurement and aerodynamic estimation mainly focus on obtaining local ET. Remote sensing data often can be used to retrieve large area instantaneous ET at low spatial resolution over region or global scale. Therefore, using traditional measurements and high resolution image data to generate high spatial-temporal resolution ET is becoming an important research direction. In this paper, the complementary relationship model (CR) was employed together with meteorological data to estimate actual ET, and the results were validated by lysimeter observation. Furthermore, CR model was combined with high resolution image, IKONOS data, to estimate instantaneous field scale ET and they also were transferred into daily ET. The cumulative evapotranspiration (ET) of winter wheat during the reproductive phase from March to June of 2011 was 469.12 mm, essentially corresponding to the annual precipitation in the Beijing area. The most high accuracy of estimated ET by CR model is also on May(R 2 =0.863, RMSE=0.103 mm). The transferred daily ET by self-preservation of evaporative fraction(EF) method were consistent with lysimeter measurements for all four months(R 2 =0.937, RMSE=0.668 mm). It was proved in this study that CR model can be used to estimate precision field scale ET with meteorological data and high resolution remote sensing data together in a region with limited ground data availability."
752970,14010,11104,A novel method for building height estmation using TanDEM-X data,2014,"The main goal of the German TanDEM-X mission (TDM) is the provision of a global digital elevation model (DEM) at the unique spatial resolution of ~12m, which, compared to other freely available DEMs [e.g., STRM-DEM (90m), ASTER-GDEM (30m)], holds the potential to discriminate objects above the ground as, e.g., buildings. Accordingly, in this paper we present a novel unsupervised method for automatically estimating local height variations in built-up areas by means of the TanDEM-X DEM. In the first step, we identify points lying on the ground surface by means of a dedicated algorithm. In particular, the basic idea is that pixels associated with potential infrastructural elements can be identified and then excluded by analyzing the relative change in elevation with respect to their neighbors (indeed they locally exhibit greater height values with respect to ground pixels). Next, the remaining samples are used to generate a digital terrain model (DTM) of the investigated region by employing the Natural Neighbors (NN) interpolation algorithm. The local building height is finally estimated by subtracting the DTM from the original DEM. Preliminary experimental results obtained for the area of Dongying (China) which includes the Yellow River Delta (YRD) assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its potential to provide a reliable indication of the overall distribution of building height at large scale."
836711,14010,8441,Systematic surveillance for UAVs: A feedforward iterative learning control approach,2013,"UAVs (unmanned air vehicles) have contributed greatly to situational awareness through surveillance missions. However, complete autonomy of a UAV has yet to be realized due to the lack of reliable onboard sensing capabilities. Current research at the Air Force pairs UAVs with Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) to create a system that autonomously patrols, detects, and isolates intruders on a road network. During the patrol phase a UAV must visit each UGS, transitioning to the isolation phase if an intruder is detected. Optimizing the UAV flight plan during the patrol phase will lead to a faster response time and higher probability of capturing the intruder. The goal of this work is to investigate a learning-based approach that will enable more efficient and effective surveillance operations. In the proposed framework, techniques from adaptive feedforward iterative learning control and a region of attraction-based tracking approach have been used to optimize the UAV flight plan between surveillance flights. The proposed approach has resulted in the development of a novel learning control framework that leverages a region-based tracking requirement to minimize overall distance traveled, while guaranteeing convergence within the required tracking zone. Simulation results for a 1D example system demonstrate the validity of the control framework through an 8% reduction of overall distance traveled as compared to traditional surveillance strategies requiring tracking convergence to a single point. The proposed framework has the potential to significantly decrease the resources required for surveillance-based applications."
2167951,14010,9475,Partial state estimation for electricity grids,2013,"Power system operators rely critically on state estimation for verification, fault detection and localization, and re-dispatch under contingency operations. In current practice, power system data within a control area such as voltages, phases, real and reactive power flows and injections, are relayed to the operator using SCADA systems. State estimation is formulated as an over-determined weighted nonlinear least squares problem and the solver of choice is the Newton-Raphson method. Two critical issues are: (a) estimate quality, due to data latency or convergence to false local minima, and (b) computation time, due to the large number of state variables involved. In this paper, we explore techniques to accelerate state estimation by computing state estimates at a small subset of buses using limited measurements from the power subsystem of interest. These could be operator selected “important” buses which connect to “important” lines with significant real power transfer. Our techniques are inspired by uncertainty quantification methods. The influence of power flows from exogenous buses is treated as uncertainty which defines a feasible set of state variables consistent with available measurements. The state estimation problem can be cast as a non-convex optimization problem. We use a surrogate model relaxation and Shor's rank relaxation to obtain state estimates and associated error bounds at user-defined confidence levels."
838497,14010,9475,Developing proof carrying code to formally assure termination in fault tolerant distributed controls systems,2012,"We address the semantic gap between the model and the implementation of control algorithms for distributed systems in a formal fashion: we provide an interactive (partially automated) method by which to translate the global, model level theoretical properties, such as stability and convergence, into code level assertions and invariants which assure termination of the relevant implementations and validity of the result. We outline a simple flight control system example for altitude holding, and describe a fault-tolerant distributed agreement protocol among n processor nodes, in the presence of a varying network topology. We develop a Lyapunov-like function for the distributed algorithm, and attain a polynomial time theoretical bound on the convergence time T conv  ∝ n 3 . We then exploit the Lyapunov function and convergence proof, in order to derive requisite ANSI-C Specification Language (ACSL) annotations for the C code distributed implementation, in order to guarantee termination. The ACSL annotations can then be used to automatically generate formal proof obligations via the Frama-C tool. These proof obligations also encompass assertions relating to timing, memory allocation, type checking and processor specific issues. The proof obligations can then be automatically discharged using a theorem prover, and their success guarantees that the behavior of the corresponding distributed code will evince the global properties proven for the model. Thus, the verification process spans efforts from the high-level control theory to the low-level implementation as a C program."
1784320,14010,9475,Nonstationary analysis of cerebral hemodynamics using recursively estimated multiple-input nonlinear models,2011,"We present a computational scheme to obtain adaptive non-linear, multiple-input models of the Volterra-Wiener class, by utilizing Laguerre expansions of Volterra kernels in a recursive least-squares formulation. Function expansions have been proven successful in systems identification as they result in a significant reduction of the required free parameters, which is a major limiting factor particularly for nonlinear systems, whereby this number depends exponentially on the nonlinear system order. We apply this scheme in order to obtain adaptive estimates for a two-input model of cerebral hemodynamics, where the two inputs are arterial blood pressure (ABP) and end-tidal CO 2  (P ETCO2  ) variations and the output is cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) variations, by utilizing long-duration (40 min) experimental measurements of spontaneous variations of these signals in healthy humans. Maintenance of a relatively steady cerebral blood flow, despite changes in arterial pressure, is critical in order to meet the high metabolic demands of the brain. This is achieved by the synergistic action of various physiological factors, which may vary over different time-scales and also exhibit nonstationarities. We quantify these nonstationarities for the two main physiological determinants of cerebral blood flow variability (i.e., arterial pressure and arterial CO 2 ) by considering one- (ABP) and two-input (ABP and P ETCO2  ) models. The results illustrate the presence of nonstationarities which are frequency-dependent and also that incorporation of P ETCO2  as an additional input, results in estimates of dynamic pressure autoregulation that are more consistent with respect to time."
2333629,14010,9475,System identification of the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in gap junctional intracellular communications,2013,"Gap-Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (gap-FRAP) is a technique used to estimate functionality of intercellular connections in biology. Such a technique could potentially be involved in the diagnostic of normal/cancer cells. Discrimination of cell types may be performed directly, by comparing plots of fluorescence kinetics or indirectly by statistical testing applied to model parameters. This paper focuses on the latter model-based approach. Up to now, more than ninety percent of the models used to fit gap-FRAP responses have been derived from diffusion equations (partial differential equation). We propose to simplify the modeling procedure by using behavioral models derived from system identification techniques used in control engineering. To assess in practice the relevance of this concurrent method, two human head and neck carcinoma cell lines (KB and FaDu) were used. The former (KB) expresses connexin proteins (positive line) while the latter (FaDu) does not (negative line). Moreover, each cell line was tested on spheroid (3-D) and monolayer (2-D) slices and in vitro assays were repeated six times. System identification algorithms of the CONTSID Matlab toolbox were used to estimate the model parameters from the in vitro data sets. Results have particularly emphasized there is no need to use complex models to fit the observed gap-FRAP responses. We show that the static gain of the estimated transfer functions is able to discriminate cell types used in this study, which corroborates the relevance of system identification techniques for diagnostic applications based on gap-FRAP analysis."
1655993,14010,9475,On the identification of fast dynamics using slow rate camera measurements,2012,"This paper addresses the identification of the dynamics of a high bandwidth motion system using measurements from a slow rate integrative sensor. The motivation of this work is the need to characterize the dynamics of adaptive optics elements, such as deformable mirrors, using image array based sensors, such as CCD or CMOS wavefront sensors, which sample at a significantly lower rate than the actuator bandwidth. The integrative nature of the sensor produces a blurred image when the image moves much faster than the exposure period. The key concept of this paper is to extract system dynamics from the image blur. We consider the image blur as a nonlinear temporal-to-spatial transformation under a known input excitation, such as a sinusoid. The output signal parameters, such as amplitude and phase, characterize the frequency response of the system at the specific excitation frequency. This problem may be posed as a nonlinear minimization: finding output signal parameters to match the predicted spatial distribution with the measurement. However, the nonlinear mapping is not one-to-one, or, equivalently, the solution of the nonlinear minimization is non-unique. We propose two methods for avoiding this aliasing problem: by imposing a continuity constraint or by solving the minimization over two different exposure periods. The efficacy of the proposed identification approach for a single-input/single-output system is experimentally demonstrated by accurately obtaining the frequency response of a fast steering mirror up to 500Hz using a 30 Hz CCD camera."
847749,14010,9475,Voltage and reactive power control using approximate stochastic annealing,2013,"One of the objectives of smart grids is to optimize the performance of power devices to improve energy efficiency by utilizing additional data from smart meters. In particular, this is important for the transmission and distribution network, in which approximately 7% of the total energy generated is wasted. Efficient management of voltage profiles and reactive power in power distribution systems plays an important role towards this goal. In this paper, we consider voltage and reactive power control (VVC) problem with the objective to determine the proper settings of capacitor banks and transformer taps in power distribution systems to minimize daily energy losses. Voltage constraints and operation limits constraints on transformer load tap changers (LTCs) and shunt capacitors (SCs) are considered in our model. We propose a stochastic search algorithm called Approximate Stochastic Annealing (ASA) for solving this VVC problem. The algorithm searches the optimal control schedule by randomly sampling from a sequence of probability distributions over the space of all possible settings of LTCs and SCs. A Lagrangian RelaxationDynamic Programming (LR-DP) algorithm is also proposed to obtain upper and lower bounds on the performance of the optimal solution. Our testing results on the well-known PG&E 69-bus distribution network indicate that the ASA algorithm may yield solutions very close to optimum within a modest amount of computational time."
1530554,14010,9475,Recursive estimation of common partially observed disturbances in MFG systems with application to large scale power markets,2013,"Power markets are modelled as dynamic large population games where suppliers and consumers submit their bids in real-time. The agents are coupled in their dynamics and cost functions through the price process. Here, a common unpredictable partially observed major agent is added to the system which represents common unpredictable disturbance factors (e.g. wind) and exogenous market factors (e.g. competing energy resource prices), etc. In previous work, the Mean Field Game (MFG) methodology was used to study the limit (Le., infinite population) behaviour of large population market systems without a major agent; this results in a decentralized algorithm where agents submit their bids solely using statistical information on the dynamics of the entire population. When a major agent is absent, the system exhibits the standard counter intuitive property of MFG solutions that agents need not observe the behaviour (i.e., inputs and state trajectories, market price evolution, etc.) of any other agent (individually or collectively) in order that simple decentralized control actions achieve a mass ϵ-Nash equilibrium (with ϵ vanishing as the population goes to infinity) and individual L 2  stability. The contribution of this paper is the extension of the MFG theory to cover the addition of a major agent to the power market problem. In general, the addition of a major agent in the MFG framework makes the mean field stochastic in contrast to the situation with purely minor agents where the mean field is deterministic. In the general situation of sporadic noisy observations of the mean field and the state of the major agent, the extended MFG theory (with estimation of the mean field and the major agent state) yields simple decentralized control laws which achieve a mass ϵ-Nash equilibrium (with ϵ vanishing as the population goes to infinity) and individual L 2  stability. In this paper, this is carried out for the MFG formulation of the power market problem in order to fit the situation where sporadic noisy observations of the state of the major agent and of the market price are available for recursive mean field state estimation."
1702613,14010,11104,Geo-location correction of CBERS 2B imagery using fast template matching on a GPU,2012,"CBERS 2B satellite imagery was acquired in the period 2007–2010, at 2.5 m (panchromatic) and 20 m (multi-spectral) spatial resolution, respectively. Much of the archived data is available, free of charge, via the Brazilian space organization INPE. However, to be suitable for wide area mapping at scales 1:50,000 to 1:100,000 scales (or better), errors in geo-location, which range from several 100s of meters to several kilometers, must be corrected for each individual image frame. We demonstrate a novel method which deploys very fast template matching using GPU accelerated convolution. The method can be used with template samples from a globally consistent reference set. We demonstrate this with the use of the Terracolor LANDSAT product over Brazil and with Bing maps extracts for some urban areas in panchromatic scenes. The main advantage of the method is the possibility to use a large number of templates of a significant size (256 by 256, or 512 by 512 pixels). Processing time remains below 1 minutes per frame, which includes template selection via a WMS service. The result of the match is supplied as a list of ground control points, which we store in the VRT format, allowing the use of GDAL for transformation. We discuss implementation details and show how we can apply the method to other sensor combinations as well."
2042416,14010,11104,Anisotropy in ocean scattering of bistatic radar using signals of opportunity,2011,"This paper present experimental results demonstrating the use of “signals of opportunity” from digital communications satellites (XM radio) as bistatic radar for ocean remote sensing. This builds upon the previous work which demonstrated that the shape of the cross-correlation “waveform” of reflected XM radio signals is sensitive to the roughness of the ocean surface. In these new results, we compare this sensitivity between the waveforms produced from the two XM radio satellites, viewed simultaneously at different azimuths, and show that a small discrepancy exists in the mean square slope (MSS) retrievals obtained from each of them. We then investigate the hypothesis that this discrepancy is the result of neglecting anisotropy in the model for the probability density function (PDF) of surface slopes and that this discrepancy might be useful for sensing the wind direction. In order to do so, a two-stage estimation process was applied to data collected on an airborne experiment that recorded the direct line of sight and reflected XM radio signals. In the first step, an isotropic normal distribution was assumed for the PDF and the mean square slope (MSS) was fit to the measured waveform data from each satellite independently. Since the two satellites are located at different azimuths, a difference between the two MSS estimates were observed. The second step involved using a bidirectional normal PDF with MSS constrained to that obtained from the first step, and a value was assumed for the ratio of upwind and crosswind slopes. The direction of the principal axes was varied to minimize the total residuals for both satellites. The results were compared with Chesapeake Lighthouse recordings of the local wind direction."
718917,14010,11104,"Efficiency of multi-frequency, multi-polarized SAR data to monitor growth stages of oilpalm plants in Sarawak, Malaysia",2013,"Carbon rich tropical forests of Southeast Asia have increasingly become a target for the conversion to plantation area. Plantations are economically important for the local society because they provide incentives in a short period of time. Southeast Asia has a high rate of conversion of tropical forests to various types of plantation species such as oilpalm, rubber, acacia, cashew, teak, eucalyptus etc. Therefore, monitoring of carbon loss due to the conversion of forests to various plantation species has become crucial in the global carbon cycle. Information about the age or growth stages (juvenile, young, mature and old) of plantation species is a useful parameter to calculate carbon sequestration as well as for predicting yield and a range of management practices such as determining location for thinning, harvesting and replantation. This study focuses on the comparison and efficiency of multi-frequency, multi-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to monitor various growth stages of oilpalm plants in Sarawak, Malaysia based on backscattering and polarimetric decomposition techniques. Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data with dual and quad polarization, Radarsat-2 data with quad polarization and TerraSAR-X (TSX) data with HH polarization have been used in this investigation. Results show that, PALSAR data with HV polarization shows highest sensitivity with the oilpalm plant's age as compared to other SAR data. TSX based texture information will also be utilized to find the important texture parameters to identify various growth stages of oilpalm plants."
1215074,14010,11104,Development of a novel algorithm to calculate the optic properties of temporal aerosols through Remote Sensing data measurements: Prospective study,2012,"Satellite' sensors as well as ground-based sun photometers instruments surface are utilized gather data about the quantitative composition of components in the Earth's atmosphere. The relationships among these components produce effects in different phenomena, like regional climate change. Aerosols, consisting of particles from 0.01 to 10 µm, are atmosphere components, whose effects are still poorly understood. Through Remote Sensing, it is possible to classify them and gain information about their role in different atmospheric processes: low visibility, solar energy balance, cloud formation and increases or decreases of the quantity of precipitation. This paper describes how the study and analysis of satellite-based and ground-based measurements can be used to develop and validate a novel procedure to calculate the optical properties of temporal aerosols found in and around Guadalajara, based on previous algorithms:, to determine the aerosol size distribution function, scattering phase function, single scattering albedo, complex refractive index and asymmetry parameter. The quantifiable knowledge about the temporal and regional aerosols' optical properties will contribute to future investigations related to their quantitative effects on atmospheric processes in this region. These effects include: alteration of weather and climate, change of the tropospheric temperature, contribution to environmental ills, the formation and properties of the clouds, effects on the ecosystems, local solar energy balance, and the impacts on human health."
1108675,14010,11104,Estimation of significant wave height using reflected digital communication signals,2013,"This paper presents a semi-empirical relationship between the coherence time of ocean-reflected digital satellite radio signals and significant wave height (SWH). An experiment was conducted on Platform Harvest, a petrochemical exploration platform located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California. Raw data were recorded from both directly-received and ocean-reflected signals from the XMradio (S-bandwith center frequency 2.342 GHz), and DirecTV (Ku-Band with center frequency 12.239 GHz) from antennas located at an approximate altitude of 27 meters above the ocean surface. Using a technique first developed for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, the coherence time of the Interferometric Complex Field (ICF) is computed by cross-correlating the direct and reflected signals. A relationship is developed between the ICF and SWH. This is done by first developing a model showing a relationship between ICF, correlation time of the sea surface and SWH. A Monte Carlo simulation of the ocean surface is used to show that empirical relationship between correlation time of the sea surface and SWH takes a quadratic form. The coefficients of this empirical model are finally determined from fitting experimental data of S-band signals and a limited amount of Ku-band signals, from the XM radio and DirecTV transmission, respectively. The retrievals of SWH from experimental data through inverting this relationship are then compared to the in-situ recordings from the nearest buoy (8 km away). S-band measurements are found to have a standard deviation of 0.51 meters over a range of SWH from 1 to 5.6 meters."
1694547,14010,11104,OMPS early orbit dark and bias evaluation and calibration,2012,"The dark signal on an Ozone Mapper Profiler Suite (OMPS) charge-coupled device (CCD) results when electrons are thermally emitted into the conduction band of pixels in the active and storage regions. It effectively adds offsets to the photon-generated pixel counts and therefore impacts the Sensor Data Record (SDR) performance. This paper presents OMPS on-orbit results from dark current and electrical bias characterization and calibration on the system level. In particular, data from nominal and diagnostic activities has been collected and analyzed to extract general trends and features about the in-flight detector behaviors. The in-flight dark and bias signals are then compared with the prelaunch on-ground performance for each channel. The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) impact and temperature dependency are also addressed. The analysis results have demonstrated that the OMPS CCD performance successfully transferred from ground to orbit; the in-flight timing pattern of the nominal dark measurements are well suited to determine general dark currents of the individual pixels, and data collected during the early orbit calibration are sufficient to perform internal consistency checks of sensor dark and bias parameters and instrument behavior. Results also suggest that to minimize the influence of hot pixels and other effects of CCD lattice damage due to energetic particle hits, the dark current shall be updated on a daily basis rather than the weekly basis as planned."
1991783,14010,11104,Mapping natura 2000 heathland in Belgium - an evaluation of ensemble classifiers for spaceborne angular CHRIS/Proba imagery,2011,"Natura 2000 is an ecological network of protected areas in the territory of the European Union (EU). With the introduction of the Habitats Directive in 1992, EU member states are obligated to report every six years the status of the Natura 2000 habitats so that better conservation policy can be formulated. This paper examines the use of angular hyperspectral CHRIS/Proba image for the mapping of heathland at a Belgian Natura 2000 site. We find that the use of angular images increases the overall classification rate as compared to using only the nadir image; with the incorporation of angular images the final mapping is also more homogenous with less salt and pepper effect. While the class accuracy of Calluna- and Erica-dominated heathlands are still low, class accuracy of Molinia-dominated heathland is generally more encouraging. Two tree-based ensemble classifiers, Random Forest (RF) and Adaboost, were compared with Support Vector Machines (SVM). When only the nadir image was used, SVM attained the highest accuracy. When angular images were included, all three classifiers obtained comparable accuracies though in general RF and Adaboost had faster training time. We also adopted an assessment approach which repeats the accuracy assessment in ten independent trials, instead of the common practice of having only one trial. Our results show that accuracy attainment can vary significantly among different trials and hence it is recommendable to have more than one trial in order that a more objective characterization of the classifiers is obtained.  1"
1781813,14010,20896,Efficient Sensing Matters a Lot for Large-Scale Batteries,2011,"A large-scale battery pack that consists of hundreds or thousands of battery cells must be carefully monitored. Due to the divergence of cell characteristics, every cell should be monitored periodically and accurately. There are two important issues in monitoring large-scale packs. First, sensing the health condition of battery cells must be timely to capture the turning point at which the battery condition abruptly changes. Failure to capture such an important event can cause irreversible damage to the battery, especially when its State-of-Charge (SoC) is very low. Second, the more the hardware components are used, the higher the failure rate the system will suffer. The frequency of monitoring battery cells, thus, should be adjustable to the underlying load demand, considering the fact that a low load demand has a minute impact on the battery condition. We propose to address these issues via an adaptive monitoring architecture, called AdMon. AdMon lowers the sensing latency effectively, making it effective to enhance the tolerance of physical cell failures. AdMon consists of sensing, path-switching, and computing systems. The sensing system collects data from a battery-cell array. The path-switching system effectively connects a specific sensor and a micro-controller that is part of the computing system. The path-switching system is characterized by three exclusive types of topology: n-tree-based, cascaded, and parallel. The computing system is synergistically combined with the other two systems while three policies specified in the computing system are applied. The AdMon architecture is shown to outperform a non-adaptive monitoring system with respect to the battery life by 67%."
2093407,14010,11104,Robust recovery of synthetic aperture radar data from uniformly under-sampled measurements,2011,"In this paper, we propose a novel robust sparse-recovery technique that allows sub-Nyquist uniform under-sampling of wide-bandwidth radar data in real time (single observation). Although much of the information is lost in the received signal due to the low sampling rate, we hypothesize that each wide-bandwidth radar data record can be modeled as a superposition of many backscattered signals from reflective point targets in the scene. In other words, our proposed technique is based on direct sparse recovery via orthogonal matching pursuit using a special dictionary containing many time-delayed versions of the transmitted probing signal. Using data from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Ultra-Wideband (UWB) synthetic aperture radar (SAR), we show that the proposed sparse-recovery model-based (SMB) technique successfully models and synthesizes the returned radar data from real-world scenes using only an analytical waveform that models the transmitted signal and a handful of reflectivity coefficients. More importantly, the reconstructed SAR imagery using the SBM technique with data sampled at only 20% of the original sampling rate has a comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the original SAR imagery. For comparison purpose, the paper also presents SAR images recovered from conventional interpolation techniques and the standard random projection based compressed sensing technique, both of which resulted in very poor SAR image quality at the same sub-Nyquist sampling rate (20%)."
1003435,14010,9475,Control and verification of high-dimensional systems with DSOS and SDSOS programming,2014,"In this paper, we consider linear programming (LP) and second order cone programming (SOCP) based alternatives to sum of squares (SOS) programming and apply this framework to high-dimensional problems arising in control applications. Despite the wide acceptance of SOS programming in the control and optimization communities, scalability has been a key challenge due to its reliance on semidefinite programming (SDP) as its main computational engine. While SDPs have many appealing features, current SDP solvers do not approach the scalability or numerical maturity of LP and SOCP solvers. Our approach is based on the recent work of Ahmadi and Majumdar [1], which replaces the positive semidefiniteness constraint inherent in the SOS approach with stronger conditions based on diagonal dominance and scaled diagonal dominance. This leads to the DSOS and SDSOS cones of polynomials, which can be optimized over using LP and SOCP respectively. We demonstrate this approach on four high dimensional control problems that are currently well beyond the reach of SOS programming: computing a region of attraction for a 22 dimensional system, analysis of a 50 node network of oscillators, searching for degree 3 controllers and degree 8 Lyapunov functions for an Acrobot system (with the resulting controller validated on a hardware platform), and a balancing controller for a 30 state and 14 control input model of the ATLAS humanoid robot. While there is additional conservatism introduced by our approach, extensive numerical experiments on smaller instances of our problems demonstrate that this conservatism can be small compared to SOS programming."

Egypt that is mainly covered by dry sand is still not well understood, and its groundwater potential remains largely unknown. The ALOS/PALSAR L-band sensor has been used to detect and delineate the subsurface structures along the study area. The circular polarization transformation has been applied on the ALOS/PALSAR full polanmetric data by changing the orientation angle (ψ=0°) and elliptical angle (χ = 45°) and revealed many buried faults in various strike directions, which were not reported on the last version of the official geologic map. Such derived circular polarization images were further enhanced by applying the Optimal Polarization Contrast Enhancement (O.P.C.E) method. Thus the proper stocks vectors of the transmitter and receiver have been calculated from the PALSAR full polanmetric data and plotted on the Poincare sphere to determine the best polarization states for imaging these buried faults. The moisture content of the study sites was generally low, with an average of roughly 0.3% during the field campaign. Therefore, the average Root Mean Square Height (h RMs ) of the surface roughness was 0.01 cm across all sites. On the other hand, 21 conventional 2D-GPR profiles have been acquired using 270 MHz antenna to validate the radar remote sensing results. These GPR profiles reveal obvious offset in the subsurface stratigraphy."
848646,14010,9475,Tracking of the UAV trajectory on the basis of bearing-only observations,2014,"This work considers the tracking of the UAV (unmanned aviation vehicle) path on the basis of bearingonly observations including azimuth and elevation angles. The significance of this research becomes clear in the case when GPS either does not work at all or produce the high level of the measurement errors. It is assumed that either UAV's opto-electronic cameras or radar systems are able to capture the angular position of objects with known coordinates and to measure the azimuth and elevation angles of the sight line. Such measurements involve the real position of UAV in implicit form, and therefore some of nonlinear filters such as Extended Kalman filter (EKF) or others may be used in order to implement these measurements for UAV control. However, all such approximate nonlinear filters produce the estimations with unknown bias and quadratic errors. This peculiarity prevents the data fusion in more or less regular way. Meanwhile, there is well-known method of pseudomeasurements which reduces the estimation problem to the linear settings. In this article we develop the modified pseudomeasurement method without bias and with the possibility to evaluate the second moments of the UAV position errors which helps to realize the data fusion. On the basis of this filtering algorithm we develop the control algorithm for tracking of given reference path under external perturbation and noised angular measurements. Modelling examples show the nice performance of the control algorithm."
680188,14010,9475,A packetized direct load control mechanism for demand side management,2012,"Electricity peaks can be harmful to grid stability and result in additional generation costs to balance supply with demand. By developing a network of smart appliances together with a quasi-decentralized control protocol, direct load control (DLC) provides an opportunity to reduce peak consumption by directly controlling the on/off switch of the networked appliances. This paper proposes a packetized DLC (PDLC) solution that is illustrated by an application to air conditioning temperature control. Here the term packetized refers to a fixed time energy usage authorization. The consumers in each room choose their preferred set point, and then an operator of the local appliance pool will determine the comfort band around the set point. We use a thermal dynamic model to investigate the duty cycle of thermostatic appliances. Three theorems are proposed in this paper. The first two theorems evaluate the performance of the PDLC in both transient and steady state operation. The first theorem proves that the average room temperature would converge to the average room set point with fixed number of packets applied in each discrete interval. The second theorem proves that the PDLC solution guarantees to control the temperature of all the rooms within their individual comfort bands. The third theorem proposes an allocation method to link the results in theorem 1 and assumptions in theorem 2 such that the overall PDLC solution works. The direct result of the theorems is that we can reduce the consumption oscillation that occurs when no control is applied. Simulation is provided to verify theoretical results."
2389371,14010,20896,Multicast authentication in the smart grid with one-time signatures from sigma-protocols,2013,"Security for multicast communication by mutual (sender and receiver) authentication is a challenging problem in the smart grid given the unique constraints in communication bandwidth, computation time, and computational resources of field devices. Traditional public-key infrastructure based digital signature schemes (such as RSA) cannot be naively adapted for secure communication in the smart-grid because of: (i) increased communication burden (large key sizes which increase communication bandwidth), (ii) increased time for decryption/verification (which increase latency) and (iii) the limited computational capabilities of smart-meters and other field devices. These unique constraints limit the direct application of generic solutions with one-time signature schemes, (OTS), or the Bins and Balls (BiBa) scheme for broadcast authentication, or improvements via HORS (Hash to Obtain Random Subset). While the signature size and verification time are small, the public-key size is large with moderate overhead for signature generation with BiBa. A significant reduction in signing overhead is achieved with HORS which makes it useful for several multicast authentication applications. However, even HORS is not well suited for smart grid applications mainly because it requires large public key sizes. For power-grid communications, the most recent multicast authentication protocol called Tunable Signing and Verification (TSV) [1] reduces the signature size (over HORS) at the expense of increased computations at sender or receiver. Hence the need for better one-time signature schemes that will require fewer resources at the receiver, with modest signature sizes and low sender computations is both urgent and important in the smart-grid environment."
863084,14010,11104,ESA lidar space missions and supporting activities,2013,"The European Space Agency's (ESA's) Living Planet Programme includes two types of complementary user driven missions: the research oriented Earth Explorer missions and the operational service oriented Earth Watch missions. Earth Explorer missions are also divided into the Core missions being larger missions demonstrating the capabilities of new technologies addressing issues of wide scientific interest, and the Opportunity missions with a similar scope but being smaller in terms of cost. Within ESA's Living Planet Program, four lidar missions have been candidates, whereof two are selected and are being implemented. ESA's first lidar mission, the Atmospheric Dynamics Mission (ADM-Aeolus), was chosen as the second Earth Explorer Core mission in 1999. It shall demonstrate the potential of high spectral resolution Doppler Wind Lidars for operational measurements of wind profiles and their use in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). Additional Spin-off products are profiles of cloud and aerosol optical properties. The second mission hosting a Lidar, EarthCARE, was selected as the third Earth Explorer Core mission in 2004. It is a joint European and Japanese effort and targets radiation/cloud/aerosol interactions and processes. The EarthCARE high-spectral resolution lidar, ATLID, shall measure cloud and aerosol optical properties. Global measurements of these parameters are also of great importance to NWP and climate modeling. Furthermore DIAL concepts for CH 4 , H 2 O and CO 2  monitoring were candidates for ESA's 5th and 7th Earth Explorers. The missions were not selected, but initiated technology activities to raise the related technology levels [1,2]."
1008956,14010,11104,Satellite-based glacier monitoring in the ESA project Glaciers_cci,2012,"Glaciers and their changes have been in the focus of the public and the media over the past decade, as they reflect impacts of climate change in an extraordinarily clear and understandable way. They are thus considered as key indicators of climate change and play a most important role in globally coordinated climate-related monitoring programs like the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Glacier changes are widely reported with related adverse impacts when errors occur [4]. In consequence, all measurements must be performed with great care and should have been quality checked. Complementary to the field-based observations of changes in glacier length and mass on selected glaciers world-wide [12], satellite data offer the unique possibility to cover entire mountain ranges with a consistent method and thus help creating a more complete and representative picture of ongoing changes. From the large number of possible glacier observations that can be made with (repeat) satellite data, the Glaciers_cci project is focusing on three of them: Glacier area, elevation changes and velocity fields. The characteristics of the satellite sensors used to derive these three products are rather complimentary in regard to spectral properties (optical, microwave, LIDAR), spatial resolution, temporal coverage, repeat interval, etc. Glaciological studies greatly benefit from this wealth of data types and can utilize the different possibilities to derive specific properties of glaciers."
842280,14010,11104,Classwise hyperspectral image classification with PerTurbo method,2012,"A new classification technique, PerTurbo, has been investigated in the context on hyperspectral remote sensing images context. In this framework, each class is characterised by its Laplace-Beltrami operator, then approximated by the spectrum of K(S), whose terms are derived from the Gaussian kernel. The method is very simple, easy to implement and involves few parameters to tune. It also allows the definition of a simple multi-class strategy, and, as a class-wise classification method, the addition of a new class does not requires the re-training of the pre-existing class models. We conducted experiments on two datasets: results for Pavia Centre dataset are encouraging, while results obtained on Pavia University show that SVM clearly outperforms PerTurbo. Nevertheless, we believe that this difference comes from a bad parametrization of the algorithm (for which we used a rule of thumb, contrarily to the SVM procedure which was fully optimized). Hence, a systematic search for the optimal value of the parameter would improve the results. Moreover, there are several other possible improvements coming from the fields of regularization methods of dimensionality reduction techniques which let us think that this first experiment is promising. In the near future, we also plan to investigate rules leading to a better choice of s. We are also interested in studying the behavior of PerTurbo when the classes are heterogeneous with only few training samples available, or when the classes in the training set are highly unbalanced."
1118989,14010,11104,The spectral reflectance of ship wakes between 400 and 900 nanometers,2012,"This technical note describes the use of an airborne hyperspectral imaging sensor (HICO - Hyperspectral Imager of the Coastal Ocean) to record the spectral reflectance characteristics of centerline ship wakes in the 400 to 900 nm wavelength region. Data were collected for a target of known provenance (the United States Coast Guard Cutter Kittiwake) off the Wai'anae coast of O'ahu, Hawai'i, on 8 April 2010. HICO acquired data in 60 spectral bands by flying along the long axis of the wake while the vessel travelled at three speeds (∼3.6 m s −1  or 7 knots; ∼7.2 m s −1  or 14 knots; and ∼11.2 m s −1  or 21 knots). A flying altitude of ∼1500 m yielded a spatial resolution of ∼1.5 m. Spectral profiles along and across the wake axes are presented which show how the spectral reflectance of the centerline wake varies spatially and temporally as a function of vessel speed. Length (and to a lesser extent, width) vary in proportion to speed. In common with previous studies and model predictions, the wakes show a pronounced greening of the wake (i.e. enhanced reflectance at ∼550 nm), with evidence for elevated reflectance at 750–800 nm. Resampling the data from its raw 1.5 m spatial resolution yields insights into how the turbulent wake becomes spectrally inseparable from the background water as spatial resolution decreases (i.e. becomes increasingly coarse). Using a simple statistical test, the wake becomes spectrally similar to the background ocean as the resolution approaches 60 m."
1994719,14010,20896,An Ultra Low Power Granular Decision Making Using Cross Correlation: Minimizing Signal Segments for Template Matching,2011,"Wearable sensor platforms have proved effective in a large variety of new application domains including wellness and healthcare, and are perfect examples of cyber physical systems. A major obstacle in realization of these systems is the amount of energy required for sensing, processing and communication, which can jeopardize small battery size and wear ability of the entire system. In this paper, we propose an ultra low power granular decision making architecture, also called screening classifier, that can be viewed as a tiered wake up circuitry. This processing model operates based on simple template matching. Ideally, the template matching is performed with low sensitivity but at very low power. Initial template matching removes signals that are obviously not of interest from the signal processing chain keeping the rest of processing modules inactive. If the signal is likely to be of interest, the sensitivity and the power of the template matching blocks are gradually increased and eventually the microcontroller is activated. We pose and solve an optimization problem to realize our screening classifier and improve the accuracy of classification by dividing a full template into smaller bins, called mini-templates, and activating optimal number of bins during each classification decision. Our experimental results on real data show that the power consumption of the system can be reduced by more than 70% using this intelligent processing architecture. The power consumption of the proposed granular decision making module is six orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art low power microcontrollers."
1642619,14010,9475,A risk-constrained multi-stage decision making approach to the architectural analysis of planetary missions,2012,"This paper presents a novel risk-constrained multi-stage decision making approach to the architectural analysis of planetary rover missions. In particular, focusing on a 2018 Mars rover concept, which was considered as part of a potential Mars Sample Return campaign, we model the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) phase and the rover traverse phase as four sequential decision-making stages. The problem is to find a sequence of divert and driving maneuvers so that the rover drive is minimized and the probability of a mission failure (e.g., due to a failed landing) is below a user-specified bound. By solving this problem for several different values of the model parameters (e.g., divert authority), this approach enables rigorous, accurate and systematic trade-offs for the EDL system vs. the mobility system, and, more in general, cross-domain trade-offs for the different phases of a space mission. The overall optimization problem can be seen as a chance-constrained dynamic programming problem, with the additional complexity that 1) in some stages the disturbances do not have any probabilistic characterization, and 2) the state space is extremely large (i.e, hundreds of millions of states for trade-offs with high-resolution Martian maps). To this purpose, we solve the problem by performing an unconventional combination of average and minimax cost analysis and by leveraging high efficient computation tools from the image processing community. Preliminary trade-off results are presented."
311561,14010,9475,Designing games for distributed optimization,2011,"The central goal in multiagent systems is to design local control laws for the individual agents to ensure that the emergent global behavior is desirable with respect to a given system level objective. Ideally, a system designer seeks to satisfy this goal while conditioning each agent's control law on the least amount of information possible. Unfortunately, there are no existing methodologies for addressing this design challenge. The goal of this paper is to address this challenge using the field of game theory. Utilizing game theory for the design and control of multiagent systems requires two steps: (i) defining a local objective function for each decision maker and (ii) specifying a distributed learning algorithm to reach a desirable operating point. One of the core advantages of this game theoretic approach is that this two step process can be decoupled by utilizing specific classes of games. For example, if the designed objective functions result in a potential game then the system designer can utilize distributed learning algorithms for potential games to complete step (ii) of the design process. Unfortunately, designing agent objective functions to meet objectives such as locality of information and efficiency of resulting equilibria within the framework of potential games is fundamentally challenging and in many case impossible. In this paper we develop a systematic methodology for meeting these objectives using a broader framework of games termed state based potential games. State based potential games is an extension of potential games where an additional state variable is introduced into the game environment hence permitting more flexibility in our design space. Furthermore, state based potential games possess an underlying structure that can be exploited by distributed learning algorithms in a similar fashion to potential games hence providing a new baseline for our decomposition."
793012,14010,9475,Robust fault detection and reconfiguration in sampled-data uncertain distributed processes,2011,"This paper focuses on robust model-based fault detection and fault-tolerant control of spatially distributed processes described by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) subject to time-varying external disturbances, control actuator faults and measurement sampling rate constraints. Using an approximate finite-dimensional system that captures the dominant dynamics of the PDE, an observer-based output feedback controller is initially designed to enforce robust stability with an arbitrarily small ultimate bound on the closed-loop state in the absence of faults. A finite-dimensional inter-sample model predictor is then embedded within the controller to provide the observer with estimates of the measured output between the sampling times, and the state of the model is updated using the measured output at each sampling time. By formulating the sampled-data finite-dimensional closed-loop system as a combined discrete-continuous system, a necessary and sufficient condition for robust closed-loop stability is obtained and used to explicitly characterize the tradeoffs between the sampling rate, the degree of model uncertainty, the disturbance size, the size of the achievable ultimate bound on the closed-loop state, and the choice of actuator/sensor locations. Based on this analysis, a time-varying alarm threshold on the fault detection residual is obtained, together with an actuator reconfiguration law that determines the set of feasible fall-back actuators that preserve robust closed-loop stability. Finally, the result is illustrated through an application to a representative diffusion-reaction process."
702400,14010,9475,An improved Predictive Optimal Controller with elastic search space for steam temperature control of large-scale supercritical power unit,2012,"Predictive optimal control (POC) combined with artificial neural networks (ANNs) modeling and advanced heuristic optimization is a powerful technique for intelligent control. But actual implementation of the POC in complex industrial processes is limited by its known drawbacks, including the oscillation resulting from random search direction, difficulty in meeting the real-time requirement, and unresolved adaptability and generalization ability of the ANN predictive model. In resolving these problems, an improved Intelligent Predictive Optimal Controller (IPOC) with elastic search space is proposed in this paper. A new simpler and high-efficiency Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted to find the optimal solution in fewer epochs to meet the real-time control requirements. The system output error in each control step is fed back to adjust the search space dynamically to prevent control oscillation and also make it easier to find the optimal solution. An improved recurrent neural network with external delayed inputs and outputs is constructed to model the dynamic response of the highly nonlinear system. The proposed IPOC is used to superheater steam temperature control of a 600MW supercritical power unit. Extensive control simulation tests are made to verify the validity of the new control scheme in a full-scope simulator."
2509461,14010,11104,Scaling analysis of heterogneity in support of soil moisture retrieval at landscape level for low-frequency radars,2013,"Most traditional radar retrieval techniques utilize radar forward models that assume or require homogeneous scenes. NASA's upcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission launching in October 2014 will carry an L-band radar delivering a pixel size of 3 km × 3 km. Even though this resolution is finer than the SMAP 36 km radiometer pixels, it is still coarse enough that modeling such pixels assuming homogeneous scenes is not realistic. This highlights the need to develop spatial aggregation and disaggregation techniques using radar forward scattering models that assume homogeneity over fine-scale sub-pixels and derive tailor-made models for their contribution to the coarse-scale satellite pixel for successful soil moisture retrieval. For radar based soil moisture retrieval to be a strong candidate for future products, this uncertainty has to be successfully mitigated. To study the heterogeneity at landscape level, high-resolution P-band data from the Earth Venture 1 (EV-1) Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) mission is used as its pixel resolution is fine enough to assume homogeneity over a pixel. In this work, a sampling area over a well-known AirMOSS study site is chosen, an aggregation study based on landcover type is carried out and a coarse resolution radar backscatter function over the sampling area is found to be a weighted linear average of the contributions of the fine-scale pixels."
881075,14010,11104,Airborne wind retrieval using GPS delay-Doppler maps,2012,"Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has emerged recently as a promising remote sensing tool to retrieve various geophysical parameters of Earth's surface. GNSS-reflected signals, after being received and processed by the airborne or space-borne receiver, are available as delay correlation waveforms or as delay-Doppler maps. In the case of a rough ocean surface, those characteristics can be related to the RMS of L-band limited slopes of the surface waves, and from there to the surface wind speed. The raw GNSS-reflected signal can be processed either in real time by the receiver, or can be recorded and stored onboard and post-processed in a laboratory. The latter approach leveraging a software receiver allows more flexibility while processing the raw data. This work analyzes Delay Doppler Maps (DDM) obtained as a result of processing of the data collected by the GPS data logger/software receiver onboard the NOAA Gulfstream-IV jet aircraft. Thereafter, the DDMs were used to retrieve surface wind speed employing several different metrics that characterize the DDM extent in the Doppler frequency-delay domain. In contrast to previous works in which winds have been retrieved by fitting the theoretically modeled curves into measured correlation waveforms, here we do not rely on any model for the determination. Instead, the approach is based on a linear regression between DDMs observables and the wind speeds obtained in simultaneous GPS dropsonde measurements."
1800684,14010,11104,A land cover map of Africa at 100 meters resolution using a mosaic of alos PALSAR dual-polarization data: Preliminary developments,2011,"In this paper, we investigate the potential of large-scale mosaics of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for land cover mapping. The study is based on a wall-to-wall mosaic of double-polarization data (HH and HV) from the L-band sensor PALSAR, covering the whole African continent at a spatial resolution of about 100m. The GlobCover 2009 global land cover map is taken as a reference for the training of the classification algorithm. The joint use of the PALSAR mosaic, the GlobCover 2009 map and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) allows retrieving backscatter signatures that take into account local topography (slope angle and slope orientation) for each of the 22 GlobCover classes. These signatures are then used to assign each pixel of the mosaic to one class. The 22 classes are finally combined to coarser classes: tree cover, shrub cover, herbaceous cover/bare soil, and water. Because of ecological and phenological variations over the continent, this land cover mapping scheme is actually applied to 5° by 5° tiles. The methodology has been developed so far on two tiles which illustrate different ecoregions. A visual assessment indicates that the classified maps are very satisfying, at least for the tree cover class, with a significantly improved spatial resolution compared to existing large-scale land cover products. Validation is ongoing before applying the method to the whole Africa in the future."
1342625,14010,11104,Global water cycle and climate change signals observed by satellite gravimetry,2012,"Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is an important parameter in water resource manages and research of land-surface processes and hydrological cycle. However, the traditional instruments are very difficult to monitor global high temporal-spatial terrestrial water storage and its variability without a comprehensive global monitoring network of hydrological parameters due to high cost and high labor intensity. The recent Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provides a unique opportunity to directly measure the global TWS and its change at multi-scales from August 2002 to February 2011. In this paper, the global terrestrial water storages with monthly resolution are derived from approximate 10 years of monthly GRACE measurements (2002 August-2011 February), and their changes at seasonal and long-term scales are investigated and compared with GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) model. Results show that significant annual variations of TWS are found at the globe, agreeing well with GLDAS model estimates. The secular trends are also observed at specific areas, reflecting extreme climate events, e.g., ice melting in Antarctica, Greenland, Canadian Islands, Alaska, Himalayan and Patagonia glaciers, La Plata drought in South American as well as floods in North Amazon, while the GLDAS model cannot capture these signals well."
1112774,14010,9475,How can macroscopic models reveal self-organization in traffic flow?,2012,"In this paper we propose a new modeling technique for vehicular traffic flow, designed for capturing at a macroscopic level some effects, due to the microscopic granularity of the flow of cars, which would be lost with a purely continuous approach. The starting point is a multiscale method for pedestrian modeling, recently introduced in [1], in which measure-theoretic tools are used to manage the microscopic and the macroscopic scales under a unique framework. In the resulting coupled model the two scales coexist and share information, in the sense that the same system is simultaneously described from both a discrete (microscopic) and a continuous (macroscopic) perspective. This way it is possible to perform numerical simulations in which the single trajectories and the average density of the moving agents affect each other. Such a method is here revisited in order to deal with multi-population traffic flow on networks. For illustrative purposes, we focus on the simple case of the intersection of two roads. By exploiting one of the main features of the multiscale method, namely its dimension-independence, we treat one-dimensional roads and two-dimensional junctions in a natural way, without referring to classical network theory. Furthermore, thanks to the coupling between the microscopic and the macroscopic scales, we model the continuous flow of cars without losing the right amount of granularity, which characterizes the real physical system and triggers self-organization effects, such as, for example, the oscillatory patterns visible at jammed uncontrolled crossroads."
1954567,14010,9475,"A continuous-state version of discrete randomized shortest-paths, with application to path planning",2011,"This work investigates the continuous-state counterpart of the discrete randomized shortest-path framework (RSP, [23]) on a graph. Given a weighted directed graph G, the RSP considers the policy that minimizes the expected cost (exploitation) to reach a destination node from a source node, while maintaining a constant relative entropy spread in the graph (exploration). This results in a Boltzmann probability distribution on the (usually infinite) set of paths connecting the source node and the destination node, depending on an inverse temperature parameter θ. This framework defines a biased random walk on the graph that gradually favors low-cost paths as θ increases. It is shown that the continuous-state counterpart requires the solution of two partial differential equations - providing forward and backward variables - from which all the quantities of interest can be computed. For instance, the best local move is obtained by taking the gradient of the logarithm of one of these solutions, namely the backward variable. These partial differential equations are the socalled steady-state Bloch equations to which the Feynman-Kac formula provides a path integral solution. The RSP framework is therefore a discrete-state equivalent of the continuous Feynman-Kac diffusion process involving the Wiener measure. Finally, it is shown that the continuous-time continuous-state optimal randomized policy is obtained by solving a diffusion equation with an external drift provided by the gradient of the logarithm of the backward variable, playing the role of a potential."
891685,14010,8441,Iterative learning control for fault-tolerance in multi-phase permanent-magnet machines,2013,"Fault-tolerant control (FTC) techniques for multi-phase permanent magnet (PM) motors are usually designed to achieve maximum ripple-free torque under fault conditions with minimum ohmic losses. A widely accepted approach is based on flux distribution or back EMF (BEM) model of the machine to calculate healthy phase currents. This is essentially an open-loop technique where currents are determined offline (based on motor fault models) for each fault scenario. Therefore, it is highly model-dependent. Since torque pulsation due to open-circuit faults are periodic, learning and repetitive control algorithms are excellent choices to minimize torque ripple. In this paper, iterative learning control (ILC) is applied as a current control technique for recovering performance in multiphase PM motor drives under open-circuit fault conditions. ILC-based FTC needs torque measurement, but avoids the need for complicated fault detection and fault diagnosis algorithms. Furthermore, a BEM+ILC based FTC is proposed that initiates the learning from a model-based approximate guess (from the BEM method). Therefore, this method combines the advantages of both model information as well as robustness to model uncertainty through learning. Hence, the proposed method is well-suited for high performance safety-critical applications. Finite element analysis (FEA) results on a five-phase PM machine are presented for verification of the proposed control schemes."
2350614,14010,11104,P band penetration in tropical and boreal forests: Tomographical results,2011,"In this paper we discuss some relevant features observed concerning wave penetration at P-band in boreal and tropical forests. The discussion will be based on results obtained from the multi-polarimetric and multi-baseline data-sets relative to the forest sites within the Krycklan river catchment, Sweden, and the area of Paracou in French Guyana, collected in the frame of the ESA campaign BioSAR 2008 and TropiSAR 2009, respectively. The analysis is carried out by exploiting the SAR tomography technique, which allows to separate backscattering contributions from different heights within the vegetation layer. One first relevant result is relative to the difference between the vertical distribution of the backscattered power in the two investigated test sites. In the boreal forest site the most relevant scattering contributions are observed at the ground level, not only in copolarized channels but also in HV, whereas in the tropical forest the presence of scattering from the ground is poorer and the vegetation volume is well visible. Most relevant features of the investigated tropical forest site are those relative to the dependency of the vertical backscattering distribution with respect to topographic slope and forest biomass. In particular, the innermost forest layer is observed to be substantially invariant to topographic slopes, whereas the backscattered power at 30 m above the ground is observed to yield the best connection with forest biomass, resulting, in this case, in a correlation factor of 0.82 with respect to in-situ measurements at 125 m spatial resolution."
1148798,14010,8441,Design of reduced-order controllers using a set of measurements: Application to a DC servomotor,2013,"This paper presents a new control design approach for unknown SISO systems by using measurements. In control approaches existing in the literature, controllers are usually designed on the basis of mathematical models obtained by either using physical laws or via identification system using a set of measured data. However, due to the complex dynamics of real systems, such parametric models are only an approximation obtained after some simplifying assumptions. Therefore, the design of controllers based on a simplified model leads to a degradation in the expected performance for the closed-loop system. Our proposed approach is based on measurements to directly design controllers without going through the use of mathematical models. The principle of the proposed control methodology is to design fixed-structure controllers for which the error modulus between the closed-loop frequency response and a desired frequency response is bounded by given quantity. This problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem based on inequality constraints. The main advantage of our proposed approach is that the controller design is based only on a set of measurements, which allows to avoid errors associated with the identification process. Moreover, with such a proposed control method, it is guaranteed that the error between the computed and desired closed-loop frequency responses is less than a small quantity. Another feature of the proposed technique is that the structure of the controller can be selected a priori, which allows to design low-order controllers. A simulation application to measurement-based controller design for DC servomotors is presented to validate and illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach."
2112636,14010,11104,Landmine detection using an ensemble of continuous HMMs with multiple features,2011,"We propose a landmine detection algorithm using ground penetrating radar (GPR) data that uses multiple features and an ensemble of continuous hidden Markov models (CHMMs). Our approach is motivated by the need for different features and multiple models to capture the large variations of mine and clutter types and the different environmental conditions. First, for each feature representation, we fit one continuous HMM to each of the N alarm signatures. For each fitted model, we evaluate the log-likelihood of each sequence. This will result in one N × N log-likelihood distance matrix for each feature. These log-likelihood matrices are combined and partitioned to identify K clusters of alarms where each cluster contain alarms that are similar with respect to one or more features. Second, we learn the parameters of one HMM per group using the relevant features identified in the clustering phase. The mixture of all learned models would be used to build a descriptive model of the data. The third step of our approach consists of training a Neural Network (NN) to fuse the results of the mixture models and assign a final confidence value. Results on large and diverse Ground Penetrating Radar data collections show that the proposed approach can identify meaningful and coherent HMM models that describe different properties of the data. Our initial experiments have also indicated that the proposed mixture model outperforms the baseline mixture model that uses one single feature representation."
1796391,14010,11104,New improvements of the extended minimum cost flow phase unwrapping for processing multitemporal full resolution interferograms,2011,"We present an efficient space-time phase unwrapping (PhU) algorithm allowing us to analyze sequences of multitemporal full resolution differential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferograms for the generation of deformation time-series. The core of the proposed technique is represented by the extended minimum cost flow (EMCF) PhU algorithm. Our method is based on a joint analysis of the spatial and temporal relationships among a set of properly selected multitemporal differential interferograms. More specifically, the key idea is to split the complex MCF network problem into that of simpler sub-networks. Accordingly, we start by identifying and solving a primary network that involves a proper selection of coherent pixels of the computed interferograms, representing the backbone structure of the overall network. Subsequently, this result is applied for constraining the solution of the sub-networks connected to the primary one, involving the entire set of analyzed pixels. This task is achieved by solving a constrained optimization problem based on the computation of a Constrained Delaunay Triangulation in the Azimuth/Range domain. The experimental results, achieved by applying the proposed approach to a dataset consisting of European Remote Sensing (ERS) SAR data acquired, from June 1992 to August 2007 over the Napoli (Italy) bay area, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PhU approach.."
1117932,14010,11104,Compact reconnaissance imaging spectrometer for MARS (CRISM),2011,"The Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars CRISM (CRISM) carried aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), is the first visible-infrared spectrometer to fly on a NASA Mars mission. CRISM scientists are using the instrument to look for the residue of minerals that form in the presence of water: The ‘fingerprints’ left by evaporated hot springs, thermal vents, lakes or ponds. With unprecedented clarity, CRISM is mapping regions on the Martian surface at scales as small as 60feet (about 18 meters) across, when the spacecraft is 186 miles (300 kilometers) above the planet. CRISM is reading 544 ‘colors’ in reflected sunlight to detect certain minerals on the surface, including signature traces of past water. CRISM alone will generate more than 10 terabytes of data, enough to fill more than 15,000 compact discs. Given that quantity of data being returned by MROCRISM, this project partners with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) scientists of the CRISM team to assist in the data analysis process. The CRISM operations team has prototyped and will provide the necessary software analysis tools. In addition, the CRISM operations team will provide reduced data volume representations of the data as PNG files, accessible via a web interface without recourse to specialized user tools. The web interface allows me to recommend repeating certain of the CRISM observations as survey results indicate, and to enter notes on the features present in the images."
886057,14010,9475,Resource-aware model predictive control of spatially distributed processes using event-triggered communication,2013,"This work focuses on the design of a resource-aware model predictive control (MPC) system for spatially distributed processes with low-order dynamics and a limited number of output measurements. A reduced-order model that captures the dominant process dynamics is initially obtained and used to design a Lyapunov-based output feedback MPC. A finite-dimensional state observer is included in the sensors to generate estimates of the slow states of the infinite-dimensional systems which are broadcast over the network to update the states of the reduced-order model used in the MPC controller at each sampling time. Precise conditions that guarantee closed-loop stability under plant-model mismatch are derived and used to devise an event-triggered sensor-controller communication strategy that minimizes network utilization without jeopardizing closed-loop stability. The key idea is to monitor the model estimation error at each sampling time and suspend communication when the prescribed stability bounds obtained based on a forecast of the future evolution of the Lyapunov function are satisfied. At times when the model estimation error fails to satisfy the projected bound on the evolution of the Lyapunov function, the sensors are prompted to proactively transmit the observer-generated state estimates to update the model states and avert instability. Finally, the design and implementation of the proposed event-triggered MPC are illustrated using a diffusion-reaction process example."
813022,14010,8441,Response time re-scaling and Weber's law in adapting biological systems,2013,"Systems biology has revealed numerous examples of networks whose dynamic behavior is robust to system perturbations and noise. In many cases, this behavior arises from simple yet fundamental features of the system architecture. A well-studied example is the chemotactic response of Escherichia coli. In various models of this system, it is shown that simple assumptions on the receptor methylation dynamics lead to robust perfect adaptation of chemotactic activity. Recent experimental work has also shown that the transient E. coli chemotactic response is unchanged by a scaling of its ligand input signal; this behavior is called fold change detection (FCD), and is in agreement with earlier mathematical predictions. However, this prediction was based on very particular assumptions on the structure of the chemotaxis pathway. In this work, we begin by showing that behavior similar to FCD can be obtained under weaker conditions on the system structure. Namely, we show that under relaxed conditions, a scaling of the chemotaxis system's inputs leads to a time scaling of the output response. We propose that this may be a contributing factor to the robustness of the experimentally observed FCD. We further show that FCD is a special case of this time scaling behavior for which the time scaling factor of unity. We then proceed to extend the conditions for output time scaling to more general adapting systems, and demonstrate this time scaling behavior on a published model of the chemotaxis pathway of the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. This work therefore provides examples of how robust biological behavior can arise from simple yet realistic conditions on the underlying system structure."
1118548,14010,9475,Learning from time series: Supervised Aggregative Feature Extraction,2012,"Many modeling problems require to estimate a scalar output from one or more time series. Such problems are usually tackled by extracting a fixed number of features from the time series (like their statistical moments), with a consequent loss in information that leads to suboptimal predictive models. Moreover, feature extraction techniques usually make assumptions that are not met by real world settings (e.g. uniformly sampled time series of constant length), and fail to deliver a thorough methodology to deal with noisy data. In this paper a methodology based on functional learning is proposed to overcome the aforementioned problems; the proposed Supervised Aggregative Feature Extraction (SAFE) approach allows to derive continuous, smooth estimates of time series data (yielding aggregate local information), while simultaneously estimating a continuous shape function yielding optimal predictions. The SAFE paradigm enjoys several properties like closed form solution, incorporation of first and second order derivative information into the regressor matrix, interpretability of the generated functional predictor and the possibility to exploit Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces setting to yield nonlinear predictive models. Simulation studies are provided to highlight the strengths of the new methodology w.r.t. standard unsupervised feature selection approaches."
2438734,14010,20896,Poster Abstract: Involving a Sensor Network System in Core Datacenter Management Functions,2012,"In the recent decade, datacenters have emerged to play an increasingly important role in cloud-based computing systems. It is shown that wireless sensor networks (sensornets) can provide fine-grained measurement and flexible coverage for the datacenter platform, and help achieve better control and energy efficiency [1]-[3]. In these applications, sensor nodes are only passive information receivers, and the use has so far been limited to auxiliary functions as an intelligent replacement of the traditional wired and embedded sensors. We argue that the combined computational and networking capability of a sensor network enables it to interact with server clusters in a much more sophisticated way and perform essential functions in the datacenter system. We design a technology to incorporating the sensornet as a core part of the datacenter system and improve datacenter management and operations. The sensornet can be easily deployed in a cluster, with sensor nodes attached in an ad hoc manner to the compute servers, and provide key system functions including reprogramming, supplementary authentication, and network signaling. The datacenter administrator can manage a large number of servers through the multihop sensor network, verify the participating servers to be legitimate entities within the datacenter, and improve performance through a low-bandwidth but intelligent wireless network. Our initial results have shown that the system eliminates some of the security problems present in current LAN network based datacenter management system; and that the sensornet provides good physical authentication function without introducing long delays in cluster-wide operations."
1052047,14010,11104,Preservation of data for Earth system science - Towards a content standard,2012,"Various remote sensing agencies of the world have created a data rich environment for research and applications over the last three decades. Especially over the last decade, the volume and variety of data useful for Earth system science have increased quite rapidly. One of the key purposes of collecting these data and generating useful digital products containing derived geophysical parameters is to study the long-term trends in the Earth's behavior. Long-term observational data and derived products are essential for validating results from models that predict the future behavior of the Earth system. Given the significant resources expended in gathering the observational data and developing the derived products, it is important to preserve them for the benefit of future generations of users. Preservation involves maintaining the bits with no loss (or loss within scientifically acceptable bounds) as they move across systems as well as over time, ensuring readability over time, and providing for long-term understandability and repeatability of previously obtained results. In order to ensure long-term understandability and repeatability, it is necessary to identify all items of content that must be preserved and plan for such preservation. This paper discusses the need for a standard enumerating and describing such content items and reports on the progress made by NASA and the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP Federation) in the U.S. towards such a standard."
1178072,14010,11104,Extraction of saline land based on decision tree approach using Landsat TM DATA,2013,"The dynamic monitoring and mapping of soil salinization is a practical significance work at present. In this paper, the middle reaches of Heihe River, China, was taken as a study case to discuss the effectiveness of extracting saline land information applying decision tree approach, based on Landsat TM data acquired on Sep.23, 2007. Through visual interpretation and statistical analysis of spectral characteristic associated with field survey and Google Earth image with higher resolution, finally five feature variables: thermal infrared band (TM6), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the third component of MNF rotation (MNF3) and the wetness of K-T transformation (TC3) were selected to construct decision tree model by setting the proper threshold values. The research suggested that MNF3 is an optimal band to discriminate saline land from other object-grounds on condition of MNF<;-1. The water body and vegetation district can be extracted by NDVI and MNDWI, respectively. Combining MNF3, TC3 and TM6 can well obtain sandy land and farmland information. The overall accuracy of classification results achieves 85.34% and Kappa Coefficient is 0.795, both of which show the effectiveness and feasibility of decision tree approach for monitoring and mapping spatial distribution of soil salinization."
1599346,14010,9475,Inference of temporally evolving network dynamics with applications in biological systems,2011,"Modeling of biological signal pathways forms the basis of systems biology. Also, the problem of identifying dynamics of biological networks is of critical importance in order to understand biological systems. In this paper, we propose a data-driven inference scheme to identify dynamics with a local point of view, the Jacobian matrix. A graph model is a natural way to represent a biological signal pathway and doesn't require any constraints on dynamics such as mass action kinetics or Hill function representations, used in Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models. A graph is a set of vertices which represents state, and a set of edges which depicts the relationship or connection between two or more states. Once a system is abstracted by a graph, in order to identify the activity level of the corresponding interactions based on a given data set, we reformulate the problem as a Linear Quadratic (LQ) Optimal Control problem by transforming the unknown entries of the activity of edges into the control inputs of the LQ setting. In the formulation of the LQ problem, we use an adjacency map as a priori information and define a performance index which both drives the connectivity of the graph to match the biological data as well as generates a sparse network. Through simulation studies on simple examples, it is shown that this scheme can help to capture the topological change of a biological signal pathway and show the influence or activity of each edge over time. Also, we sketch briefly the potential application of this approach to correcting the graph model."
713066,14010,11104,VHF/UHF-band SAR imaging using circular tracks,2012,"Low frequency synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) in combination with change detection techniques can be used to search for stationary ground targets. In particular, the method has shown a great potential when vehicle-size objects are obscured by foliage. However. one possibility is to improve the detection capabilities to increase the aperture angle of the radar data acquisition to make sure that the strong cardinal responses of a typical vehicle are registered. This implies an angle of at least 180° to include the strongest (broadside) response when the target orientations are unknown. HF-VHF SAR data (20–90 MHz) have earlier successfully been exploited on this and now tests have also been conducted with the airborne VHF-UHF SAR system LORA (220-430 MHz) using the maximum angle 360°, i.e. a full circle. A first look on this data set indicates a possibility to obtain an extended response signature from the hidden targets compared to the corresponding images generated from the linear tracks made during the same flight mission. The image processing of circular tracks becomes more complex and precise processing of the imaging geometry is necessary, i.e. both accurate navigation data as well as a dense digital elevation model (DEM) of the illuminated ground segment."
1635106,14010,11104,Promotion of supervised classification for land use development,2013,"The dynamics of remote sensing (RS), a geographic information system (GIS) technique, and the applications of global positioning system (GPS) were used to respond to a wide geospatial need in Owerri Land use, in Nigeria. Promotion (further use) of supervised classification is an exclusive use of scientific analysis to decompose a supervised classification error. This method promoted community and economic development. The term promote, means further analysis for more applications of the error matrix, to gain knowledge of specific land use activities within different land use categories. The project finds that the regimes of the series of satellite imagery hold more data of information than the supervised classification alone. One of such knowledge or information was phase withdrawal of some land use categories, which was shared for agricultural and economic development, transportation planning, and Homeland Security management. The regimes of the land use and land cover change (LUCC) revealed some impact distribution on regional resources. It provided sufficient data and metadata for land use management. The results were geo-database development for land ownership and the Urban Pedestrian Resource Network (UPRN). This network created opportunities for minorities like women, who want to stay closer to home while actively engaged in business. This was due to market applications of a geo-database. The system is recommended for smaller cities, or rural communities with inherent land use management and development problems."
1602567,14010,9475,Near-optimal execution policies for demand-response contracts in electricity markets,2013,"Demand side participation is essential for achieving real-time energy balance in today's electricity grid. Demand-response contracts, where an electric utility company buys options from consumers to reduce their load in future, are one of the important tools to increase the demand-side participation. In this paper, we consider the operational problem of optimally exercising the available contracts over the planning horizon such that the total cost to satisfy the demand is minimized. In particular, we consider the objective of minimizing the sum of the expected l β -norm of the load deviations from given thresholds and the contract execution costs over the planning horizon. We present a data driven near-optimal algorithm for the contract execution problem. Our algorithm is a sample average approximation (SAA) based and we provide a sample complexity bound on the number of demand samples required to compute a (1 + e)-approximate policy for any e > 0. Our SAA algorithm is quite general and can be adapted to quite general demand models and objective function. For the special case where the demand in each period is i.i.d., we show that a static solution is optimal for the dynamic problem. We also conduct a numerical study to compare the performance of our SAA based DP algorithm. Our numerical experiments show that we can achieve a (1+e)-approximation in significantly smaller number of samples than what is implied by the theoretical bounds. Moreover, the structure of the approximate policy also shows that it can be well approximated by a simple piecewise linear function of the state."
800182,14010,11104,Tree cover extraction from 50 cm worldview2 imagery: A comparison of image processing techniques,2013,"High resolution remote sensing is a valuable tool for quantifying the distribution and density of trees with applications ranging from forest inventory, mapping urban parklands to understanding impacts on soil nutrient and carbon dynamics in farming land. The present study aims to compare the accuracy of different remote sensing techniques for delineating the tree cover in 50 cm resolution WorldView2 imagery of farmland. An image of farmland comprising pastures, remnant vegetation and woodland was initially classified into six classes, namely tree cover, bare soil, rock outcrop, natural pasture, degraded pasture and water body using different techniques. Pixel based classification based on all four available wavebands, were tested and an overall classification accuracy of 96.8% and 72.9 % were achieved for supervised and unsupervised techniques. Object based segmentation and subsequent classification yielded an improved overall classification accuracy of 98.3%. Addition of a fifth NDVI layer to the available wavebands did improve the accuracy but not significantly (98.1%, approx 1.3%). In addition to the improvements in overall classification accuracy, a visual inspections of results from the different methods indicated the object based method to yield a more `realistic' result, avoiding the `salt and pepper' effects apparent in the pixel-based methods. Overall, object based classification hence is considered more suitable for tree cover extraction from high resolution images."
2262631,14010,20896,Investigating Communication Infrastructure of Next Generation Air Traffic Management,2012,"Growing demand for use of the National Airspace System (NAS) has resulted in research and development programs to modernize the air traffic control system. The primary focus of the US FAA's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) plan is to transform the air transportation system into a more flexible, adaptive, and highly automated system capable of handling two to three times the current traffic. According to the NextGen plan, Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) is designed to improve the safety, capacity, and efficiency of the NAS. ADS-B works by broadcasting flight information such as the flight number, position, speed and intent using satellite-based navigation systems, to other aircraft or air traffic control facilities. Our research interests focus on the interoperability of the ADS-B data link with existing surveillance systems and operational ability of ADS-B to assist the flight crew by meeting safety assurance. Because the NAS involves a multitude of inter-acting agents and technologies, the high complexity of integrated sensing and decision support for the air traffic control is the main challenge. We have developed a simulation environment which includes an air traffic model, existing surveillance systems, ADS-B systems, and wireless channel model. The critical issue of the interoperability and collaboration between existing systems and ADS-B is validated. Two parts of the interference issue are analysed: (1) interference from ADS-B to existing systems, and (2) interference from existing systems to the ADS-B. It is shown that ADS-B meets the performance requirements of both air-to-ground and air-to-air ranges. Furthermore, the effect of ground surveillance systems and aircraft density to the ADS-B performance along the flight path is analysed."
1023619,14010,9475,Scheduling and cooperative control of electric vehicles' charging at highway service stations,2014,"Due to their limited ranges, electric vehicles (EVs) need to be periodically charged during their long-distance travels on a highway. Compared to the fossil-fuel powered vehicles, the charging of a single EV takes much more time (up to 30 mins versus 2 mins). As the number of EVs on highways increases, adequate charging infrastructure needs to be put in place. Nonetheless waiting times for EVs to get charged at service stations could still vary significantly unless an appropriate scheduling coordination is in place and individual EVs make correct decisions about their choice of charging locations. This paper attempts to address both the system-level scheduling problem and the individual control problem, while requiring only distributed information about EVs and their charging at service stations along a highway. Specifically, we first develop a higher-level distributed scheduling algorithm to optimize the operation of the overall charging network. The scheduling algorithm uses only local information of traffic flows measured at the neighboring service stations (nodes), and it aims at adjusting the percentage of the EVs to be charged at individual stations so that all the charging resources along the highway are well (uniformly) utilized and the total waiting time is minimized. Then, a lower level cooperative control law is designed for individual EVs to decide whether or not it should charge its battery when approaching a specific service station by meeting the published scheduling level while taking into account its own battery constraint. Analytical designs are presented and their performance improvement is illustrated using simulation."
1181524,14010,11104,Detection and classification of oil spill and look-alike spots from SAR imagery using an Artificial Neural Network,2012,"Oil spills represent a major threat to ocean ecosystems and their health. The recent incident in the Gulf of Mexico demonstrates the potentially catastrophic nature of offshore oil spills. Illicit pollution requires continuous monitoring and satellite remote sensing technology represents an attractive option for operational oil spill detection. Previous studies have shown that active microwave satellite sensors, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be effectively used for the detection and classification of oil spills. Oil spills appear as dark spots in SAR images. However, similar dark spots may arise from a range of unrelated meteorological and oceanographic phenomena, resulting in misidentification. A major focus of research in this area is the development of algorithms to distinguish oil spills from ‘look-alikes’. This paper describes the development of a new approach to SAR oil spill detection using two different Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The first ANN segments a SAR image to identify pixels belonging to candidate oil spill features. A set of statistical feature parameters are then extracted and divided into subsets to facilitate sensitivity analyses. The second ANN classifies objects into oil spills or look-alikes according to their feature parameters. A pilot study employed sixty-two ERS-2 SAR and ENVSAT ASAR images of verified oil spills or look-alikes to train and evaluate the algorithm. Overall accuracies of 96.52 % were obtained for pixel segmentation and 95.2 % for feature classification. The segmentation approach outperformed established edge detection and adaptive thresholding techniques. An analysis of feature descriptors in the classification stage highlighted the importance of image gradient information."
1400314,14010,9475,Dynamic mechanism design in correlated environments,2013,"We consider the problem of implementing a principal's decision truthfully in a private-value, correlated environment in which agents receive information over time. This setting comprises a deviation from the literature of dynamic mechanism design that typically employs the assumption that the distribution of an agent's private signal is independent of other agents' private information history conditional on past public decisions. We derive sufficient conditions for designing monetary transfers that guarantee implementation of the desired policy in a periodic expost incentive compatible equilibrium. For risk neutral agents in a finite state, finite action Markovian environment this set of sufficient conditions reduces to a finite set of linear inequalities. This is an appealing feature given that the agent is faced with a partial observation stochastic optimization problem with progressively increasing information state. The class of mechanisms considered in our methodology include the dynamic VCG algorithm that has been developed for the case where agents' dynamics are coupled only through the principal's decision. Besides implementing the desired policy, the principal may want to impose specifications on the expected revenue or model her uncertainty regarding her knowledge of agents' perceived environment. We show how our conditions for periodic ex post incentive compatibility can be incorporated as part of a robust optimization approach to policy implementation that takes these additional requirements into account."
847421,14010,11104,Impact of SAR data quantization on TanDEM-X performance,2013,"Quantization of SAR raw data represents an aspect of primary importance, since the number of bits used for radar signal digitization on the one hand controls the on-board memory consumption and the data volume to be transmitted on the ground, and on the other hand affects directly the performance of the SAR images. The TanDEM-X mission started in 2010 and comprises the two twin satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X. Its primary objective is the generation of a worldwide and consistent digital elevation model (DEM) with an unprecedented accuracy. The two satellites fly in close orbit configuration and act as a large single-pass radar interferometer with the adaptability for flexible baseline selection [1]. In this paper, the impact of quantization on bistatic TanDEM-X data is evaluated. First, the effect on the Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ) is investigated. Then, the dependence of interferometric coherence on raw data quantization is assessed, and the impact on relative height accuracy is estimated from TanDEM-X repeated acquisitions. A dedicated analysis aimed at evaluating interferometric performance in presence of inhomogeneities in the backscatter response (the so-called low scatterer suppression) is performed. Based on the presented results, the resource allocation strategy for the second global coverage of TanDEM-X has been consequently adapted to further improve the final DEM performance."
1624450,14010,9475,On the basics for simulation of feedback-based stock trading strategies: An invited tutorial session,2013,"This paper provides an overview of our CDC tutorial session covering the basics of simulation and performance evaluation associated with stock trading via feedback control methods. The specific trading algorithms which we describe fall under the umbrella of “pure technical analysis” in that they are model-free with no parametrization of the stock-price process assumed. True to technical analysis, we adopt the point of view that the stock price p(t) is an external input with no predictive model for its evolution. The feedback controller adapts the investment level I(t) based on the evolution of the trading gains or losses over time. In the introductory talk, it is explained how this point of view “opens doors” for new research contributions from the control community. The simulations which we consider are of two types: In some cases, the controller's performance is studied using synthetic classes of stock prices such as Geometric Brownian Motion. In other cases, real historical prices are brought into play. We refer to such a real-price simulation as a “backtest.” Once we cover the trading mechanics, the notion of “benchmark price classes,” data acquisition and coding of algorithms, the focal point becomes performance evaluation. That is, with g(t) denoting cumulative gains or losses, we describe a number of metrics which are used to evaluate the performance associated with the trajectory pair (I(·), g(·)). Whereas the first half of the tutorial concentrates on trading a single stock, the last half addresses multi-asset portfolios, educational aspects and the notion of trading competitions."
1426105,14010,11104,Joint electrical and hydrological inversion for reconstruction of subsurface contaminant source zones,2012,"Remediation of sites polluted by hazardous chemicals such as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) represents an important environmental problem due to the large scale threat these releases pose to water supplies throughout the world. Successful cleanup and restoration relies on methods to characterize the source zone structure prior to remediation and subsequently to monitor the corresponding dissolved chemical levels. This paper develops and implements a new model-based approach to DNAPL source zone characterization based on the joint inversion of hydrological and geophysical data. To model the interaction of groundwater with the contaminant source zone, a fully three dimensional (3D) flow and transport model is used to provide the downstream contaminant concentrations associated to the source zone saturation distribution. As the geophysical modality we utilize electrical resistance tomography (ERT) where electric potential measurements related to the electrical properties of the medium are obtained cross gradient to the water flow direction. The inversion technique is based on the parametric level set method (PaLS) which provides for the recovery of the geometric profiles of the low and high saturation regions (corresponding to the ganglia and the pooling regions) and low order characterizations of the spatial variability within each region. The performance of our proposed algorithm is examined and discussed through the reconstruction of some challenging source zone architectures."
1555537,14010,11104,A neural network architecture combining VHR SAR and multispectral data for precision farming in viticulture,2014,"Concurrent availability of VHR (Very High Resolution) images at both optical and microwave bands opens new challenges in many applicative scenarios of Earth Observation (EO). In particular this is true for precision farming activities where the retrieval on the metric scale of biophysical parameters and of information regarding vegetation spatial distributions can be very effective in supporting farmers during the production cycles. However, the inversion problem giving the value of the desired variable from the measured electromagnetic quantities (the image data) can be very complex and the nonlinear relationships involved need to be handled by suitable algorithms. In this paper a complete processing scheme providing quantities of interest for precision viticulture from data provided by WorldView-2 (WV2) and COSMOSkyMed (CSK) space platforms is presented. Once the appropriate season time was selected, the satellite data have been acquired over the test area within a limited time window and concurrently with the collection of the groundtruth. The workflow, besides adequate pre-processing steps, includes two neural networks (NN) modules, one is dedicated to the extraction of a restricted number of nonlinear components from the WV2 data, the other one to the actual inversion problem. The obtained results seem to be satisfactory with respect to the requirements provided by the users."
1698054,14010,11104,Using radar to detect flooding in arid wetlands and rivers,2012,"The arid zone of Australia is an environment with ‘boom and bust’ dynamics; where years of drought can be followed by periodic flash flooding. Major floods occurred along 500km of the Paroo River in March 2010 at levels unequaled since 2000. Dual polarization (HH/HV) L-Band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data was obtained from the Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) to evaluate its use for mapping flooding over an area of high conservation value floodplain wetlands. The data were shown to be highly informative for mapping flooded classes and provide an alternative data source to optical imagery in the presence of cloud cover. Due to radar speckle, segmentation was used to partition the scenes within eCognition Developer. Classification was performed on image objects using decision rules based on field verified radar backscatter thresholds of classes and change detection. The methods developed for single and multiple images provide a framework for operational mapping and monitoring water over time, as well as a rapid response strategy for flood emergencies. Future work on image transforms and research on the interoperability of SAR and optical data will aim to improve differentiation of wetland classes."
1047221,14010,11104,NWP ocean calibration of Ku-band scatterometers,2012,"Calibration procedures over the ocean using forecast winds have the advantage that they may be applied over a large portion of the globe and consequently may provide accurate results over a relatively short period. Ocean calibration has been applied successfully for the European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS) and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) C-band fan-beam scatterometer wind products at KNMI. The OceanSat-2 rotating pencil-beam scatterometer (OSCAT) uses a Ku-band radar wavelength (13.515 GHz) which is strongly affected by the presence of rain within a scatterometer wind vector cell (WVC). In this paper, The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) L2A data and 50km resolution L2B data processed by the OSCAT Wind Data Processor (OWDP) software, which is being developed by the KNMI scatterometer group, and include European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) equivalent-neutral winds, are successfully used in OSCAT NWP ocean calibration (NOC). With the NOC results obtained, the backscatter is corrected and wind retrieval statistics between ECWMF NWP winds and OSCAT NOC-corrected winds are computed and shown to be improved w.r.t. the OSCAT winds without NOC corrections applied. Based on the KNMI QC(Quality Control) flag, the rain effects to Ku-band NWP ocean calibration are investigated and NOC corrections based on WVCs that pass the QC are about 0.1dB lower than the NOC corrections without the QC applied. The best wind retrieval statistics are thus effectively obtained after that the QC-ed NOC corrections are applied on Ku-band OSCAT scatterometer backscatter data."
2245975,14010,20896,A Novel CPS System for Evaluating a Neural-Machine Interface for Artificial Legs,2011,"This paper presents a novel cyber physical system (CPS) that senses signals from two physical systems -- a human neuromuscular control system and a mechanical prosthesis -- to drive a cyber virtual reality (VR) system for the purpose of evaluating a neural-machine interface (NMI) for artificial legs. Novel cyber techniques are proposed to tackle two fundamental challenges in this CPS system: inherent computation complexity for accurately identifying user's intended movements and real-time 3D rendering of a virtual avatar and environment on the cyber system. A neuromuscular-mechanical fusion algorithm is developed to decipher user intent. The decisions are then fed into the virtual reality cyber system to drive real-time motion of an avatar emulating exactly intended movements of the user. The algorithms for intent recognition and 3D VR rendering are specifically tailored to multi-core GPUs. The designed CPS system is tested on human subjects wearing prostheses. The results have shown that fusion of neuromuscular control and mechanical information improves the accuracy for user intent classification, compared to the interface based on either neuromuscular or mechanical information alone. Additionally, we find orders of magnitude speedup of GPUs over general purpose PCs, making the real-time application possible. Our prototype implementation demonstrates the feasibility of using neuromuscular-mechanical fusion to drive virtual reality in real time, which can be an effective evaluation and training tool for leg amputees to neurally control their artificial legs."

In this algorithm, we couple the Ross Thick-Li Sparse Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model and the atmospheric radiative transfer model. Assuming that the surface bidirectional reflective property is unchanged during a short period, usually 2–4 days and aerosol characteristics has a high temporal variation but is consistent spatially, then we can obtain AOD and BRDF parameters jointly by numerical iterative technique.

684564,14010,20896,Optimal Cross-Layer Design of Sampling Rate Adaptation and Network Scheduling for Wireless Networked Control Systems,2012,"Wireless Networked Control Systems (NCS) are increasingly deployed to monitor and control Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To achieve and maintain a desirable level of performance, NCS face significant challenges posed by the scarce wireless resource and network dynamics. In this paper, we consider NCS consisting of multiple physical plant and digital controller pairs communicating over a multi-hop wireless network. The control objective is that the plants follow the reference trajectories provided by the controllers. This paper presents a novel optimization formulation for minimizing the tracking error due to (1) discretization and (2) packet delay and loss. The optimization problem maximizes a utility function that characterizes the relationship between the sampling rate and the capability of disturbance rejection of the control system. The constraints come from the wireless network capacity and the delay requirement of the control system. The solution leads to a joint design of sampling rate adaptation and network scheduling, which can be naturally deployed over existing networking systems which have a layered architecture. Based on a passivity-based control framework, we show that the proposed cross-layer design can achieve both stability and performance optimality. Simulation studies conducted in an integrated simulation environment consisting of Matlab/Simulink and ns-2 demonstrate that our algorithm is able to provide agile and stable sampling rate adaptation and achieve optimal NCS performance."
867751,14010,11104,Analysis of homeland security and economic survey using special missions unmanned aerial vehicle utilities,2012,"Infrastructure protection [1] has become obvious that the successful use of unmanned aerial vehicles is now a requirement in homeland security. The success lies with the fact that these vehicles collect and process data, gather intelligence, and execute commands with feedbacks. The feedbacks are sent to different platforms for further analysis, which reveals that the infusion of such technology into homeland security management is a strong statement of needs and purpose. To meet the challenges posed by technology modeling in homeland security, a mission that measures or countermeasures terror plots must deploy a vehicle of a transportation system against the target-and-delivery systems (TADS) terrorists use in plotting and reaching their targets. This paper examined threats and counter responsibilities that require the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The objective is to identify domestic/international threats and special missions of UAVs that measures or counter-measures defined threats, without collateral loss or compromise of the safety and privacy of the general public. The result restricted UAVs' special missions to border counties if/when necessary. Acknowledgement: This material is based upon work supported by the US.

805521,14010,9475,Stable utility design for distributed resource allocation,2014,"The framework of resource allocation games is becoming an increasingly popular modeling choice for distributed control and optimization. In recent years, this approach has evolved into the paradigm of game-theoretic control, which consists of first modeling the interaction between the distributed agents as a strategic form game, and then designing local utility functions for these agents such that the resulting game possesses a stable outcome (e.g., a pure Nash equilibrium) that is efficient (e.g., good “price of anarchy” properties). One then appeals to the large, existing literature on learning in games for distributed algorithms for agents that guarantee convergence to such an equilibrium. An important first problem is to obtain a characterization of stable utility designs, that is, those that guarantee equilibrium existence for a large class of games. Recent work has explored this question in the general, multiselection context, that is, when agents are allowed to choose more than one resource at a time, showing that the only stable utility designs are the so-called “weighted Shapley values”. It remains an open problem to obtain a similar characterization in the single-selection context, which several practical problems such as vehicle target assignment, sensor coverage, etc. fall into. We survey recent work in the multi-selection scenario, and show that even though other utility designs become stable for specific single-selection applications, perhaps surprisingly, in a broader context, the limitation to “weighted Shapley value” utility design continues to prevail."
1860946,14010,11104,Techniques based on Support Vector Machines for cloud detection on QuickBird satellite imagery,2011,"Purpose of this work is the study of cloud detection techniques. This work identifies the cloud cover of optical images acquired by the QuickBird satellite, comparing these with others of the same area, acquired by Landsat 7 in which there are no clouds. The images are combined using an early fusion technique [1]. The tool exploits the neighborhood model [2] for increasing the amount of information for the training set and the Singular Value Decomposition for carrying out the feature extraction [3]. In order to introduce these structures into thematic classification tasks by SVMs it was necessary develop a tree kernel function based on tree kernel function defined in SVM-LightTK. The aim of the tree kernel function is evaluate the similarity level between a generic couples of tree structures. In this paper we report the results obtained comparing the performance of different approaches in cloud classification problem. The final purpose is the production of cloud cover maps. Throughout such different experimental setups we measured the capabilities of each algorithm under different points of view. First of all, we considered the classification accuracy by computing traditional parameter such as overall accuracy. A second analysis regarded the efforts that are required in the design of optimal algorithms. Indeed, these techniques are characterized by different parameters that have to be appropriately tuned in order to obtain the best performance. Finally the robustness of the techniques has been also considered. In particular the classification accuracy has been evaluated also for images not considered in the training phase."
1741556,14010,9475,Flexible and cost efficient power consumption using economic MPC a supermarket refrigeration benchmark,2011,"Supermarket refrigeration consumes substantial amounts of energy. However due to the thermal capacity of the refrigerated goods, parts of the cooling capacity delivered can be shifted in time without deteriorating the food quality. In this paper we introduce a novel economic-optimizing MPC scheme that reduces operating costs by utilizing the thermal storage capabilities. In the study we specifically address advantages coming from daily variations in outdoor temperature and electricity prices but other aspects such as peak load reduction are also considered. An important contribution of this paper is also the formulation of a new cost function for our proposed power management system. This means the refrigeration system is enabled to contribute with ancillary services to the balancing power market. Since significant amounts of regulating power are needed for a higher penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, this feature will be in high demand in a future intelligent power grid (Smart Grid). Our perspective is seen from the refrigeration system but, as we demonstrate, the involvement in the balancing market can be economically beneficial for the system itself, while delivering crucial services to the Smart Grid. We simulate the system using models validated against data from real supermarkets as well as weather data and spot and regulating power prices from the Nordic power market."
2017636,14010,20896,On Resource Overbooking in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,2012,"Large variations in the execution times of algorithms characterize many cyber-physical systems (CPS). For example, variations arise in the case of visual object-tracking tasks, whose execution times depend on the contents of the current field of view of the camera. In this paper, we study such a scenario in a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system with a camera that must detect objects in a variety of conditions ranging from the simple to the complex. Given resource, weight and size constraints, such cyber-physical systems do not have the resources to satisfy the hard-real-time requirements of safe flight along with the need to process highly variable workloads at the highest quality and resolution levels. Hence, tradeoffs have to be made in real-time across multiple levels of criticality of running tasks and their operating points. Specifically, the utility derived from tracking an increasing number of objects may saturate when the mission software can no longer perform the required processing on each individual object. In this paper, we evaluate a new approach called ZS-QRAM (Zero-Slack QoS-based Resource Allocation Model) that maximizes the UAV system utility by explicitly taking into account the diminishing returns on tracking an increasing number of objects. We perform a detailed evaluation of our approach on our UAV system to clearly demonstrate its benefits."
898133,14010,9475,A non-linear MPC based Motion Cueing implementation for a 9 DOFs dynamic simulator platform,2014,"The use of dynamical driving simulators is nowadays common practice in many different application fields, such as driver training, vehicle development, and medical studies. Platforms with different mechanical structure are designed, depending on the particular application and the corresponding targeted market. The effectiveness of such devices is related to their capabilities of well reproducing the driving feelings, hence it is crucial that the motion control strategies generate both realistic and feasible signals to the platform, to assure that it is kept within its limited operation space. Such strategies are called Motion Cueing Algorithms (MCAs), and they are clearly tailored to the particular mechanical structure of the device. In this paper we describe an MCA based on non linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) techniques for a simulator of new conception, that consists of an hexapod over a flat base moved by a tripod, thus exhibiting highly non linear behaviour. The procedure is based on previous works where a linear, MPC-based MCA has been applied to a simpler device. The algorithm has been evaluated on a simulation environment, and a first implementation on the real device is in progress. Preliminary results show that a full exploitation of the working area is achieved, while managing at best all the limitations given by the particular structure and preserving the ease of tune and intuitiveness of the linear approach."
1065158,14010,11104,Forest height estimation using semi-individual tree detection in multi-spectral 3D aerial DMC data,2012,"The increasing availability of accurate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of nation-wide cover has opened new possibilities to produce accurate forest variable estimation using 3D data acquired from aerial imagery. Such data can be produced by automatic matching of stereo images and photogrammetric modeling of the forest canopy height. Using existing accurate DEM information, the forest canopy height above ground is then easily assessed. Today, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is frequently used to capture data for accurate estimation of variables to be used in forest management planning. Recent studies in Scandinavia show estimation accuracies almost as accurate as ALS, using 3D data obtained from standard aerial imagery, at least for the most important forest variables. So far mainly area-based estimation methods at field plot or raster cell level have been studied. This paper reports early results from applying a single-tree modeling approach, corresponding to the Semi-ITC (Individual Tree Crown) method, commonly used in ALS-based applications, using 3D data acquired from aerial DMC imagery. Here, a simplified Semi-ITC method was used to estimate tree height at segment level. The Root Mean Square Error of estimating the maximum tree height was 34% (of the true mean maximum tree height). Clearly, the methodology used shows promising results and has potential to be used in forest management planning."
1017481,14010,20896,Low power programmable architecture for periodic activity monitoring,2013,"Body sensor networks (BSNs) are considered a great example for cyber-physical systems due to their close coupling with human body. Activity monitoring is one of the numerous applications of BSNs. Continuous and real-time monitoring of human activities has many applications in healthcare and wellness domains. BSNs utilizing light-weight wearable computers and equipped with inertial sensors are highly suitable for real-time activity monitoring. However, power requirement is a major obstacle for miniaturization of these wearable systems, due to the need for sizable batteries, and also limits the life time of the system. In this paper, we propose a low-power programmable signal processing architecture for dynamic and periodic activity monitoring applications which utilizes the properties of the physical world ( i.e ., human body movements) to reduce the power consumption of the system. The significant power reduction is achieved by performing signal processing in a tiered-fashion and removing the signals that are not of interest as early as possible. Our proposed architecture uses wavelet decomposition and is favorable for the discrimination of periodic activities. The experimental results show that our architecture achieves 75.7% power saving while maintaining 96.9% sensitivity in the detection of target actions, compared with the scenario where the signal processing is not performed in tiered-fashion. This creates opportunities to enable the next generation of self-powered wearable computers."

The Portuguese Meteorological Institute hosts the Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF). The primary objective of the LSA-SAF is to provide added-value products for the meteorological and environmental science communities with main applications in the fields of climate modeling, environmental management, natural hazards management, and climate change detection. Since 2005 data from Meteosat Second Generation satellite are routinely processed in near real time by the LSA-SAF operational system in Lisbon. Presently, the delivered operational products comprise land surface albedo and temperature, shortwave and long-wave downwelling radiation fluxes, vegetation parameters and snow cover. After more than ten years (1999–2011) of research, development, and progressive operational activities, a summary of characteristics and performances of albedo and downwelling shortwave (DSSF) products is presented (Sections 2 and 3). The relevance of LSA-SAF albedo product is analyzed through a weather forecast model (ALADIN) in order to account for the inter-annual spatial and temporal variability (Section 4). The added value brought by the use of LSA-SAF shortwave and long-wave products is also diagnosed through SURFEX Land Surface Models (LSM) simulations with the surface temperature, the water content and the energy fluxes (Section 4). Perspectives of the LSA-SAF project are finally stressed (Section 5–6)."
1532418,14010,9475,Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Stabilizability subject to Quadratic Invariance,2011,"In this paper we deal with the problem of stabilizing linear, time-invariant plants using feedback control configurations that are subject to sparsity constraints. Recent results show that given a strongly stabilizable plant, the class of all stabilizing controllers that satisfy certain given sparsity constraints admits a convex representation via Zames's Q-parametrization. More precisely, if the pre-specified sparsity constraints imposed on the controller are quadratically invariant with respect to the plant, then such a convex representation is guaranteed to exist. The most useful feature of the aforementioned results is that the sparsity constraints on the controller can be recast as convex constraints on the Q-parameter, which makes this approach suitable for optimal controller design (in the ℋ 2  sense) using numerical tools readily available from the classical, centralized optimal ℋ 2  synthesis. All these procedures rely crucially on the fact that some stabilizing controller that verifies the imposed sparsity constraints is a priori known, while design procedures for such a controller to initialize the aforementioned optimization schemes are not yet available. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for such a plant to be stabilizable with a controller having the given sparsity pattern. These conditions are formulated in terms of the existence of a doubly coprime factorization of the plant with additional sparsity constraints on certain factors. We show that the computation of such a factorization is equivalent to solving an exact model-matching problem. We also give the parametrization of the set of all decentralized stabilizing controllers by imposing additional constraints on the Youla parameter. These constraints are for the Youla parameter to lie in the set of all stable transfer function matrices belonging to a certain linear subspace."
1612567,14010,11104,Improved signal unmixing of vegetation using sparse group selection,2013,"Recently, signal unmixing was proposed in remote sensing with the goal to infer physical parameters of materials of interest, such as vegetation, on the ground. The typical approach uses large collections of pure spectra, called spectral libraries, in which many possible states of the vegetation are modeled by simulated or on-site acquired spectra. Spectra randomly selected from these libraries are used as input to dedicated unmixing methods, such as Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). The spectra leading to the lowest reconstruction error are considered to be representative for the materials present in the pixel, such that the physical parameters of the ground vegetation can be inferred. However, the large number of spectra in the library imposes limits to the performance of this combinatorial approach, mainly related to running time constraints. In this paper, we propose the inclusion of a pre-processing step in the processing chain, based on the group lasso, which has the goal of selecting groups of signatures likely to be present in the mixtures. In this sense, the Group Sparse Unmixing via variable Splitting and Augmented Lagrangian (GSUnSAL) algorithm is used. The signatures contained in the groups selected by GSUnSAL are then used as input for MESMA. Our experiments using a real dataset acquired by an ASD spectrometer in a South-African orchard show that the proposed approach introduces important improvements in the signal unmixing solutions."
1122259,14010,9475,Reducing packet loss bursts in a wireless mesh network for stochastic bounds on estimation error,2011,"A big challenge for wireless networked control systems is how to design the underlying networking algorithms and protocols to provide high reliability, defined as the end-to-end probability of packet delivery, despite the high packet loss rates of individual wireless links. This paper formulates the problem of jointly designing a set of packet forwarding policies on a multipath mesh network to meet control application requirements. We derive several results to help understand the problem space. First, we demonstrate that some common approaches, like applying a single forwarding policy to all packets or always routing packets on disjoint paths, are not optimal for the application when the links are bursty. Second, we introduce the notion of dominance to give a partial ordering to sets of forwarding policies, used to prove that an optimal policy schedules all outgoing links at each node and that an upper bound on the performance attained by unicast forwarding policies on the network graph can be computed assuming a flooding policy. Third, we demonstrate how to convert application performance metrics to packet forwarding policy objectives, using the probability that the error covariance of a Kalman filter stays within a bound as our application metric. Fourth, we provide an algorithm to compute the joint probability mass function that a sequence of packets are delivered, given a set of policies and a network graph. Finally, we describe how to obtain optimal policies via an exhaustive search, motivating future research for more computationally efficient solutions."

The study site is located in Tahe County, Heilongjiang Province, China, and two scenes of quad-polarization Radarsat-2 SAR images were acquired. the land cover classification of single-temporal POLSAR image by SVM, and multi-temporal POLSAR image by SVM and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) is studied separately. Then all the classification results are evaluated. Some conclusions can be got according to the analysis of all results and accuracy: Firstly, it is difficult to distinguish the different types of vegetation for the similar scattering among them in July. However, water, whose scattering characteristic is simplex, can be distinguished from others easily. Scondly, in October, the scattering characteristics among forest, shrub, grass, crop are different, therefore it is easy to distinguish vegetation because of their one from others in this period. But for water, with reduced in winter, the river width narrows, compared with it in summer, water classification accuracy is lower in this period. Thirdly, joint July and October SAR data for classification, can offset espective their own disadvantages. and improve overall accuracy. And the last one, With the characteristics that different probability density distribution, small sample, non-linear and so on, SVM shows the wide applicability."
1479455,14010,9475,On Nash equilibria in duopolistic power markets subject to make-whole uplift,2012,"We consider a duopolistic power market in which firms bid their offer functions while abiding by capacity constraints. Minimal cost allocation decisions and marginal cost prices are determined through the solution of two optimization problems, the first a mixed-integer linear program (the unit commitment problem) and the second a related linear program (the economic dispatch problem) that has constraints derived from the solution of the commitmemt problem. Traditional marginal-cost pricing mechanisms have relied on using the dual variables associated with the supply-demand constraints from the dispatch problem. Unfortunately, such mechanisms fail to cover the cost of start-up and energy costs faced by dispatched generators. In existing markets, one attempt at a remedy is by providing every dispatched generator with an expost out of market settlement called a make-whole uplift. Given the presence of such an uplift mechanism, this paper seeks to characterize the nature of equilibria in duopolistic settings. The two main conclusions of our analysis are: 1) Pure Nash equilibria are identified when one firm can supply the entire demand; 2) Otherwise, it is shown that mixed-strategy Nash equilibria exist, and these equilibria can be characterized by two coupled differential equations. These results provide a framework for further analysis of electricity markets, and in particular the true value of make-whole uplift payments in a strategic setting."
1095150,14010,11104,Global trends in tropospheric NO 2 observed from space,2012,"Here we present results of a global trend analysis using nearly a decade of NO 2  observations acquired by the SCIA-MACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY) instrument onboard the Envisat satellite platform. Monthly average tropospheric NO 2  column data was acquired for the period between August 2002 and August 2011. A trend analysis was subsequently performed by fitting a statistical model including a seasonal cycle and linear trend to the time series extracted at each grid cell. The linear trend component and the trend uncertainty were then mapped spatially at both regional and global scales. The results show that spatially contiguous areas of significantly increasing NO 2  levels are found primarily in Eastern China. In addition, many urban agglomerations in Asia and the Middle East similarly exhibit significantly increasing trends, with Dhaka in Bangladesh being the megacity with the most rapid relative increase during the study period. In contrast, significantly decreasing trends in NO 2  levels exist over large parts of Europe and the Eastern United States. The satellite-derived time series were further analysed with respect to identification of the impact of the 2008/2009 economic crisis. European trends obtained from the satellite analysis are also compared with corresponding trends computed using data of the EMEP model, as well as with NO 2  trends calculated from station observations throughout Europe."
1446718,14010,8441,Optimal control of PDE-based systems by using a finite-dimensional approximation scheme,2013,"The design of closed-loop finite-dimensional controllers for systems described by partial differential equations is tackled by combining tools borrowed by research areas such as approximation and operator theory. The proposed paradigm is based on the idea of using operators to account for the dynamics, regulator, and measurement mappings. Specifically, we rely on a well-established setting of Banach spaces, which is well-suited to supporting the generality of the approach. First, we define a class of Lipschitz operators with finite seminorm and formulate a tracking problem in the Banach spaces of real-valued functions. Second, we search for controllers that ensure stability and minimize a given performance index. The design of such regulators is achieved by resorting to an approximation scheme based on the extended Ritz method. Such a scheme consists in constraining the regulation operator to take on a fixed structure, where a finite number of free parameters can be suitably chosen. The problem is then reduced to a mathematical programming one of nonlinear type in general, in which the values of the parameters are optimized to guarantee stability. A family of nonlinear approximators to which the most common classes of feedforward neural networks belong are employed to accomplish the design via a convenient choice of their parameters (i.e., the weights), as shown by means of simulations with the optimal control of an unstable heat equation."
891231,14010,9078,Hyperspectral image superresolution: An edge-preserving convex formulation,2014,"Hyperspectral remote sensing images (HSIs) are characterized by having a low spatial resolution and a high spectral resolution, whereas multispectral images (MSIs) are characterized by low spectral and high spatial resolutions. These complementary characteristics have stimulated active research in the inference of images with high spatial and spectral resolutions from HSI-MSI pairs. In this paper, we formulate this data fusion problem as the minimization of a convex objective function containing two data-fitting terms and an edge-preserving regularizer. The data-fitting terms are quadratic and account for blur, different spatial resolutions, and additive noise; the regularizer, a form of vector Total Variation, promotes aligned discontinuities across the reconstructed hyperspectral bands. The optimization described above is rather hard, owing to its non-diagonalizable linear operators, to the non-quadratic and non-smooth nature of the regularizer, and to the very large size of the image to be inferred. We tackle these difficulties by tailoring the Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage Algorithm (SALSA) — an instance of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) — to this optimization problem. By using a convenient variable splitting and by exploiting the fact that HSIs generally “live” in a low-dimensional subspace, we obtain an effective algorithm that yields state-of-the-art results, as illustrated by experiments."
851188,14010,11104,Remote sensing of volcanic ash: Synergistic use of ash models and microwave observations of the erupting plumes,2013,"The goal of this work is to show potentials and drawbacks of Dual Polarization measurements of volcanic plume from microwave ground-based X-band radar (DPX). Measurements of brightness temperature (BT) from the space-orbiting microwave radiometer are used as well and compared with DPX retrievals of total columnar content (TCC). The latter is estimated from the radar variables using the volcanic ash radar retrieval for dual-polarization X band systems (VARR-PX) algorithm whereas BT's have been acquired from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS). Model simulations of volcanic plume evolution are generated to carry out comparisons with radar estimates of TCC. The Active Tracer High-Resolution Atmospheric Model (ATHAM) of eruption plume is used for this purpose. Results show that high- spatial-resolution DPX radar data identify an evident volcanic plume signature, even though the interpretation of the polarimetric variables and the related retrievals is not always easy, likely due to the possible formation of ash and ice particle aggregates, the radar signal depolarization induced by turbulence effects, and the partial filling of the radar beam. A forth degree polynomial relationship is in good agreement with BT - TCC measured samples with correlation of -0.71. The variability of TCC, described by the ATHAM simulations, seems to include the spatial and temporal variation of the radar retrievals."
499326,14010,9475,"DistFlow ODE: Modeling, analyzing and controlling long distribution feeder",2012,"We consider a linear feeder connecting multiple distributed loads and generators to the sub-station. Voltage is controlled directly at the sub-station, however, voltage down the line shifts up or down, in particular depending on if the feeder operates in the power export regime or power import regime. Starting from this finite element description of the feeder, assuming that the consumption/generation is distributed heterogeneously along the feeder, and following the asymptotic homogenization approach, we derive simple low-parametric ODE model of the feeder. We also explain how the homogeneous ODE modeling is generalized to account for other distributed effects, e.g. for inverter based and voltage dependent control of reactive power. The resulting system of the DistFlow-ODEs, relating homogenized voltage to flows of real and reactive power along the lines, admits computationally efficient analysis in terms of the minimal number of the feeder line “media” parameters, such as the ratio of the inductance-to-resistance densities. Exploring the space of the media and control parameters allows us to test and juxtapose different measures of the system performance, in particular expressed in terms of the voltage drop along the feeder, power import/export from the feeder line as the whole, power losses within the feeder, and critical (with respect to possible voltage collapse) length of the feeder. Our most surprising funding relates to performance of a feeder rich on PhotoVoltaic (PV) systems during a sunny day. We observe that if the feeder is sufficiently long the DistFlow-ODEs may have multiple stable solutions. The multiplicity may mean troubles for successful recovery of the feeder after a very short, few periods long, fault at the head of the line."
1068335,14010,9475,Nonlinear MPC of HIV-1 infection with periodic inputs,2011,"Although many papers address the issue of therapy design for HIV-1 infection based on control methods, the results available in the literature do not in general consider the fact that the manipulated variable is not continuous but a train of pulses. In addition, they are usually concerned only with the relation between drug effect (assumed to be manipulated) and virus dynamics. In order to improve the direct relation with actual clinical practice, the present work takes as manipulated variable a train of impulses that represent the pills taken by the patient and includes pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) drug models. In addition, patient adherence to treatment and their impact on virus drug resistance is also modeled. The problem of driving the viral load to a low specified value while minimizing the amount of drugs administered to the patient is thus addressed by nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with periodic inputs. Therefore, the paper contributions consist in the characterization of the results obtained with this type of control strategy in a HIV-1 infection model comprising drug PK and PD, development of virus resistance to drugs and virus dynamics. Furthermore, it is shown that various amounts of reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) and protease inhibitor (PI) drugs can be given depending on the weights of the cost function minimized by periodic NMPC, while attaining the same control objective. It is proposed that these weights can be adjusted to minimize the toxicity of the drug cocktail administered."
1162844,14010,9475,Mission planning in unstructured environments: A reinforcement learning approach,2011,"Mission planning scenarios in robotics typically involve one or more semi-autonomous agents and a human operator. The high-level goal is to find an optimal allocation of agents to tasks. Each individual task or collection of tasks may have subgoals, such as search, localization, or information gathering. Each of these lower-level goals are their own topics, and the high-level goal of task accomplishment can be categorized as a decision problem. The focus of this work is on solving decision problems through reinforcement learning. Tasks are completely parameterized by a minimal set of basis constraints—spatial, temporal, and (agent-task) coupling—which produces a single cost for each agent-task pairing. The cost completely captures the ability of a specific agent to perform a specific task. A novel state representation is presented that mitigates exponential growth of the state space by scaling independently of the spatial dimension. The decision problem is cast as an MDP and an optimal policy is found using Q-learning. Simulation results are presented for a two-agent two-task example, showing convergence of the value function and improved learning over time. To highlight the scalability of the learning algorithm, additional simulations compare the learned policy to a hand-coded greedy policy for varying number of tasks. The learned policy is shown to reliably allocate agents to tasks with minimal parameter tuning and is robust to low-level changes to agent dynamics as well as random agent motion."
1361815,14010,9475,Robust model-free formation control with prescribed performance and connectivity maintenance for nonlinear multi-agent systems,2014,"In this paper, we consider the formation control problem for a generic class of first-order nonlinear multi-agent systems, under an undirected communication model and connectivity constraints. More specifically, we design a decentralized model-free control protocol in the sense that each agent utilizes only local relative state information from its neighborhood set to calculate its own control signal, without incorporating any prior knowledge of the model nonlinearities/disturbances or any approximation structures to acquire such knowledge. Assuming that initially the graph is strongly connected, the proposed scheme guarantees that all initial communication links are maintained, that is all pairs of agents, initially forming an edge in the graph, remain within a distance representing the communication capabilities of the agents, preserving thus the strong connectiveness for all time. Additionally, the transient and steady state response is solely determined by certain designer-specified performance functions and is fully decoupled by the agents' dynamic model, the underlying graph topology and the control gains selection, which further relaxes the control design procedure. Finally, the proposed methodology results in a low complexity design. Actually, it is a static scheme involving very few and simple calculations to output the control signal, thus making its distributed implementation straightforward."
1438462,14010,11104,Applying microwave radiation response depth to validate soil moisture retrieved from AMSR-E data,2013,"Penetrability is one of the greatest advantages of microwave remote sensing over other remote sensing techniques. Estimating the sensing depth of passive microwave remote sensing is meaningful for simulation of satellite signals and validation of land surface parameters. In this paper, microwave radiation response depth (MRRD) was proposed to describe the thickness of the soil layer, within which variations in soil moisture can significantly affect the emitted radiation. Then, a statistical model for estimating MRRD was developed by regression analysis. This model can estimate the MRRD using four parameters, which are soil moisture, soil temperature, frequency, and soil specific surface area. For validation, a controlled field experiment was performed using a truck-mounted multi-frequency microwave radiometer (TMMR) at Baoding, Hebei province, China. The accuracy of the statistical model, in terms of root mean square error (rmse), was approximately 0.54 cm for the available experimental data at the frequency of 6.925, 10.65, and 18.7 GHz. Finally, the statistical model was applied into soil moisture validation. Taking the Global Land Data Assimilation Systems (GLDAS) product as the measurements, we validated the soil moisture retrieved from advanced microwave scanning radiometer-earth observing system (AMSR-E) data. The measured soil moisture obtained from an empirical depth and MRRD were both used to comparison. The rmse between soil moisture retrieved and measured is 0.060 and 0.047 cm 3 /cm 3  for empirical depth and MRRD based method, respectively. These results have shown that it is more reasonable to considered MRRD than an empirical depth in soil moisture validation."
1343585,14010,8441,Modeling and control of protein crystal shape distribution,2013,"The production of highly ordered, high quality protein crystals through batch crystallization processes is vital in devising proteins for therapeutic purposes in a number of diseases. Additionally, protein crystallization is a central activity in the pharmaceutical industry. The present work focuses on the modeling and control for a population of tetragonal hen egg-white (HEW) lysozyme protein crystals. First, a model is presented which will consider nucleation of lysozyme crystals followed by kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to model the crystal growth on the (110) and (101) faces, respectively. These kMC simulations comprise of adsorption, desorption, and migration events where the rate equations for each type of event are similar to those of Durbin and Feher [10]. The computation of the growth rate for each face requires the use of kMC simulations due to the dependence of the desorption and migration rates on the surface micro-configuration, and thus it cannot be computed simply by subtracting the adsorption and desorption rates. Next, the data obtained from the kMC simulations will be used to generate a nonlinear algebraic equation which relates the solute concentration and temperature to the growth rate ratio between the two independent crystal faces. A model predictive controller will use this nonlinear equation to regulate the protein crystals to desired shapes in the presence of disturbance in the operating conditions. The proposed method demonstrates that it can successfully achieve the desired crystal shapes which range from equidimensional to more elongated type of structures for the entire crystal population while in the presence of arbitrary variations in the solute concentration."
1082837,14010,11104,"Comparison of hyperion spectral unmixing endmembers to material spectral profiles from Oaxaca, Mexico",2012,"As part of a study of the ecology of the ancient Mesoamerican Zapotex state, endmember abundance maps of a large portion of the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, were generated using Hyperion imagery and a spatially adaptive spectral unmixing approach. However, the ecological diversity of Oaxaca makes it difficult to identify the materials the endmembers correspond to without ground-truth data. Therefore, during December 2011 ground-truth data and samples were collected from three different valleys in Oaxaca (Tlacolula, Yanhuitlan, and Yucuita). A total of 24 different soil and plant samples and one terra cotta tile sample were collected from these valleys. These samples include white caliche rocks and soil, grey basalt volcanic rocks, red iron-stained soils, yellow iron-stained soils, and several different senescent plant samples. The reflectance spectra of these samples were acquired through laboratory measurements using an Analytical Spectral Device FieldSpec Pro covering 400–2500nm. Concurrently to the laboratory measurements, endmember abundance maps were generated using a spatially-adaptive spectral unmixing algorithm and Hyperion hyperspectral imagery of the Tlacolula Valey. A comparison of the Hyperion endmembers to the laboratory sample reflectance measurements is performed to determine which of the Hyperion endmemberss result from a single type and which from a linear mixture of multiple materials. It is shown that of the eight derived endmembers, seven appear to be mixtures of multiple materials."
861381,14010,11104,Characterization of a satellite-based passive microwave sea ice concentration climate data record,2013,"A long-term, consistent, and reproducible satellite-based passive microwave sea ice concentration climate data record (CDR) is available for climate studies, monitoring, and model validation with an initial operation capability (IOC). The daily and monthly sea ice concentrations are on the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) polar stereographic grid with nominal 25 × 25 km grid cells in both the Southern and Northern Hemispheres from 09 July 1987 to 31 December 2007 with an update through 2012 underway. The NetCDF data files along with detailed data processing steps and error source information can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.7265/N5B56GN3. The dataset is archived by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) under the satellite climate data record program (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdr/operationalcdrs.html). The description and basic statistical characteristics of the CDR are presented here. Our analysis results have shown that while the Northern Hemisphere experiences diminishing sea ice extent for the two decades from January 1988 to December 2007 with a faster reduction rate for the annual minimum sea ice extent, the Southern Hemisphere has experienced slightly increase in its sea ice extent for the same period, especially for the annual maximum."
1039329,14010,11104,Lattice detection in persistent scatterer point clouds and oblique aerial imagery,2012,"Modern spaceborne SAR sensors like TerraSAR-X offer ground resolution of up to one meter in range and azimuth direction. Buildings, roads, bridges, and other man-made structures appear in such data often as regular patterns of strong and temporally stable points (Persistent Scatterer, PS). As one step in the process of unveiling what object structure actually causes the PS (i.e., physical nature) we present a two-dimensional production system which aggregates PS to lattices corresponding to the vertical and horizontal alignment of windows at multilevel building facades. Due to the similar oblique sensing geometry, facades are also visible in oblique aerial images with much higher resolution. Ideally advantages of both sensors can be combined (e.g., weather independence for SAR and high-resolution for optical images). The fusion of both sensors needs a high level of abstraction due to the different type of data. A common representation for facades are lattices which we extract in optical as well as in SAR data. The comparison show strong similarity and serve as a first step towards unveiling the physical nature of PS via lattice matching of data coming from different sensors. The biggest remaining obstacle is the transformation of the sensor's imaging geometry into a common coordinate system."
1479530,14010,9475,Approximate Dynamic Programming with (min; +) linear function approximation for Markov decision processes,2014,"Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a useful framework to study problems of optimal sequential decision making under uncertainty. Given any MDP the aim here is to find the optimal action selection mechanism i.e., the optimal policy. Typically, the optimal policy (u*) is obtained by substituting the optimal value-function (J*) in the Bellman equation. Alternatively, u* is also obtained by learning the optimal state-action value function Q* known as the Q value-function. However, it is difficult to compute the exact values of J* or Q* for MDPs with large number of states. Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) methods address this difficulty by computing lower dimensional approximations of J*/Q*. Most ADP methods employ linear function approximation (LFA), i.e., the approximate solution lies in a subspace spanned by a family of pre-selected basis functions. The approximation is obtained via a linear least squares projection of higher dimensional quantities and the L 2  norm plays an important role in convergence and error analysis. In this paper, we discuss ADP methods for MDPs based on LFAs in the (min; +) algebra. Here the approximate solution is a (min; +) linear combination of a set of basis functions whose span constitutes a subsemimodule. Approximation is obtained via a projection operator onto the subsemimodule which is different from linear least squares projection used in ADP methods based on conventional LFAs. MDPs are not (min; +) linear systems, nevertheless, we show that the monotonicity property of the projection operator helps us establish the convergence of our ADP schemes. We also discuss future directions in ADP methods for MDPs based on the (min; +) LFAs."

Although ground measurements, e.g., GNSS/InSAR and strong motion measurements, provide unique insights on the kinematic rupture and nature of the earthquake, but the temporal-spatial resolutions are still limited. In this paper, GNSS atmospheric seismology is proposed and a case study of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake is performed using ground GNSS measurements. Significant ionospheric disturbances are found at continuous GNSS sites near the epicenter with an intensive N-shape shock-acoustic wave propagating south-eastward, almost consisting with seismometer, indicating that the co-seismic ionospheric TEC disturbances were mainly derived from the main shock. Furthermore, the co-seismic tropospheric anomalies during the mainshock are also found, mainly in the zenith hydrostatic delay component (ZHD), which is supported by the same pattern of surface observed atmospheric pressure changes at co-located GNSS site that are driven by the ground-coupled air waves from ground vertical motion of seismic waves propagating. Therefore, the co-seismic atmospheric disturbances indicate again the acoustic coupling effect of the atmosphere and solid-Earth with air wave propagation from the ground to the top atmosphere."
1923641,14010,11104,Neural network estimation of atmospheric profiles using AIRS/AMSU observations: Improved uncertainty assessments,2011,"Neural networks are developed for estimating the rms accuracy profiles of individual infrared and microwave atmospheric temperature and humidity profile retrievals, thus potentially significantly improving their assimilation into numerical weather prediction models. Currently most assimilation processes compute retrieval variances or error-covariance matrices as ensemble averages over diverse profiles, or simply flag problematic retrievals. Although retrieval accuracies vary considerable from profile to profile because of clouds, even in cloud-free cases they can differ markedly. The ability to estimate accurately the variances of individual profiles is one of the benefits of hyperspectral infrared and microwave sounding. The variance-estimating neural network was trained to estimate the logarithm of variance, which was then mapped to standard deviation. Examples utilizing AIRS/AMSU/HSB soundings [1] on the NASA Aqua satellite and those from a proposed hyperspectral microwave sounder [2], [3] show that when the predicted rms errors for a single altitude are stratified, they agree with the actual rms errors within perhaps ten percent of the dynamic range of the stratifications thus significantly improving the potential for accurately weighting soundings against model parameters during assimilation. Simple quality indicators using the new variance estimates also favorably compare to AIRS Level 2 Version 5 quality flags."
2501932,14010,9475,Economic COP optimization of a heat pump with hierarchical model predictive control,2012,"A low-temperature heating system is studied in this paper. It consists of hydronic under-floor heating pipes and an air/ground source heat pump. The heat pump in such a setup is conventionally controlled only by feed-forwarding the ambient temperature. Having shown >10% cut-down on electricity bills by involving feedback control in a previous study, this paper has continued the same line of argument and has investigated effects of a priori knowledge on weather forecast and electricity price profile to alleviate the total electricity cost subject to constraints on resident's thermal comfort. A two level hierarchical control structure is chosen for this purpose. While local PI controllers at the bottom level maintain individual temperature set-points of the rooms, a model predictive controller at the top level minimizes water supply temperature, and hence maximizes the heat pump's coefficient of performance. At the same time, it determines the actual temperature set-points of the rooms by deviating from the user-defined set-points within a thermal tolerance zone. Simulations results confirm significant cut-down on electricity bills without sacrificing resident thermal comfort. The proposed control strategy is a leap forward towards balanced load control in Smart Grids where individual heat pumps in detached houses contribute to preserve load balance through intelligent electricity pricing policies."
1207677,14010,8441,LPV model identification for motion control systems,2013,"Motion systems for optical and manufacturing applications have demanding performance requirement in terms of speed and precision. Linear system description alone is often inadequate to meet the design and performance assessment requirements. Linear parameter varying (LPV) formulation is a promising approach to address system nonlinearity by using a family of linear time invariant (LTI) systems parameterized by the operating point. It is attractive as many aspects of the linear system theory, such as systems identification, parameter estimation, and feedback control, are still applicable, at least locally around each operating point. This paper addresses the issue of constructing a multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) LPV characterization based on local data around multiple operating points. The goal is to capture the large motion behavior by suitably interpolating the local LTI models. The identification of the LPV model parameters is posed as a nonlinear least square problem. An efficient iterative relaxation algorithm consisting of alternating least square problems is proposed for the solution. The proposed approach is applied to the simulation and experiment of a two-degree-of-freedom fast steering mirror (FSM). The LPV response matches well with the nonlinear system response for both small and large motion ranges, demonstrating the efficacy of the approach."
1805859,14010,11104,Earth limb calibration of scanning spaceborne microwave radiometers,2013,"We introduce a new technique for absolute “through-theantenna” calibration of cross-track-scanning passive microwave radiometers viewing earth from a low-earth orbit. This method offers significant advantages, in that neither internal calibration targets nor noise diodes are needed to calibrate the radiometer. The algorithm does require periodic updates of the atmospheric state, which can be readily provided by GPS radio occultation observations, for example. An iterative algorithm retrieves the radiometer gain given a sequence of observations of the earth's limb. The algorithm uses a parameterized radiative transfer model of a spherically-stratified atmosphere. The algorithm works best for opaque temperature sounding channels. This method, when used on idealized radiometer measurements (impulse response functions in frequency and space), yields calibration accuracies similar to those that could be obtained with ideal internal calibration targets. This analysis is based on global Monte Carlo simulations using the NOAA88b profile set. An analysis will also be presented showing how calibration performance degrades as the radiometer characteristics deviate from the ideal case. Among the factors considered are: 1) antenna pattern, 2) spectral passband, 3) pointing errors, 4) atmospheric state variability, 5) the number of limb observations required, and 6) sensitivity to sensor noise."
1204260,14010,9475,Voltage stabilization in microgrids via quadratic droop control,2013,"Motivated by the growing interest in energy technology and smart grid architectures, we consider the problem of voltage stability and reactive power balancing in low-voltage electrical networks equipped with DC/AC inverters (“microgrids”). It is generally believed that high-voltage equilibria of such networks are stable, but the locations of these equilibria are unknown, as is the critical network load where stability is lost. Inspired by the “control by interconnection” paradigm developed for port-Hamiltonian systems, we propose a novel droop-like inverter controller which is quadratic in the local voltage magnitude. Remarkably, under this controller the closed-loop network is again a well-posed electrical circuit. We find that the equilibria of the quadratic droop-controlled network are in exact correspondence with the solutions of a reduced power flow equation. For general network topologies, we study some simple yet insightful solutions of this equation, and for the frequently-encountered case of a parallel microgrid, we present a concise and closed-form condition for the existence of an exponentially stable high-voltage network equilibrium. Our condition establishes the existence of a critical inductive load for the network, which depends only on the network topology, admittances, and controller gains. We compare and contrast our design with the conventional droop controller, investigate the relationship between the two, and validate the robustness of our design through simulation."
1310926,14010,9475,Mean field games with partially observed major player and stochastic mean field,2014,"Mean field game (MFG) theory where there is a major player and many minor players (MM-MFG) has been recently introduced in both the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) case and in the case of nonlinear state dynamics and nonlinear cost functions. In this framework, a major player has a significant influence, i.e., asymptotically non-vanishing, on any minor agent. In contrast to the situation without major agents, the mean field term now becomes stochastic due to the stochastic evolution of the state of the major player and, as a result, the best response control actions of the minor agents depend on the state of the major agent as well as the stochastic mean field. In a decentralized environment, one is led to consider the situation where the agents are provided only with partial information on the major agent's state and the mean field term. In this work, we consider such a scenario for systems with nonlinear dynamics and cost functions and develop MFG theory for a partially observed MM-MFG setup. More explicitly, we consider a MFG problem with (i) partial observations on the major player state provided to the minor agents individually and (ii) complete observations on that state provided to the major player. The first step of such a theory requires one to develop an estimation theory for partially observed stochastic dynamical systems whose state equations are of McKean-Vlasov (MV) type stochastic differential equations. The next approach to the problem for MM-MFG systems in this work is to follow the procedure of constructing the associated completely observed system via the application of nonlinear filtering theory. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria is then analyzed in this setting."
2433240,14010,11104,A new physically based method for Air temperature downscaling,2011,"An international widespread concern about scaling is how to choose appropriate scale or resolution, and how to evaluate the impact of them[1]. Air temperature is an important input variable to estimate terrestrial evapotranspiration based on satellite remote sensing. The air temperature obtained by the observations from surface meteorological stations is limited in their spatial and temporal representation, while the validated GDAS (Global Data Assimilation System) has many advantages, it can provide the simulated temperature data every 3 hours, and it has great value in downscaling analysis. There are three major driving factors of the near surface air temperature: the surface long-wave radiative balance, land-air turbulent heat exchange, and advection. The fluctuation of the Air temperature (2m height level above ground) mainly depends on underlying surface feedback. Northern China was chosen as the study area. Using air temperature data from the GDAS forcing dataset as a data source, we proposed a new method for downscaling air temperature based on land surface temperature. In order to evaluate the performance of our methods, bilinear interpolation, spline interpolation were used in the comparison. To assess the performance of the downscaling approaches, the ground measurements were used to compare with the downscaling results. Experiments show that the effect of static feedback interpolation is the best based on the surface temperature. What we have got are as follows. First, In most plain areas, the air temperature(2m height level above ground) mainly depends on the temperature of the surface temperature. Second, during the process of downscaling, pure mathematic methods appear to be not sufficient. It is necessary that the effects of physical basis be taken into consideration."
1518663,14010,8441,Visual control for trajectory tracking of Quadrotors and real-time analysis on an emulated environment,2013,"Quadrotor are non-inertial systems with inherent nonlinear, very fast and very unstable dynamics where measurements of their state variables in an absolute frame of reference are very complex in GPS denied environments, such as indoors. In order to design control strategies for Quadrotors, we solve problems of imprecisely known models and noisily, or unavailable, position and speed measurements, and requirements of a safety test-bench for the first stages of design. In this paper, we face the problem of control of a Quadrotor using visual information and of a safe virtual Real-Time test of the controlled system. The contribution is twofold; first we present a model-free control law for tracking non-inertial robots, using as a case of study a Quadrotor, and we propose a Real-Time analysis of the dynamical behavior of the closed-loop system based on experimental data obtained using an emulation-based implementation architecture where the environment is a numerical emulation of the real one. The control of attitude and position are designed based on a Second Order Sliding Mode and PD like approaches, respectively, and the feedback state is obtained visually using an easy to program and portable Particle Filter for positions and a Second Order Differentiator for time derivatives. We describe the numerical simulation test bench and include some results obtained in Real- Time on an emulated environment."
2981601,14010,9475,Analysis farm: A cloud-based scalable aggregation and query platform for network log analysis,2011,"Network monitoring data provides insights into the network operation status. With increasingly sophisticated ways of probing, sampling and recording network activities, the huge amount of monitoring data brings both an opportunity and a challenge for network data analysis. We aim to build a scalable platform, named Analysis Farm, for analyzing network logs. Analysis Farm's targets include fast log aggregation and agile log query. To achieve these goals, storage scalability, computation scalability and query agility should be addressed. The cloud computing and NoSQL technologies meet our needs by providing manageable on-demand hardware resources and novel data storage models. We choose OpenStack, an open-source cloud tool set, for resource provisioning, and MongoDB, a RDBMS-like document-oriented NoSQL system, for log storage and analysis. By combining scalability at both OpenStack and MongoDB, we build Analysis Farm capable of storage scale-out, computation scale-out and agile query. The Analysis Farm prototype in use, consisting of 10 MongoDB servers, aggregates about 3 million log records in a 10-minute interval and handle ad hoc query effectively in the log database accumulated with more than 400 million records per day. In this paper, we describe Analysis Farm's background, targets, architecture and some experimental results. We believe Analysis Farm will benefit those who work on big-log-style data analysis."
1006623,14010,8441,Networked model predictive control of spatially distributed processes,2013,"This work focuses on networked model predictive control (MPC) of spatially distributed processes modeled by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with sensor measurements that are transmitted to the controller over a resource-constrained communication medium. The objective of our work is to enforce the desired stability properties with minimal sensor-controller information exchange. To this end, a Lyapunov-based MPC is designed on the basis of a Lyapunov-based analytical bounded controller which is used to characterize the stability region of the predictive controller and also provide a feasible initial guess to the optimization problem in the predictive controller formulation. Unlike conventional Lyapunov-based MPC formulations, the sensors do not have to transmit the measurements at a fixed rate; instead an adaptive communication strategy is applied to switch on or off the communication over the network. The key idea is to monitor the model estimation error at each sampling time and suspend communication for periods when the prescribed stability conditions obtained based on the forecasted evolution of the Lyapunov function are satisfied. When the model estimation error grows and fails to satisfy the stability conditions, which indicates the possible loss of stability in the future, the sensors are prompted to send their measurements and the model estimation error is reset to zero in order to ensure closed-loop stability. Finally, the implementation of the results is illustrated using a representative diffusion-reaction process example."
2547910,14010,11104,Estimation of evapotranspiration based on remote sensing in Heihe River Basin,2011,"Regional evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component in water cycle and energy balance. The research on regional evapotranspiration is very important to further our understanding of the global climate change, land surface atmosphere interaction, water cycle and ecological study. However, traditional site observation is only representative of the local site scale, which can not reflect the real regional conditions. Remote sensing provides a promising way to retrieve regional evapotranspiration. Heihe River Basin is the second largest inland river basin in northwest of China, water shortage has become a crucial problem to regional ecological, environmental, economic and other related areas. The research on regional evapotranspiration is in an urgent need in this area. SEBS model, a physically based model, was selected to retrieve regional evapotranspiration. Combined with MODIS products and site observations, evapotranspiration in typical days were estimated with SEBS model. The instantaneous results were validated with flux observation data from Yingke station. In most days SEBS model have good estimation of surface fluxes, the difference between observations and estimation is limited in 50W/m 2 . For longer time ET estimation, reference evapotranspiration fraction was selected to scale instantaneous measurements to daily and motherly evapotranspiration. Adjusted pan observations were used to validate the scaled daily results, the results indicate reference evapotranspiration fraction based method have good quality to scale daily ET. Moreover, clear spatial patterns of ET were found in Heihe River Basin. This spatial pattern is closely correlated with land use/land cover and water uses in Heihe River Basin."
1054802,14010,9475,Information weighted consensus,2012,"Consensus-based distributed estimation schemes are becoming increasingly popular in sensor networks due to their scalability and fault tolerance capabilities. In a consensus-based state estimation framework, multiple neighboring nodes iteratively communicate with each other, exchanging their own local estimates of a target's state with the goal of converging to a single state estimate over the entire network. However, the state estimation problem becomes challenging when a node has limited observability of the state. In addition, the consensus estimate is sub-optimal when the cross-covariances between the individual state estimates across different nodes are not incorporated in the distributed estimation framework. The cross-covariance is usually neglected because the computational and bandwidth requirements for its computation grow exponentially with the number of nodes. These limitations can be overcome by noting that, as the state estimates at different nodes converge, the information at each node becomes redundant. This fact can be utilized to compute the optimal estimate by proper weighting of the prior state and measurement information. Motivated by this idea, we propose information-weighted consensus algorithms for distributed maximum a posteriori parameter estimates, and their extension to the information-weighted consensus filter (ICF) for state estimation. We show both theoretically and experimentally that the proposed methods asymptotically approach the optimal centralized performance. Simulation results show that ICF is robust even when the optimality conditions are not met and has low communication requirements."
2040327,14010,11104,Improved estimation of aerosol optical depth from Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery over land,2011,"The radiation from the sun to satellites in the sky is always modulated twice by atmosphere. Aerosol is one of the most active components in atmosphere and it usually contaminates the remotely sensed imagery severely so that most remotely sensed imagery cannot be used without atmospheric effect correction. However, the remotely sensed imagery is always the coupling of atmosphere and land surface information, which makes it very difficult to decouple the remotely sensed information to retrieve accurate atmospheric information and land surface information respectively from remotely sensed imagery alone. Based on the physical mechanism of radiative transfer model, many researchers assumed the specific surface condition, such as dark objects and invariant objects, so the atmospheric information like aerosol optical depth (AOD) can be decoupled from remotely sensed information. Since these assumptions are just for some specific surface conditions, the atmospheric information of many other surface conditions, such as sparsely vegetated areas and snow covered areas, are not available. In this study, we develop a new aerosol estimation algorithm that can effectively estimate the spatial distribution of atmospheric aerosols from TM/ETM+ imagery under general atmosphere and surface conditions. The estimated aerosol optical depth from this algorithm is validated by Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements. The case study in Beijing, China indicates that this algorithm can retrieve aerosol optical depths from TM/ETM+ imagery reasonably well. Moreover, this algorithm has the potential to be applied to some new satellite images with moderate to high spatial resolution, such as Huan Jing (HJ) and China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) series of China."
1068608,14010,9475,Viability and analysis of implementing only voltage-power droop for parallel inverter systems,2014,"In microgrids that are predominantly resistive, real and reactive power can be controlled by implementation of voltage and frequency droop laws respectively. However, the variable frequency displayed by such a system complicates analysis such that design approaches rely on approximations and linearized models. In this work, we present a modified form of droop control where only the voltage versus real power relationship is upheld and the frequency is held constant. Since the frequency is not explicitly controlled and the reactive power is not measured, the controller can be simplified. In such a setting, the only assumption we make is that all inverters have access to a common time-reference. Because fixed frequency operation is enforced by design, a variety of analytical tools can be leveraged to formulate a comprehensive analytical framework which facilitates a precise design methodology. In particular, closed-form expressions on the output current phase differences are obtained which yield practical selection guidelines on the voltage-power droop gains such that reactive flows between inverters are kept small. As a corollary, it is demonstrated that there are no reactive power flows in the presence of purely resistive loads. For the particular case of a single inverter, an almost exact solution describing the nonlinear dynamics of the inverter output voltage, current, and power are derived. Accompanying simulation results validate the analytical results and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control approach."
2052839,14010,11104,Daily estimates of the tropospheric aerosol optical thickness over land surface from MSG geostationary observation,2011,"This paper presents an innovative method to estimate the daily aerosol optical thickness (AOT) on a continental scale, using MSG observation. The approach takes best benefit of the high temporal resolution of the observing system, in order to disentangle the surface and aerosol angular signatures. For such, a semi-empirical BRDF model that mimics both surface and aerosols signals is inverted according to a recursive scheme. The method is not instrument-specific and could be reproduced with other GEO and LEO observing systems. Herein, field of application is restricted to MSG/SEVIRI data over midlatitude and African regions. The reliability of AOT estimates is demonstrated through comparisons with local AERONET ground measurements and at regional scale against MODIS. The method appears very promising for tracking anthropogenic emissions in the troposphere and also for estimating dust events over bright surfaces. Furthermore, high temporal AOT retrievals at moderate spatial resolution stress the effects of the density of urbanization and potentially on motor vehicle traffic on air quality. Finally, this study suggests that this approach is appropriate for multi-sensor data fusion, for the simultaneous retrieval of surface albedo and AOT, and also to generate these products in near-real time with a very high generation frequency."
786603,14010,9475,Optical flow sensing and the inverse perception problem for flying bats,2013,"The movements of birds, bats, and other flying species are governed by complex sensorimotor systems that allow the animals to react to stationary environmental features as well as to wind disturbances, other animals in nearby airspace, and a wide variety of unexpected challenges. The paper and talk will describe research that analyzes the three-dimensional trajectories of bats flying in a habitat in Texas. The trajectories are computed with stereoscopic methods using data from synchronous thermal videos that were recorded with high temporal and spatial resolution from three viewpoints. Following our previously reported work, we examine the possibility that bat trajectories in this habitat are governed by optical flow sensing that interpolates periodic distance measurements from echolocation. Using an idealized geometry of bat eyes, we introduce the concept of time-to-transit, and recall some research that suggests that this quantity is computed by the animals' visual cortex. Several steering control laws based on time-to-transit are proposed for an idealized flight model, and it is shown that these can be used to replicate the observed flight of what we identify as typical bats. Although the vision-based motion control laws we propose and the protocols for switching between them are quite simple, some of the trajectories that have been synthesized are qualitatively bat-like. Examination of the control protocols that generate these trajectories suggests that bat motions are governed both by their reactions to a subset of key feature points as well by their memories of where these feature points are located."
1456948,14010,9475,Detection of loading effects in bacterial stress response using biochemical stochasticity,2014,"Bacteria have the ability to sense environmental stress signals and translate them into the appropriate response necessary for survival. One recurring mechanism used for this are two-component systems composed of membrane-bound sensory proteins and response regulator proteins. The regulator proteins are transcription factors that activate a set of genes necessary to trigger the global response leading to phenotypic switching. Measuring the activity of these regulators is essential to the understanding of the stress response and is typically done through the insertion of non-native fluorescent reporter proteins. Introduction of these reporters inside the cell can cause loading as they interfere with the native cell response and regulator activity. In this paper we use mathematical modeling and analysis of a typical response mechanism to show how loading can bias the measurements and cause misidentification of important characteristics of the stress-induced response, such as its qualitative nature and the thresholds that cause phenotypic switching.We establish an approach for determining the presence of loading effects using single cell measurements and biochemical stochasticity of the reporter mechanism. The fluorescence measurements of the loaded system are shown to have different noise characteristics compared to unloaded systems, with larger loads creating more significant differences. The approach depends only on knowing the structural properties of the response model and the load, and it does not rely on the identification of model parameter values."

The research has been done within ongoing ESA-PECS and National Research Project (No N N526 160040) realized in the Institute of Geodesy and Cartography, Remote Sensing Department in Warsaw. CO 2  flux measurements were performed with a static chamber method from April till September from 2010 - 2012. For each of the classified wetlands vegetation habitats the relationship between soil moisture and backscattering coefficient has been examined and the best combination of microwave variables ENVISAT ASAR (wave length, incidence angle, polarization) has been used for mapping and monitoring of soil moisture. Carbon input to an ecosystem occurs through the process of photosynthesis. The rate of photosynthesis (CO 2  uptake) is referred to as gross primary production (GPP). CO 2  is in turn released to the atmosphere through respiration. The difference between GPP and R eco  is referred to as net ecosystem exchange (NEE). By estimating the direction of NEE, it is possible to determine whether a surface is a likely source or a sink of carbon. The NEE has been related to biomass and soil moisture which was also related to the ratio of NDVI and Ts from NOAA/AVHRR."
1498136,14010,9475,A fast method for solving guard set intersection in nonlinear hybrid reachability,2013,"Reachability computation formulates the problem of simulating the behavior of a continuous or hybrid dynamical system in a set-theoretical framework. Compared to the stochastic approach, it provides guaranteed results and has been shown highly valuable for verification or synthesis tasks. This issue is still quite challenging for uncertain nonlinear hybrid dynamical systems.Recently, [1] proposed a method for solving the flow/guard intersection problem that is at the core of hybrid reachability. It first derives an analytical expression for the boundaries of continuous flows using interval Taylor methods and techniques for controlling the wrapping effect. It then expresses the event detection and localization problem underlying flow/guard intersection as a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP). One of the main issues in interval integration is to control, at each step, the overestimation of the reachable state set due to the wrapping effect. For this purpose, [1] only relies on the geometrical transformation induced by Lohner's QR-factorization method [4], which acts at the integration step. But when dealing with hybrid systems, another source of overestimation exists at the transition step. This paper describes an efficient method for solving flow/guard intersection: using the standard contractor HC4Revise at the transitions step, we will show how to minimize both the overestimation of the flow/guard intersection and the computational complexity, hence computation time. Interestingly, the geometrical transformation introduced by Lohner's QR-factorization method combined with our method, eventually minimizes the overestimation for the whole hybrid flow trajectory. The performance of the new method is illustrated on examples involving typical hybrid systems."
1067434,14010,11104,Multisensor data fusion and feature extraction for forestry applications,2012,"In this paper we discuss feature level multisensor data fusion with P-, L-, and C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data and multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. The application is classification of Maritime pine age classes and bare ground in the Nezer forest in France. Multisensor data fusion is motivated by the complementary information available in SAR and optical data. Our objective is to investigate the choice of features among twenty six well known descriptors. First, we demonstrate the benefit of multisensor data fusion for improved classification performance over single sensor data classification with respect to forest monitoring. A comparison of the classification performances among the four different datasets reveals that the P-band SAR features yield the best results. By combining the P-band SAR features with the multispectral optical features, a significant classification accuracy improvement of 12.6% is achieved. Second, all twenty six features extracted in total from the four datasets are investigated for the purpose of identifying those features jointly possessing the highest discrimination power. Five features are found to preserve 98.5%of the classification information compared to classification based on the total set of features. This shows the advantage of feature selection with respect to preserving classification information while at the same time reducing the dimensionality of the feature space. A potential for improving the classification performance is also found by applying a thorough feature selection procedure."
715290,14010,9475,A max-plus based randomized algorithm for solving a class of HJB PDEs,2014,"McEneaney introduced the curse of dimensionality free method for the special class of infinite horizon optimal control problems where the Hamiltonian is represented as a maximum of quadratic affine functions. This method is featured by its cubic complexity with respect to the state space dimension, but the number of basis functions is multiplied by the number of switches at each iteration, referred to as the ‘curse of complexity’. In previous works, an SDP-based pruning technique was incorporated into the method in order to reduce the curse of complexity. Its efficiency was proved on many examples. In this paper we develop a new max-plus based randomized algorithm to solve the same class of infinite horizon optimal control problems. The major difference between the new algorithm and the previous SDP-based curse of dimensionality free method is that, instead of adding a large number of functions and then pruning the less useful ones, the new algorithm finds in cheap computation time (linear in the current number of basis functions), by a randomized procedure, useful quadratic functions and adds only those functions to the set of basis functions. Experimental results show that the max-plus randomized algorithm can reach the same precision order obtained by the SDP-based method with a speedup varying from 10 up to 100 and that the maximal precision order attainable by the new algorithm is much better than what can be done by the SDP-based algorithm in reasonable computation time. Besides, with the randomized algorithm we are now able to tackle switched problems with more number of switches, which will allow us to extend the algorithm to more general classes of optimal control problems."
1934461,14010,11104,A multiple instance learning approach for landmine detection using Ground Penetrating Radar,2011,"The Edge Histogram Detector (EHD) is a well-researched and tested algorithm that has been integrated into fielded systems for landmine detection using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) sensor. It uses edge histogram based features and a possibilistic K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. Due to the inherent static data representation and static classifier architecture, the EHD may not be very effective in detecting targets with large variations in shape and size. In this paper, we propose a more flexible approach that is based on multiple instance learning. First, we summarize the training data and identify representative mine alarms. This summarization step could be achieved using one or multiple feature representation to capture different characteristics of the data. The identified prototypes, also called bags of mines, will be used to map the alarms to a feature space that improves the discrimination between mines and clutter objects. The second step of our approach consists of building a classifier on the mapped feature space. We experiment with two different classifiers. The first one is a simple linear classifier that compares the features in the mapped space. The second classifier is based on learning Relevance Vector Machines (RVM) in the sparse mapped space. Our initial experiments on large and diverse Ground Penetrating Radar data collections show that the proposed approach can outperform the baseline EHD."
1666540,14010,9475,Bifurcation analysis points towards the source of beta neuronal oscillations in Parkinson's disease,2011,"Parkinson disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer, affecting 0.16% of the population in the USA 1 . This disease is most common in the elderly, what makes it a prominent health problem in developed countries, where the elder population is expected to importantly increase in the future. The mechanism generating the disease is the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), a small brain region from the brain stem. These neurons release the neurotransmitter dopamine to the basal ganglia, a large and complex brain structure implicated in motor control and reinforcement learning. Once SNc neurons have died, the basal ganglia starts showing prominent features of malfunction, and the characteristics symptoms of Parkinson's disease began to be observed in the patient (i.e. general difficulty or inability to execute motor movements and limb tremor, among others). Modern theory of Parkinson's disease focuses on the abnormal brain activity oscillations observed in the basal ganglia, which are consistently observed in parkinsonian patients and correlate with their symptoms. This paper develops a mathematical model of the basal ganglia, which reproduces the experimentally recorded neuronal activity of this brain structure in health and disease. Studying this model numerical and analytically, we draw conclusion on how and where these oscillations are generated within the brain. If the conclusions of this mathematical model are further confirmed experimentally, we think they pave the way towards controlling such oscillations pharmacologically or through electrode stimulation in the future."
1339967,14010,11104,Comparison of stereo-optical and dual-band InSAR DEMs in Papua New Guinea,2012,"This paper describes comparison of digital elevation data derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and stereo optical imagery used to understand temporal changes of tropical forest and to estimate tree height in tropical regions. Tree height information is important for forest management and global carbon cycle studies. An intereferometric SAR (InSAR) potentially unhampered by tropical cloud cover. InSAR heights depend on the microwave frequency: low frequency P-band penetrates to the forest floor and ground-volume scattering yields a height close to terrain height, high frequency X-band displays only shallow canopy penetration, and may yield heights several metres below the canopy surface. The exact behaviours depend on the nature of both terrain and forest. A stereo-optical sensor may be used to derive digital elevation data using photogrammetry. Several recent satellite-based stereo-optical instruments operate with fine spatial resolution however optical imagery is affected by clouds. The forest height derived from optical images is essentially the top of the canopy. This research investigates whether it is possible to understand forest changes in tropical regions by comparing digital elevations from dual-frequency, single-pass airborne InSAR with satellite-based stereo-optical data in Papua New Guinea. The results indicate the possibility of forest change and tree height estimation using this combination of data."
1391263,14010,8441,Regulation of a controlled Burgers' equation: Tracking and disturbance rejection for general time dependent signals,2013,"In this paper we describe a significant extension of our earlier work on design of feedback laws for regulation of nonlinear distributed parameter systems. In our previous work we presented a technique that was primarily applicable for set-point control. This method was based on the geometric theory of output regulation. In this paper we show that a generalization, motivated by the same theory, can be derived to design feedback laws for solving regulation problems for very general time dependent reference and disturbance signals. In this work the usual assumptions used in the geometric theory do not strictly apply, but nevertheless, we show that some analogs of the regulator equations from the geometric theory can be derived and used to obtain accurate approximations of the control inputs. We note that this methodology is not a simple extension of the set point tracking problem. In particular the infinite dimensional controller involves the solution of a singular DAE. An important part of this work is the development of an iterative regularization scheme that is used to obtain a sequence of time dependent control laws which provide an approximate solution of the regulation problem. Rather than attempt to address the general abstract theory, we demonstrate the method for a multi-input multi-output regulation problem which involves a tracking/disturbance rejection problem for a nonlinear distributed parameter system governed by a one dimensional viscous Burgers' equation. This work represents a significant advance over our earlier work, allowing tracking and disturbance rejection for very general time dependent signals."
976690,14010,9475,Dynamics in network games with local coordination and global congestion effects,2014,"Several strategic interactions over social networks display both negative and positive externalities at the same time. E.g., participation to a social media website with limited resources is more appealing the more of your friends participate, while a large total number of participants may slow down the website (because of congestion effects) thus making it less appealing. Similarly, while there are often incentives to choose the same telephone company as the friends and relatives with whom you interact the most frequently, concentration of the market share in the hands of a single firm typically leads to higher costs because of the lack of competition. In this work, we study evolutionary dynamics in network games where the payoff of each player is influenced both by the actions of her neighbors in the network, and by the aggregate of the actions of all the players in the network. In particular, we consider cases where the payoff increases in the number of neighbors who choose the same action (local coordination effect) and decreases in the total number of players choosing the same action (global congestion effect). We study noisy best-response dynamics in networks which are the union of two complete graphs, and prove that the asymptotic behavior of the invariant probability distribution is characterized by two phase transitions with respect to a parameter measuring the relative strength of the local coordination with respect to the global congestion effects. Extensions to random networks with strong community structure are studied through simulations."
1156667,14010,9475,Compensation of state-dependent input delay for nonlinear systems,2011,"We introduce and solve stabilization problems for linear and nonlinear systems with state-dependent input delay. Since the state dependence of the delay makes the prediction horizon dependent on the future value of the state, which means that it is impossible to know a priori how far in the future the prediction is needed, the key design challenge is how to determine the predictor state. We resolve this challenge and establish closed-loop stability of the resulting infinite-dimensional nonlinear system for general non-negative-valued delay functions of the state. Due to an inherent limitation on the allowable delay rate in stabilization of systems with time-varying input delays, in the case of state-dependent delay, where the delay rate becomes dependent on the gradient of the delay function and on the state and control input, only regional stability results are achievable. For forward-complete systems, we establish an estimate of the region of attraction in the state space of the infinite-dimensional closed-loop nonlinear system and for linear systems we prove exponential stability. Global stability is established under a restrictive Lyapunov-like condition, which has to be a priori verified, that the delay rate be bounded by unity, irrespective of the values of the state and input. We also establish local asymptotic stability for locally stabilizable systems in the absence of the delay. Several illustrative examples are provided, including unicycle stabilization subject to input delay that grows with the distance from the reference position."
938471,14010,11104,"A winter monsoon front over the South China Sea studied by multi-sensor satellite data, weather radar data, and a numerical model",2012,"An atmospheric frontal system over the South China Sea (SCS) arising from the replenishment of the northeast monsoon is investigated by using multi-sensor satellite data, weather radar data, and a numerical model. The replenishment or freshening of the northeast monsoon results from the merging of two high pressure areas over the Chinese Continent. The near-sea surface wind field associated with this event was measured by the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) onboard the European MetOp satellite and the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) onboard the European Envisat satellite. The high resolution ASAR image reveals that the frontal line separating this wind field from the synoptic-scale ambient wind field is as sharp as in the case of a cold air outbreak and contains embedded rain cells. Furthermore, it shows that this replenishment was associated with northeasterly winds with speeds of up to 13 ms −1  over the SCS at offshore distances larger than 60 km, but only with speeds of around 6 ms −1  near the coast. The comparison of the observational data with model results of the pre-operational version of the AIR (Atmospheric Integrated Rapid-cycle) forecast model of the Hong Kong Observatory shows that the AIR model can successfully simulate the time evolution of the frontal system and the wind field over the open ocean, but fails to simulate the wind field near the coast."
1791822,14010,11104,Land Surface Emissivity retrieval from the measurements of FengYun-2 satellites,2011,"This work addressed the Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) retrieval over west China region from combined Middle InfraRed (MIR) and Thermal InfraRed (TIR) data of the Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (SVISSR) aboard the Chinese first generation geostationary satellites FengYun-2C (FY-2C) and FengYun-2D (FY-2D). To improve the retrieval accuracy, the SVISSR/FY-2 infrared channels 1 (∼10.9µm), 2 (∼11.9µm), 4 (∼3.8µm) were intercalibrated with the well-calibrated AIRS/Aqua and MODIS/Terra channels in tropical regions using the Ray-Matching (RM) method and High Spectral Convolution (HSC) method. The atmospheric effects were removed from SVISSR/FY-2 data using MODTRAN fed with ECMWF (European Center for Median-range Weather Forecast) data. Based on the concept of Temperature Independent Spectral Indices of Emissivity (TISIE) constructed with one channel in MIR and the other in TIR, and assuming that the TISIEs do not change between day and night, the land surface emitted and reflected radiances in SVISSR/FY-2 MIR channel in a clear-sky daytime can be first separated, and then the directional reflectances at different angles were obtained. Finally, LSEs were modeled with the RossThick-LiSparse-R BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) model and the Kirchhoff's law."
1225017,14010,11104,Joint inversion of the 2011 Tohoku (Japan) earthquake from dinsar and GPS data,2012,"On March 11, 2011 a Mw 9.0 earthquake hit Honsu island in Japan. The so called “Tohoku-Oki” giant earthquake occurred near the northeast coast resulting from thrust faulting on or near the subduction zone plate boundary between the Pacific and North America plates. The rupture zone is roughly centered on the earthquake epicenter alongstrike, while peak slips were up-dip of the hypocenter, towards the Japan Trench axis. The rupture was also responsible of a big tsunami that struck a large portion of the coastal area of Tohoku-Oki region. Soon after the earthquake numerous space remote sensing sensors were tasked to acquire as much as possible information about the situation on ground. In particular, a large numbers of SAR images were collected from the ENVISAT and ERS-2 satellite. For this event, a group of researchers from the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV), named Tohoku-Oki INGV Team, decided to apply a multidisciplinary approach to carry on some analysis addressed to achieve added value outcomes. In this work we present part of the work done by the Team concerning DInSAR data analysis and the methodology to retrieve the seismic source of this extraordinary and disastrous event."
1327450,14010,9475,Optimizing robust limit cycles for legged locomotion on unknown terrain,2012,"While legged animals are adept at traversing rough landscapes, it remains a very challenging task for a legged robot to negotiate unknown terrain. Control systems for legged robots are plagued by dynamic constraints from underactuation, actuator power limits, and frictional ground contact; rather than relying purely on disturbance rejection, considerable advantage can be obtained by planning nominal trajectories which are more easily stabilized. In this paper, we present an approach for designing nominal periodic trajectories for legged robots that maximize a measure of robustness against uncertainty in the geometry of the terrain. We propose a direct collocation method which solves simultaneously for a nominal periodic control input, for many possible one-step solution trajectories (using ground profiles drawn from a distribution over terrain), and for the periodic solution to a jump Riccati equation which provides an expected infinite-horizon cost-to-go for each of these samples. We demonstrate that this trajectory optimization scheme can recover the known deadbeat open-loop control solution for the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) on unknown terrain. Moreover, we demonstrate that it generalizes to other models like the bipedal compass gait walker, resulting in a dramatic increase in the number of steps taken over moderate terrain when compared against a limit cycle optimized for efficiency only."
799455,14010,11104,Monitoring glacier surface velocity in West Kunlun Mountain using offset tracking methods based on ALOS/PALSAR images,2012,"The motion of mountain glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau is one of the key parameters in the research of environmental changes, especially the surface velocity variation over a period of years. Due to the abominable geographical conditions of steep terrain and freezing temperature, it is hard to acquire enough information using traditional ground survey. Optical remote sensing images could be useless during some special period with too much cloud cover. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of the alternative method-tracking offsets from SAR images, and is trying to add to the lacking information of glacier monitoring in west Kunlun Mountain. Three complete and detailed maps of glacier flow velocity fields during 2007–2010 are obtained by procedures of offset detection using cross correlation in Fourier domain. We found that winter glacier motions on the north slope are averagely 1 cm/day faster than south slope, well corresponding to the local topography. Accuracy of the results could be evaluated based on the offsets extracted from the regions obviously stationary, like the flat ground or the bed rock. The potential deviation is on the order of 0.12–0.25 pixels, which is acceptable in such large scale."
1177772,14010,11104,Satellite image fusion quality measurement by separating radiometric and geometric components,2012,"This paper focuses on quality assessment of fusion of multispectral (MS) images with high-resolution panchromatic (Pan) images. Since most existing quality assessments take the entire image into account simultaneously and generate some uncertainties, a novel and rather objective quality index has been proposed for image fusion. The index is comprised of geometric and radiometric parts. Both geometric and radiometric measurements are calculated using morphological algorithm applied on an edge image to create a mask which is used to separate high frequency regions from low frequency ones. The accuracy assessment is made using common existing criteria on geometric and radiometric segments and then a weighted sum is calculated to generate Radiometric and Geometric index (RG index). Several commonly used fusion algorithms such as IHS, modified IHS, PCA, Gram-Schmidt, Brovey Transform, Ehlers, High-Pass Modulation, Schowengerdt and UNB were applied on a very high resolution GeoEye and WorldView-2 images. In order to perform quality assessment, methods of Spectral Angle Mapper, Structural SIMilarity, Correlation Coefficients and Universal Quality Index for which the normalization were possible (for comparison purposes) were used. The utilized RG index showed that by separating spectral and spatial component quality measurement, the quality assessment is made on fused images in more distinct, explicit, accurate and objective manner."
2059758,14010,11104,Analysis of ALOS PALSAR and TerraSAR-X data for protected area mapping: A case of the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park-Uganda,2011,"The main purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of Quad-pol L-band ALOS PALSAR and Dual-pol X-band TerraSAR (TSX) data, as well as derived TSX image texture for land cover mapping. A per- pixel classification was performed using non-parametric decision tree method. Classifications involving the HH, VV and HH/VV TSX polarimetric band(s) resulted in kappa indices of 0.4326, 0.3577 and 0.4657 respectively. In contrast, classifications involving the HH, HV, VV, HH/HV, VV/HV, HH/VV, HH/HV/VV and HH/HV/VH/VV bands of ALOS PALSAR data resulted in corresponding kappa indices of 0.2972, 0.3395, 0.3269, 0.7141, 0.7058, 0.4697, 0.7311 and 0.7177. A further analysis was carried out using the image textures derived from the HH polarisation of TSX data. Three different categories of textures were analysed: SAR specific (SARTEX), textures based on grey level concurrence matrices (GLCM) and textures based on SAR image histogram (HISTEX). These resulted in kappa indices of 0.6740, 0.6655 and 0.7166 respectively. Moreover, a classification using two original TSX polarisations provided a kappa index of 0.4657. This showed an improvement in the classification accuracies by 45%, 43% and 52% respectively. On the basis of the resulting accuracies, it can be concluded that analysis of data with high polarisation increases the classification accuracy of land cover information derived from SAR data. Furthermore, inclusion of derived SAR textures in the classification process, provide a potential for improved land cover identification and mapping in the tropics."
801478,14010,8441,Design and control of phase-detection mode atomic force microscopy for cells precision contour reconstruction under different environments,2013,"Atomic force microscope (AFM) is equipped with height recognition with nano and sub-nano meter scale, and it can accurately build three-dimensional (3D) imaging of samples with micro-structure. In this paper, we propose a homemade phase-detection mode atomic force microscopy (PM-AFM). In measuring system, here we use a compact CD/DVD pick-up-head to measure the cantilever deflection. In scanning system, we use piezoelectric stages as the planar scanner. For the sake of accurately obtaining the contour of tender cells, first we design an MIMO adaptive double integral sliding mode controller (ADISMC) in xy-plane to increase the positioning accuracy and provide precision cell size. Second, in z-axis we design an adaptive complementary sliding-mode controller (ACSMC) to improve the scanning accuracy and to overcome the inconvenience for user with traditional proportional-integration controller. Besides, we use phase feedback signal, which features with higher sensitivity and faster response. Finally, the extensive experimental results are used to validate the performance of the proposed controller, quantify the scanning image quality of standard grating and reconstruct cells topography."
1339437,14010,9078,Radio-frequency interference separation and suppression from ultrawideband radar data via low-rank modeling,2014,"Radio-frequency interference (RFI) is the most common, and also the most challenging type of interference or noise source that has a direct impact on the performance of ultrawideband radar systems in various practical application settings. Existing techniques for RFI suppression either employ filtering (notching) which introduces other harmful side-effects such as side-lobe distortion and target-amplitude reduction or RFI modeling/estimation/tracking which requires complicated narrow-band modulation models or even direct RFI sniffing. In this paper, we propose a robust and adaptive technique for the separation and then suppression of RFI signals from ultra-wideband (UWB) radar data via modeling RFI as low-rank components in a joint optimization framework. More specifically, we advocate a joint sparse-and-low-rank recovery approach that simultaneously solves for (i) UWB radar signals as sparse representations with respect to a dictionary containing transmitted waveforms; and (ii) RFI signals as a low-rank structure. The proposed technique is completely adaptive with highly time-varying environments, and does not require any prior knowledge of the RFI sources (other than the low-rank assumption). Both simulated data and real-world data measured by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Ultra-Wideband (UWB) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) confirm that the proposed RFI separation/suppression technique successfully recovers UWB radar signals embedded in large-amplitude RFI signals."
852178,14010,11104,Land monitoring using GNSS-R techniques: A review of recent advances,2013,"Soil moisture is required to improve meteorological and climate predictions. Global soil moisture maps are nowadays produced daily from SMOS satellite data, with a basic spatial resolution of ~50 km. Recently, using data fusion techniques between SMOS and MODIS data, an operational service has been implemented at the SMOS-Barcelona Expert Center to downscale SMOS data down to 1 km over the Iberian peninsula [1]. However, despite SMOS operates in the passive microwave “protected” band from 1400 to 1427 MHz, radio frequency interference may degrade the quality of the soil moisture (and sea salinity) retrievals or even prevent them [2]. Signals of opportunity transmitted from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can be used for soil moisture, vegetation, snow, water level... monitoring after reflection (GNSS-R) on the Earth's surface. In principle, even though these signals can also be jammed, their structure and the way they are processed, makes them more robust in front of radio-frequency interference, while at the same time -in principle- can achieve also a better spatial resolution. In this work, the few different GNSS-R techniques are first revised, including their pros and cons. Then a few applications are revised, with special emphasis -but not exclusively- in those in which the UPC Remote Sensing Lab has been working."
1272204,14010,8441,LQR tracking of a delay differential equation model for the study of nanoparticle dosing strategies for cancer therapy,2013,"Currently, the most commonly used treatments for cancerous tumors (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.) have almost no method of monitoring the administration of the treatment for adverse effects in real time. Without any real time feedback or control, treatment becomes a “guess and check” method with no way of predicting the effects of the drugs based on the actual bioavailability to the patient's body. One particular drug may be effective for one patient, yet provide no benefit to another. Doctors and scientists do no routinely attempt to quantifiably explain this discrepancy. In this work, mathematical modeling and analysis techniques are joined together with experimentation to gain further insight into the challenges of nanoparticle delivery to tumor sites. There exists a commonly accepted model of drug clearance in the pharmacokinetics community, and it is demonstrated here that this model provides an accurate reflection of reality, as observed in experiment for delivery of gold-coated nanorods. This model is then utilized in a state space feedback control framework to regulate the nanoparticle concentration in the bloodstream. An equal time delay is also introduced in both the state and control input for the purpose of studying alternate dosing strategies. This study will aid in the prediction of the effects of the drugs in a patient's body, thus leading to better models for drug regimen and administration."
1805577,14010,20896,RoomZoner: occupancy-based room-level zoning of a centralized HVAC system,2013,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) combine low-power radios with embedded processors in order to provide high-resolution sensing and actuation over a geographic area. This revolution has begun to deliver a new generation of engineering systems and scientific breakthroughs. One area in which CPSs can have a significant impact is in energy conservation through the intelligent control of systems. In this paper we present a CPS that enables a centralized Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system to be retrofitted to enable room-level conditioning of a residence. This is a compelling application due to residential HVAC systems accounting for over 15% of all U.S. energy usage, making it one of the nation's largest energy consumers. Also, it has all the aspects of a complex CPS: it uses sensors to detect room occupancy and indoor climate, it actuates hardware, and it requires complex control algorithms in order to maximize energy savings without damaging the HVAC equipment or discomforting the occupants. With an implementation using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and a simple control algorithm we demonstrate an almost 15% energy saving in a residence over its existing centralized thermostat. With this demonstration, we pose a challenge to control theorists with the CPS community to refine our approach which could lead to even greater energy savings."
792427,14010,11104,Multi-level feature analysis for semantic category recognition,2013,"At half-meter resolution the earth's surface has roughly 600 Trillion pixels. The need to process satellite imagery at such enormous scales for automated semantic categorization and the requirement to repeat this process at time-stipulated intervals demand optimal strategies to scan, extract, and, represent image features for accurate land-cover detection. In this paper we focus on developing optimal strategies for semantic categorization of image data which often involves computationally intensive feature extraction and mapping processes. Our proposed semantic categorization framework involves feature extraction and mapping at multiple levels. Initially, we examine low-level pixel features such as edge gradients, orientations, and intensity values to compute feature vector based on aggregate statistics. At the second level we generate line based representation by connecting edge gradients to extract higher-order spatial features on image scenes that are screened by the first level. By employing a multi-level feature analysis strategy we develop a semantic categorization framework that is computationally efficient and accurate. We tested our approach for the automated detection of mobile home park scenes, a challenging land-cover class, using one-meter aerial image data. We report the detection performance of our system. We envision that such changes to traditional feature analysis are necessary for the massive image analysis challenges."
1632368,14010,11104,Importance of lithosphere-coversphere-atmosphere coupling to earthquake anomaly recognition,2012,"The GEOSS under construction is providing space-,aero-,ground/sea-based multiple observations on planet Earth for the seismogenic process monitoring and earthquake precaution. The stress enhancement and energy accumulation in seismic activity area change locally the physical parameters of lithosphere with the developing of a series of effects that can comprise most of the following ones: initial cracks, the fracturing of rockmass, the changing of electromagnetic properties, the decreasing of dielectric constant, the re-activation of P-holes, the leaking of pore-gas, and the rise of water-level. The physical states of coversphere and atmosphere are to be affected due to the lithosphere-coversphere-atmosphere (LCA) coupling, and the signals from the underground, surface, and atmosphere to satellites are to be changed with parameter anomaly. We suggested that the LCA coupling is important for understanding GEOSS observations, especially for earthquake anomaly recognition (EAR). Using deviation-time-space-thermal (DTS-T) method for EAR, three recent major earthquakes (2009 Italy L'Aquila earthquake, 2010 China Yushu earthquake and 2010–2011 New Zealand earthquake sequence) are taken as typical cases for analysis to the multi-parameters anomalies, preceding the shocking, with quasi-synchronism and geo-consistency. The specific LCA coupling effects related with the earthquakes are also discussed in brief."
1182682,14010,9475,Multivariable Multi-model-based magnetic control system for the current ramp-up phase in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX),2011,"By leveraging the availability of real time EFIT, we propose a robust, multi-model-based, multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) magnetic controller to provide current regulation, position stabilization, and shape control of the plasma during the current ramp-up phase in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX). During the ramp-up phase of the tokamak discharge, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium continually evolves. As a consequence, the plasma response model obtained via linearization around the changing MHD equilibrium evolves as well. A robust controller is designed to stabilize this family of plasma models, which are reformulated into a nominal model with uncertainty. The proposed controller is composed of three loops: the first loop is devoted to plasma current regulation, the second loop is dedicated to plasma radial and vertical position stabilization, and the third loop is used to control the plasma shape and X-point location. A singular value decomposition (SVD) of the nominal plasma model is carried out to decouple and identify the most relevant control channels. The DK-iteration method, combining H ∞  synthesis and μ analysis, is applied to synthesize a closed-loop controller that minimizes the tracking errors and optimizes input efforts. Computer simulations illustrate the performance of the robust, multi-model-based, shape controller, showing potential for improving the performance of present non-model-based controllers."
731053,14010,11104,Simulation of tsunami impact on Taiwan coastal area,2013,"The tsunami disaster triggered by a huge 9.0 magnitude earthquake strikes Japan on March 11th, 2011. It motivates us to get involved in a research work in tsunami topics of Taiwan and to simulate an impact of the tsunami on the coast of Taiwan. Tsunami propagation is often modeled by the shallow water equations. These equations are derived from conservation of mass and momentum equations. By adding friction slope to the conservation of momentum equations, it enables the system to simulate the propagation over the coastal area. This system is able to estimate inundation zone caused by the tsunami. By applying Neumann boundary condition and Hansen numerical filter, it brings more interesting complexities into this simulation system. The parallelizable two-step finite-difference MacCormack scheme is employed to simulate the tsunami. In this paper, the parallel implementation of the MacCormack scheme is proposed for the shallow water equations by using the modern graphics processing unit (GPU) which accommodates NVIDIA compute unified device architecture (CUDA) technology to speed up the computation of the assessment of tsunami inundation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is an effective simulation method for evaluating the impact on land inundation in Taiwan coastal area. With this method, we can in real-time manner monitor the progress of the land inundation. The information is valuable for constructing and refining the further altering systems in a dynamic manner for minimizing impacts caused by tsunamis."
1977891,14010,9475,Using economic Model Predictive Control to design sustainable policies for mitigating climate change,2012,"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is now an important and pressing matter. Systems control theory, and in particular feedback control, can contribute to the design of policies that achieve sustainable levels of emissions of CO 2  (and other greenhouse gases) while minimizing the impact on the economy, and at the same time explicitly addressing the high levels of uncertainty associated with predictions of future emissions. In this paper, preliminary results are described for an approach where economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) is applied to a Regional dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (RICE model) as a test bed to design savings rates and global carbon tax for greenhouse gas emissions. Using feedback control, the policies are updated on the basis of the observed emissions, rather than on the predicted level of emissions. The basic structure and principle of the RICE model is firstly introduced and some key equations are described. The idea of introducing feedback control is then explained and economic MPC is applied to design policies for CO 2  emissions. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for two different scenarios. Feedback control design provides a degree of robustness against disturbances and model uncertainties, which is illustrated through a simulation study with two particular types of uncertainties. The results obtained in this paper illustrate the strength of the proposed design approach and form the basis for future research on using systems control theory to design optimal sustainable policies."
1326829,14010,9475,Dynamic coupling between a human user and haptic virtual environment,2012,"In a teaching lab focused on embedded control, students create and interact with virtual environments using a haptic interface. Coupling physical (in particular physiological) environments to virtual environments gives rise to many interesting phenomena, one of which is the appearance of dissipativity in the coupled dynamics, the source of which is difficult to identify. Simple harmonic oscillators without damping exhibit damped behavior and diminished peak amplitudes when students excite them with their best manual approximations of step inputs. Motivated in part by our desire to develop teaching materials, we seek a simple human user model that describes the observed phenomena. We have found that a second order spring-mass-damper model describes the source impedance with which a human user is able to impose a position input on the haptic device, and that this impedance model can be incorporated into a model of the user's neuromotor intent by placing the spring as a series elastic element with a motion source. We use simple models to describe smooth inputs generated by the user's neuromotor system, and these are expressed as displacements of the motion source. We use the same haptic device to conduct system identification experiments using frequency domain techniques to estimate the driving point impedance of the human hand, and have recently incorporated these experiments into lab exercises."
2085912,14010,11104,Monitoring human activity with high resolution SAR and optical imagery - a synergistic approach,2013,"Illegal traffic by off-highway vehicles (OHV) damages the salt crusts of Salton Sea Playa (California, USA) which then impacts air pollution and advances ground erosion. To mitigate the environmental impact of these threads a traffic management plan has been implemented which includes the monitoring of vehicle related disturbances on the Playa. This pilot study assesses the feasibility whether the application of Coherence Change Detection (CCD) technique to very high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery can be used to identify and to quantify OHV traffic. While the impacts on the interferometric coherence are well described, e.g. by atmospheric effects and temporal decorrelation, a quantitative interpretation of the observed signatures in the context of surface changes is still not fully understood. As a consequence, the feasibility of using CCD as a sensitive tool to evaluate subtle surface changes is limited. In this paper we describe a ground truth experiment at Salton Sea Playa and the corresponding analysis of CCD results and high resolution optical image stacks, which have been acquired as a synergistic data source. Goal is to provide a methodical scheme of CCD signatures in relation to known ground disturbance. The recommendations from this pilot study will inform how spaceborne monitoring methodologies can be used in the playa traffic management strategy and how a potential monitoring service should be implemented."
2361170,14010,11104,Thematic mapping at regional scale using SIASGE Radar data at X and L band and optical images,2011,"This work aims to assess the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data combined with optical data to support local administrations in the knowledge of the land use and land cover at regional scale. In particular, the contribution of data available in the future through the SIASGE project, combining L-band and X-band radar imagery, is assessed in order to produce thematic maps. Moreover, the further contribution brought by C-band has been evaluated. The classification, focused on two regions in the north side of Italy, is driven by the legend of already existing maps tackling the real needs of the land managing authorities. As the combination of data from optical imagery is fundamental to achieve good thematic accuracy, the work has exploited the Support Vector Machine learning technique, which is more suitable than standard statistical parametric approaches in this respect. Concerning the classification step, some algorithmic issues has been faced to improve the results, such as training set selection strategy and data fusion techniques. The work has proved as the multi source data set (SAR and optical) is fairly suitable to produce thematic maps comparable to what already in use at local administrative level, allowing to obtain reliable maps with a classification accuracy in the order of 90 %."
1533753,14010,9475,Safe and efficient operation of centrifugal compressors using linearized MPC,2014,"Centrifugal compressors are widely used in many industrial applications such as natural gas extraction, refrigeration and gas transport. Since gas compression is both an energy and capital intensive process, it is very important to operate gas compressors in a safe and efficient manner in order to save resources and utilize their maximum capacity. This typically means to operate gas compression systems at working points that are close to surge, an unstable condition that can cause severe damage to the compressor and the associated piping system. Anti-surge control systems aim at preventing the compressor from going into surge due to planned operating condition changes and also due to unexpected external disturbances which can affect the system within a time window of hundreds of milliseconds. Anti-surge control is achieved by recycling or venting-off some of the compressed gas in order to increase the mass flow through the compressor and reduce the pressure ratio. Recently, also the use of electrical drives powering the compressor for enhancing surge avoidance has been proposed. Generally, anti-surge control can be stated as a nonlinear multivariable control problem with output constraints that also present very fast dynamics. In this paper, the potential benefits of an anti-surge controller based on linearized model predictive control (MPC) are discussed. The employed MPC algorithm has been implemented on an industrial controller to meet the real-time requirements and has been tested on a experimental compressor test rig. The control performance of a linearized MPC-based anti-surge controller is compared to that of a traditional anti-surge control approach with controlled discharge pressure and controlled distance to surge in the case of external disturbances."
1458966,14010,11104,Evaluation of MODIS and NCEP atmospheric products for land surface temperature retrieval from HJ-1B IRS thermal infrared data with ground measurements,2012,"In this paper, two atmospheric profile sources were assessed for land surface temperature retrieval purposes. One is the MODIS atmospheric profiles product (MOD07), and the other is the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational global analysis data. Atmospheric profiles were used as the input to the MODTRAN4 radiative transfer model to calculate atmospheric parameters involved in atmospheric correction with the aim of retrieving land surface temperature (LST) in the case of the TIR domain. The LST retrievals from the HJ-1B IRS data were compared with ground measured temperatures obtained from a series of field campaigns in Hebei province, China, from May to September 2010. Ground measurements were performed over four land cover types: bare soil, full-cover wheat, full-cover corn and water surface. Six days of measurements over the water surface and three days over land were collected. The results indicate that the LST derived from HJ-1B IRS data using the NCEP and MOD07 profiles both showed good agreement with the ground LSTs, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.19 and 1.51 K for NCEP and MOD07, respectively. The results presented in this paper show that the MODIS and NCEP atmospheric profiles are useful for accurate atmospheric correction in the TIR domain when local soundings are not available. In particular, the NCEP profile provides higher accuracy, whereas the MOD07 profile provides a higher spatial resolution."
1214319,14010,9475,Evaluation of the performance of indirect control of many DSRs using hardware-in-the-loop simulations,2012,"Controlling the power consumption of many Demand Side Resources, DSRs, will be required in the future power system where a big share of the electric energy will be produced using stochastic renewable sources and the conventional power plants might not have the flexibility of providing all the regulating power. Indirect control of demand side resources is supposed to shift the electric power consumption of each single unit through broadcasting of a control signal; the flexibility in the aggregated power consumption can be used for supplying balancing power to the electric power system. Indirect control approach is convenient from communication point of view since the real-time data flow is only in one direction because the decision is computed locally according to user preferences. On the other hand, this approach results in an open loop control scheme, since it is assumed that no real-time power readings from the units can be performed. The aim of the paper is to discuss the performance of an emulated closed loop control using an estimator for predicting the aggregate power response and a regulator. By using these components it is possible to produce a control signal to broadcast to distributed demand side resources. A population of DSRs, buildings with electric space heating, is indeed simulated in a software simulation platform using an hardware in the loop approach, that allows to feedback the real heat dynamics of SYSLAB FlexHouse into the simulations for pretending more realistic result."
1569384,14010,11104,Boundary regularization and building reconstruction based on terrestrial laser scanning data,2013,"Digitization and modeling of city buildings is always one of the most important issues in Virtual 3D City. Traditional methods are usually expensive and time-consuming. Nowadays reconstruction methods based on LiDAR (Light Detection And Range) data have been widely used [1] due to its powerful capacity of data acquisition. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data have got some promising results [2]. However the obvious disadvantage is that it can hardly get the profile information except for the roof of building, and the result is that people can not get complete building model. On the contrary, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) could get points cloud of buildings with high density and accuracy by multi-stations scanning for realistic 3D model reconstruction. The information includes not only building roofs, but also building profiles. In this paper, the authors use TLS data, and explore an automatic model reconstruction approach to establish digital building model. The registered cloud points from multiple scanning stations are taken as input parameters. Profiles information of building is extracted from raw points cloud by a segmentation algorithm. And a regular polyhedron model of building is finally presented. The experiment results show that the automatic reconstruction procedure and algorithms are easy to implement and can get reasonable building model after facade boundary regularization."
1242184,14010,9475,Unidirectional direct load control through smart plugs,2014,"Balancing energy demand and production is becoming a more and more challenging task for energy utilities also because of the larger penetration of renewable energies which are more difficult to predict and control. While the traditional solution is to dynamically adapt energy production to follow time-varying demand, a new trend is to drive demand itself. Most of the ongoing actions in this direction involve greedy energy consumers, like industrial plants, supermarkets or large buildings. Pervasive communication technologies may allow in the near future to push further the granularity of such approach, by having the energy utility interacting with residential appliances. In this paper we study large scale direct control of inelastic home appliances whose energy demand cannot be shaped, but simply deferred. Our solution does not suppose any particular intelligence at the appliances. The actuators are rather smart plugs—simple devices with local communication capabilities that can be inserted between appliances' plugs and power sockets and are able to interrupt/reactivate power flow through the plug. A simple control message can be broadcast to a large set of smart plugs for probabilistically enabling or deferring the activation requests of a specific load type in order to satisfy a probabilistic bound on the aggregated power consumption. The control law can be easily derived analytically."
1413876,14010,9475,A two-time-scale model-based combined magnetic and kinetic control system for advanced tokamak scenarios on DIII-D,2012,"System identification techniques have been successfully used to obtain linear dynamic plasma response models around a particular equilibrium in different tokamaks. This paper identifies a two-time-scale dynamic model of the rotational transform ι profile and β N  in response to the electric field due to induction as well as to heating and current drive (H&CD) systems based on experimental data from DIII-D. The control goal is to regulate the plasma ι profile and β N  around a particular target value. A singular value decomposition (SVD) of the plasma model at steady state is carried out to decouple the system and identify the most relevant control channels. A mixed sensitivity H ∞  control design problem is solved to determine a stabilizing feedback controller that minimizes the reference tracking error and rejects external disturbances with minimal control energy. The feedback controller is augmented with an anti-windup compensator, which keeps the given controller well-behaved in the presence of magnitude constraints in the actuators and leaves the nominal closed-loop unmodified when no saturation is present. Experimental results illustrate the performance of the proposed controller, which is one of the first profile controllers integrating magnetic and kinetic variables ever implemented in DIII-D."
1220509,14010,11104,The atmospheric processes associated with the tornadic super-outbreak of April 25 th through 28 th 2011 in relation to global change,2012,"A large and violent super-tornado outbreak occurred from April 25th – 28th, 2011, becoming the deadliest 24-hour outbreak in U.S history. According NOAA and the SPC, there were approximately 190 tornadoes reported with 320 deaths within the southern, mid-western and northeastern U.S. In the current study, Arctic sea ice loss affecting the North Atlantic Oscillation, a negative ENSO episode, Gulf of Mexico Sea Surface Temperatures (SST's) and an unusual shift of dry-line associated with parent mid-latitude cyclone (MCL) are potentially influenced by global change in association with the outbreak and studied using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, GFS modeling, NCEP/CPC CAMS & NOAA/ESRL/PSD NOAA/AOML/TCHP analysis, and stability parameters obtained from remote sensing. Larger implications state the Arctic sea ice lost reversed upper-level wind distribution and affected major wind systems such as the jet stream. Reduced albedo in the arctic increased solar insolation and shifted the temperature differential between latitudes, potentially perturbing Earth's feedback system."
1474435,14010,9475,Optimal control of manifold filling during VDE mode transitions,2013,"During mode transitions in advanced engines and powertrains, actuators (electronic throttle, fuel, spark timing, variable valve timing, etc.) need to be optimally coordinated to obtain the correct state for the next mode. Specific examples of mode changes include cylinder deactivation/reactivation transitions in variable displacement engines, combustion mode transitions in HCCI and DISI engines and clutch transitions between locked and unlocked states in dual clutch transmissions. Mode transitions lead naturally to optimal control problems that can be analyzed using the maximum principle and solved numerically. From this perspective, the paper considers in detail one of the simplest problems of its kind (which to the authors' knowledge has not been treated), the optimal control of intake manifold filling using the electronic throttle. This problem is relevant to variable displacement engines and to the fuel economy that these engines can achieve. The analysis of minimum time and Nonlinear Quadratic (NLQ) optimal control problems is presented for the nonlinear manifold filling dynamics based on the maximum principle and simulated optimal trajectories are reported. Then a recently proposed Iterative Model and Trajectory Refinement (IMTR) strategy for solving trajectory optimization problems is validated using the intake manifold pressure filling as a case study. Specifically, we demonstrate the convergence of IMTR to trajectories that are close enough to the trajectories obtained from the maximum principle."
1598212,14010,11104,A novel method for automatic clutter detection in radargrams acquired by orbiting radar sounders,2012,"Orbiting radar sounders are very important instruments that can probe the subsurface of planetary bodies from orbit. In particular, they produce vertical profiles revealing the geological structure of the subsurface. As a consequence of their nadir-looking acquisition geometry, radargrams may be affected by spurious off-nadir echoes due to surface clutter. These returns represent a relevant problem, as they may be detected as (or mask) actual subsurface targets. Clutter is usually detected by means of manual visual comparison between radargrams and surface clutter simulations obtained using available digital elevation models (DEM). This procedure is inherently subjective and time-consuming, thus leading to a possible reduction of the scientific return of the data. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a novel technique for the automatic detection of surface clutter returns in radar sounder data which can both greatly support the scientific community in manual analysis of radar sounder data and drive the development of reliable automatic methods. The proposed method is made up of three steps: i) simulation of surface clutter returns using available digital elevation models, ii) automatic coregistration between radargrams and simulations, and iii) extraction of surface clutter returns from the coregistered radargrams. The technique has been tested on two large datasets acquired on different areas of Mars by the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument. The results point out that the method is robust to radargram deformations (e.g., due to ionosphere effects) and that the coregistration process can achieve a very high accuracy."
746807,14010,9475,Stability margins in adaptive mixing control via a Lyapunov-based switching criterion,2012,"This paper proposes a Lyapunov-based switching logic within the framework of adaptive mixing control (AMC), where a weighted combination of a family of candidate controllers can be inserted in the loop to regulate the output of an uncertain plant. The proposed AMC scheme employs a bank of parallel estimators, or multiple estimators, together with a switching logic that orchestrates which estimate should be evaluated by the mixer. The switching logic is driven by input/output data and uses Lyapunov-based criteria to assess the best estimate among the bank of parallel estimates. The resulting scheme guarantees convergence of the switching signal in finite time to a controller that satisfies a Lyapunov inequality implying a prescribed stability margin. The problem of convergence to the desired controller is addressed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, most classes of continuous tuning adaptive control or switching adaptive control schemes do not guarantee that after the switching stops or the adaptation is switched off the resulting closed loop linear time-invariant (LTI) system is stable, unless there is sufficient plant excitation that guarantees convergence to the desired fixed parameter controller. The proposed scheme guarantees that if the desired controller is switched on, it will never be switched off thereafter. Furthermore, simulations demonstrate that while alternative adaptation methods can converge to an LTI unstable feedback loop, the proposed scheme consistently converges to the desired controller."
1960073,14010,11104,Applying spectral unmixing and support vector machine to airborne hyperspectral imagery for detecting giant reed,2011,"This study evaluated linear spectral unmixing (LSU), mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF) and support vector machine (SVM) techniques for detecting and mapping giant reed (Arundo donax L.), an invasive weed that presents a severe threat to agroecosystems and riparian areas throughout the southern United States and northern Mexico. Airborne hyperspectral imagery with 102 usable bands covering a spectral range of 475–845 nm was collected from a giant reed-infested site along the US-Mexican portion of the Rio Grande in 2009 and 2010. The imagery was transformed with minimum noise fraction (MFN) to reduce the spectral dimensionality and noise. The three classification techniques (LSU, MTMF and SVM) were applied to the transformed MNF imagery based 11 endmember spectra extracted from the images for each of the two years. Accuracy assessment and kappa analysis were performed to compare the differences in classification accuracies among the three classification methods. Results showed that SVM and MTMF performed better than LSU, with SVM being the best classifier in both years. The results from this study indicate that hyperspectral imagery in conjunction with image classification techniques is useful for distinguishing giant reed from associated plant species and for monitoring the progression of this invasive weed."
1029236,14010,9475,Nonparametric adaptive control using Gaussian Processes with online hyperparameter estimation,2013,"Many current model reference adaptive control methods employ parametric adaptive elements in which the number of parameters are fixed a-priori and the hyperparameters, such as the bandwidth, are pre-defined, often through expert judgment. Typical examples include the commonly used Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Networks (NNs) with pre-allocated centers. As an alternative to these methods, a nonparametric model using Gaussian Processes (GPs) was recently proposed. Using GPs, it was shown that it is possible to maintain constant coverage over the operating domain by adaptively selecting new kernel locations without any previous domain knowledge. However, even if kernel locations provide good coverage of the input domain, incorrect bandwidth selection can result in poor characterization of the model uncertainty, leading to poor performance. In this paper, we propose methods for learning hyperparameters online in GP-MRAC by optimizing a modified likelihood function. We prove the stability and convergence of our algorithm in closed loop. Finally, we evaluate our methods in simulation on an example of wing rock dynamics. Results show learning hyperparameters online robustly reduces the steady state modeling error and improves control smoothness over other MRAC schemes."
1852523,14010,9475,LPV model order selection in an LS-SVM setting,2013,"In parametric identification of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems, the scheduling dependencies of the model coefficients are commonly parameterized in terms of linear combinations of a-priori selected basis functions. Such functions need to be adequately chosen, e.g., on the basis of some first-principles or expert's knowledge of the system, in order to capture the unknown dependencies of the model coefficient functions on the scheduling variable and, at the same time, to achieve a low-variance of the model estimate by limiting the number of parameters to be identified. This problem together with the well-known model order selection problem (in terms of number of input lags, output lags and input delay of the model structure) in system identification can be interpreted as a trade-off between bias and variance of the resulting model estimate. The problem of basis function selection can be avoided by using a non-parametric estimator of the coefficient functions in terms of a recently proposed Least-Square Support-Vector-Machine (LS-SVM) approach. However, the selection of the model order still appears to be an open problem in the identification of LPV systems via the LS-SVM method. In this paper, we propose a novel reformulation of the LPV LS-SVM approach, which, besides of the non-parametric estimation of the coefficient functions, achieves data-driven model order selection via convex optimization. The properties of the introduced approach are illustrated via a simulation example."
1581890,14010,20896,Multi-scale Integration of Physics-Based and Data-Driven Models in Power Systems,2012,"The major subject of this paper is the introduction and testing of a new modeling paradigm necessary for enabling sustainable performance of electric energy systems. In previous work we have identified major challenges to systematically modeling distributed, non-uniform resources emerging in power grids. Today's modeling of electric energy systems is either entirely based on first principles which suffers significantly from the ever-increasing complexity of non-uniform devices, or is purely based on computer science data-driven approaches which lose the fundamental physical insights of electric power networks. Therefore, it is very difficult with today's modeling practices to integrate distributed non-uniform resources using both first-principle and data driven approaches in large-scale cyber-physical energy systems. In sharp contrast, this paper presents a holistic multi-scale modeling approach by combing advances from (1) physics based modeling of emerging distributed resources (e.g. wind generation and storage devices), and (2) data-driven modeling of load resources. With both physics-based models of distributed resources and data-driven models of flexible demands, key parameters are abstracted and identified from the detailed dynamical models necessary for the multi-scale power system operations. The proposed modeling framework is tested using realistic phasor measurement unit data obtained from Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)."
1701703,14010,9475,A point process model-based framework reveals reinforcement mechanisms in striatum during high frequency STN DBS,2012,"Striatum is a major stage of the motor loop but, despite a pivotal role in the execution of movements, it has been poorly studied thus far under Parkinsonian conditions and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). We propose a computational framework to analyze the spiking activity of striatal neurons under several conditions. This framework combines point process models and single unit recordings, and separately evaluates the effects of the spiking history, DBS frequency, and other cells on the neuronal discharge pattern, thus giving a full characterization of non-stationary neuronal dynamics and inter-neuronal dependencies. We applied this framework to 166 striatal neurons collected in a monkey both at rest and during DBS (30–130 Hz). Our analysis was conducted both before and after treatment of the animal with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which evoked Parkinsonian-like motor disorders. We reported that high frequency (≥100 Hz) DBS reduces non-stationary dynamics and inter-neuronal dependencies by regularizing the discharge patterns both in MPTP and normal striatum, while the combination of MPTP and low frequency (30–80 Hz) DBS enhances these features, thus suggesting that pattern regularization in striatum might contribute to the therapeutic effect of high frequency DBS and presumably results from the overlap of feed-forward and feedback activation along the motor loop (reinforcement)."
1720477,14010,9475,Control and sensitivity reduction for a viscous Burgers' equation,2012,"The problem of designing and numerically implementing a controller for a fluid flow system at the boundary of the flow domain is complicated by the facts that the basic model is truly nonlinear and the flow is usually highly sensitive to boundary conditions. High sensitivity to small changes in the boundary such as wall roughness or dynamic excitations can trigger transition to undesirable states. One approach to preventing or delaying a transition is to introduce a simple control loop along the boundary to reduce the sensitivity. In this work we demonstrate the aforementioned idea for a system governed by the one dimensional Burgers' equation. In particular, we focus on the initial boundary value problem for a viscous Burgers' equation which is known to be is extremely sensitive with respect to a small perturbation in a Neumann boundary condition. We use this model to illustrate how this sensitivity can generate erroneous numerical solutions and “transitions” to these states. In particular, for a fixed viscosity and certain initial data the numerical solution z(x; t) of Burgers' equation with a Neumann boundary condition z x (0; t) = 0 converges to a (large) solution that satisfies z x (0; t) = −α for a number α > 0 less than machine precision zero. Thus, the solution of the Burgers' equations for this problem exhibits an extreme sensitivity to the boundary perturbation α and this sensitivity can produce unexpected and undesired dynamic behavior. We use a continuous sensitivity equation method to compute these sensitivities and show that the sensitivity can be eliminated by introducing a very simple proportional error boundary feedback mechanism."
1029397,14010,11104,Genetic algorithm based new sequence of principal component regression (GA-NSPCR) for feature selection and yield prediction using hyperspectral remote sensing data,2012,"Recently, hyperspectral images are used to estimate the yield of food crops. The images consist of a large number of bands which requires sophisticated method for its analysis. One approach to reduce computational cost and to accelerate knowledge discovery is by eliminating bands that do not add value to the analysis. In this paper, a genetic algorithm based new sequence of principal component regression (GA-NSPCR) method is proposed and tested using 116 band HyMap airborne hyperspectral data and yield data collected from paddy fields. The proposed method uses GA to select an initial subset of hyperspectral bands, and subsequently generate a more accurate subset by measuring the minimum error of prediction model defined by principal component regression (PCR). Unlike standard PCR methods which order the features based on singular values, in each generation NSPCR orders the features based on squared multiple correlation coefficient R 2 . Yield data and spectral data are used to generate a separate training and testing dataset using 8 times bootstrap resampling (8-rounds BSR) to deal with limited number of samples in training data. Differed from standard GA impelementation, the fitness function evaluates three L p -norms to obtain the best prediction model."
859313,14010,11104,The multitemporal change analysis of deep-seated landslide - Hsiaolin Slide,2013,"Due to the active collision between Eurasian and Philippine Sea tectonic plates, the rocks of Taiwan are highly fractured and vulnerable to slope failures. In addition, Taiwan lies in the track of severe tropical cyclones known in East Asia as typhoons. Deep-seated landslides caused by heavy rainfall are usually catastrophic. One of the most catastrophic disaster is Hsiaolin Slide triggered by typhoon Morakot occurred on 9th August 2009 at Shiaolin Village in Kiaosiung City of Southern Taiwan. It was reported that 450 people died in this landslide, of which the volume was about 26 million cubic meters. Airborne LiDAR was conducted to acquire digital elevation models for landform change study after the event on 18 and 23 June 2010 and on 16 and 27 October 2010. The same area was surveyed with airborne LiDAR in 2006. Thus, three times of airborne LiDAR surveys were carried out. With the change from 2006 to June 2010, accurate landslide volume can be estimated. With the change from June to October, local slope of instability was readily identifiable on the difference image. It is concluded that multi-temporal airborne LiDAR can be an effective approach for quantifying the time-series change of deep-seated landslides in the physiographic settings of Taiwan."
910093,14010,9475,A predictor-corrector approach for multi-rate sampled-data control of spatially distributed systems,2012,"This work presents a methodology for the design of model-based output feedback controllers for spatially distributed systems modeled by highly-dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) with multiple measured outputs that are sampled at different sampling rates. Initially, an approximate finite-dimensional system that captures the dominant dynamics of the infinite-dimensional system is obtained and used to design an observer-based output feedback controller. Due to the lack of continuous measurements, an inter-sample model predictor is included in the controller and used to provide the observer with estimates of the unavailable outputs. The model predictions are then updated and corrected at each time that a measurement becomes available. Owing to the different sampling rates of the available measurement sensors, the model update is performed using different outputs, or combinations of outputs, at each update time. A hybrid system formulation that captures the model update pattern is used to analyze the stability properties of the sampled-data finite-dimensional closed-loop system and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for closed-loop stability. The condition is used to explicitly characterize the interdependence between the different sampling rates, the size of the model uncertainty, the controller and observer design parameters, and the spatial locations of the control actuators and measurement sensors. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated using a diffusion-reaction process example."
760243,14010,9475,Fluid-based cooperative underwater localization,2013,"Localization for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is difficult because of the lack of adequate light, distinguishable landmarks and global positioning system (GPS) radio frequency (RF) signals in undersea areas. Due to maneuverability limitations, small AUVs are usually susceptible to strong ocean currents. The impacts of ocean flow on vehicle motion are usually too large to be considered as disturbances. Simulations of large-scale ocean currents are available to track changes of the background flow. Fluid-based multi-vehicle path planning algorithms have been developed to achieve the feasibility in the presence of the background flow and optimized energy consumption. With certain information from both simulations and measurements of the background flow, the performance of multi-AUV cooperative localization can be improved. In this work, a multi-AUV cooperation hierarchy is proposed. More capable AUVs with bounded localization errors are used as localization references to improve the localization performance of other low-cost AUVs. The proposed algorithm is fully distributed and it is verified by using a modified extended Kalman filter (MEKF). This paper focuses on the outline of the algorithm and its associated matching techniques. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on simulations in the flow field generated by the N-vortex system. Localization errors of low-cost AUVs are all bounded at satisfactory levels. The diverging behavior of the pure cooperative localization is effectively avoided."
853749,14010,11104,A dual-phase satellite data simulation system: Framework and preliminary evaluation over China,2012,"It is very crucial for developing satellite land data assimilation system by directly assimilating the gridded satellite brightness temperature (TB) data to simulate gridded satellite observation data. A dual-phase satellite data simulation system framework is developed, which consists of the Community Land Model (CLM), microwave Land Emissivity Model (LandEM), Shuffled Complex Evolution algorithm (SCE-UA) and the gridded Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) TB data, and it is implemented in two phases: the parameter optimization and calibration phase and the satellite data simulation phase. The SCE-UA algorithm is used to optimize the LandEM parameters and calibrate microwave wetland surface emissivity by minimizing the difference between the simulated and observed BT. In this paper, the monthly mean microwave wetland surface emissivity calibrated at HeFei in 2003 are transferred to East Asia region, the dual-phase satellite data simulation system is mainly evaluated over China region. Experimental results indicated that the vertically polarized TBs (6.925 GHz and 10.65 GHz) simulated by the dual-phase satellite data simulation system are basically matched with those observed by AMSR-E sensor and the differences between the simulated and observed TBs are less than 15 K, which indicates that the calibrated microwave wetland surface emissivity possesses excellent transportability and the dual-phase satellite data simulation system is feasible and practical over China. This study provides reference for developing China satellite land data assimilation system by directly assimilating the gridded AMSR-E TB data (low-frequency and vertical polarization) for model grids contained various land cover types, especially for those model grids including wetland cover type, which will greatly improve land data assimilation study."
1747437,14010,11104,Automatic unsupervised change detection using multi-temporal polarimetric SAR data,2012,"This paper addresses the change detection capabilities of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for the L-band frequency in comparison with single- and dual-polarization and fully polarimetric SAR data. All polarization combinations are investigated quantitatively for unsupervised change detection under different topographic characteristics. In particular, highly urbanized areas, vegetated areas, and mixed topographic areas are examined. This allows optimal selection of polarization combinations that provide the highest change detection accuracy. The unsupervised change detection method applied in this study is based on a closed-loop process. Firstly, adaptive iterative filtering is used to determine the optimal filter size such that the speckle noise is sufficiently reduced. Secondly, the log-ratio image is generated from filtered SAR images and is modeled according to a Gaussian distribution. Thirdly, the Kittler-Illingworth minimum error thresholding (KI) algorithm is applied under generalized Gaussian assumptions to select double thresholding that discriminates the positively and negatively changed areas from the unchanged areas. Experimental results reveal that the combined cross-polarized (HV+VH) power data are preferable if fully polarimetric data are unavailable. The selection of filter size affects the change detection accuracy, and is dependent on the topographic characteristics."
1209477,14010,9475,A weighted least-squares method for parameter estimation in structured models,2014,"Parameter estimation in structured models is generally considered a difficult problem. For example, the prediction error method (PEM) typically gives a non-convex optimization problem, while it is difficult to incorporate structural information in subspace identification. In this contribution, we revisit the idea of iteratively using the weighted least-squares method to cope with the problem of non-convex optimization. The method is, essentially, a three-step method. First, a high order least-squares estimate is computed. Next, this model is reduced to a structured estimate using the least-squares method. Finally, the structured estimate is re-estimated, using weighted least-squares, with weights obtained from the first structured estimate. This methodology has a long history, and has been applied to a range of signal processing problems. In particular, it forms the basis of iterative quadratic maximum likelihood (IQML) and the Steiglitz-McBride method. Our contributions are as follows. Firstly, for output-error models, we provide statistically optimal weights. We conjecture that the method is asymptotically efficient under mild assumptions and support this claim by simulations. Secondly, we point to a wide range of structured estimation problems where this technique can be applied. Finally, we relate this type of technique to classical prediction error and subspace methods by showing that it can be interpreted as a link between the two, sharing favorable properties with both domains."
1129848,14010,9475,Two loop based dynamical feedback stabilization control of a diesel engine with EGR & VGT,2011,"In this paper, a fourth-order dimensional nonlinear model is proposed for a diesel engine equipped with a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) and an Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve. The referred model which takes into account the engine crankshaft speed dynamics and the air-path dynamics is a non-minimum phase unstable system. The fuel flow rate W ƒ  which is considered as input for the engine crankshaft subsystem acts as an external perturbation for the three-order dimensional non-minimum phase air-path subsystem. The global control objectives are to track desired values of engine speed, intake manifold pressure and compressor flow mass rate which can be suitably chosen according to low emission criterions. For the considered objectives two loop based dynamical feedback stabilization control is proposed: an inner loop and an outer loop. The inner loop considers a control based on Lyapunov function which realizes the desired engine speed trajectory tracking. The outer loop concerns EGR & VGT control. It is developed from a particular extended nonlinear air-path subsystem with its modified outputs. This outer loop ensures both the desired intake manifold pressure and the desired compressor mass flow rate trajectory tracking. The outer loop dynamical feedback stabilization control provides also the external fuel mass flow rate perturbation rejection. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by simulation results."
1208215,14010,11104,An automated statistical analysis approach to noise reduction for photon-counting lidar systems,2013,"Satellite-based and airborne lidar instrumentation has been demonstrated to be a strategic tool in increasing our understanding of Earth's polar cryosphere, specifically that of total mass balance, which is a significant factor in estimating sea level rise due to climate change. The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) will provide accurate estimates of local glacial topographical changes with increased measurement precision and change detection capability. Measurements obtained from the airborne Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL) instrument, an experimental photon-counting lidar - which uses multiple transmit/receive beams to resolve cross-track slope and elevation changes - are critical to project scientists to develop algorithms that will be used for the upcoming ICESat-2 mission. To aid in this effort, a new noise reduction technique has been developed. The general approach is to 1) divide the received photons into bins, 2) calculate the mode for each bin, and 3) compare each photon elevation to the mode for that bin, retaining only those photons that fall within a set threshold. Because the proposed technique uses statistical analysis to separate the surface elevation photons from the solar background photons, finding the surface return is computationally very light, making it ideal for large data sets, such as those associated with photon-counting lidars."
1157845,14010,8441,Design of a constant force clamp and estimation of molecular motor motion using modern control approach,2013,"Since its inception, optical traps have become an important tool for single molecule investigation because of its precise ability to manipulate microparticles and probe systems with a force resolution of the order of fN. Its use as a constant force clamp is of particular importance in the study of molecular motors and DNA. The highly nonlinear nature (specially the presence of hysteresis) of the force-extension relationships in such biomolecules is traditionally modelled as a linear Hookean spring for small force perturbations. For these linear models to hold, high disturbance rejection bandwidths are required so that the perturbations from the regulated values remain small. The absence of systematic design and performance quantification in the current literature is addressed by designing an optimized PI and a H ∞  controller, that significantly improve the force regulation and its bandwidth. A major application of constant force clamps is in step detection of biomolecules, where due to the presence of thermal noise, one has to extract the stepping data via postprocessing. In this paper, a real time step-detection scheme, currently lacking in literature, is achieved via a mixed objective H 2 /H ∞  synthesis. In the design, the H ∞  norm for force regulation and stepping estimation error is minimized while keeping the H 2  norm of the thermal noise on the stepping estimate is kept bounded.Since its inception, optical traps have become an important tool for single molecule investigation because of its precise ability to manipulate microparticles and probe systems with a force resolution of the order of fN.

720202,14010,9475,Integrated electric vehicle control by differential parameterization,2011,"The design of a tracking controller for electric cars in x-by-wire structure is presented to assign trajectories for the coordinates of the vehicle structure, which are shown to be a flat output. The model of the car is a detailed nonlinear two-track vehicle with all degrees of freedom in the three-dimensional space provided with redundant actuation. Each tire is equipped with two salient pole permanent magnet (PM-)synchronous machines for steering and driving. For the controller design, an overall model with a special differential-algebraic structure is derived. The tire forces and the torques of the electrical machines are used as fictitious inputs. With this particular modeling it is possible to decouple the dynamic part of the model in the given coordinates at the highest relative degree. To get a consistent behavior it is necessary to account for some algebraic constraints, in this case given by the tire model and the torque equations of the PM-synchronous machines. It is possible to parameterize all constraints and coordinates of the drive units by the coordinates of the vehicle structure and its derivatives. All these parameterizations can be derived analytically. With an additional tracking controller the approach is robust against parameter variations and pulse-shaped disturbances. The control of the electrical machines is integrated in the overall control law. By introducing additional coupling conditions it is possible to generate the desired torque for steering and driving by minimum current."
2006870,14010,11104,Optimal estimation of distributed scatterer phase history parameters from meter-resolution SAR data,2011,"Measuring the long-term line-of-sight deformation using a multipass SAR data stack by standard persistent scatterer technique has been explored since the late 1990s. Researches have been continuously conducted on increasing the data coverage at non-PS-rich areas. The recently developed SqueeSAR™ technique has validated the potential of extracting useful information from distributed scatterers. With the availability of high resolution TerraSAR-X spotlight data, this technique can benefit greatly from its higher data density and quality. This article presents an algorithm of parameter estimation at distributed scatterers by maximum likelihood estimator in high resolution TS-X spotlight data. Different to SqueeSAR™, this article pays particular attention to the accurate covariance matrix estimation for phase history retrieval on each individual distributed scatterer. Solutions are presented for adaptive sample selection by a different statistical test (Anderson-Darling). An adaptive multi-resolution defringe algorithm is introduced to cope with the problem of accurate fringe removal and in turn accurate covariance matrix estimation. And finally maximum likelihood estimator was employed to estimate the model parameters by weighting each measurement according to its coherence. By combining both the persistent scatterers and distributed scatterers, the increase in the capable monitoring area is phenomenal."
1052965,14010,11104,"Methodology to simulate GPM radar observations, from combined radiometer and radar measurements from TRMM and cloud models",2013,"The Global precipitation mission is conceptually centered on the deployment of a “core” satellite with an active dual-frequency (Ka/Ku band) precipitation radar, and microwave imager capable of sensing the total precipitation within all cloud layers (http://gpm.gsfc.nasa.gov). Compared to the single-frequency TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) precipitation radar (PR), the dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) onboard GPM core satellite is expected to enhance our understanding on microphysics, and provide more accurate retrieval of rainfall and liquid water content. The goal of the present study is to combine the TMI (TRMM's Microwave Imager), TRMM PR and a mesoscale WRF (Weather Research and Forecast) model to simulate the DPR reflectivity profiles. Prior studies to simulate the DPR profiles were done based on TRMM PR observation using frequency scaling arguments and hydrometeor classification [1]. First, the methodology to retrieve self consistent hydrometeor profiles from a combination of TMI, PR observations as well as WRF model is described. Using the TRMM constrained WRF model profiles, a procedure to simulate DPR observations is described. Attenuation from cloud water and cloud ice is considered. Simulation of cyclone Nargis shows reasonable results using TMI retrieved microphysics. Attenuations from both precipitation and non-precipitation are also compared."
930538,14010,9475,Air supply system of a PEM fuel cell model: Passivity and robust PI control,2011,"Fuel cells are widely regarded as potential future power sources, they convert the chemical energy of a gaseous fuel directly into electricity. In this paper, the study is concentrated on the control of the air subsystem that feeds the fuel cell cathode with oxygen—whose dynamics is described with a widely accepted nonlinear model. Due to the complexity of this model, the model-based controllers that have been proposed for this application are designed using its linear approximation at a given equilibrium point, which might lead to conservative stability margin estimates. On the other hand, practitioners propose the use of simple proportional or proportional-integral controllers around the compressor flow, which ensures good performance in most applications. Using some monotonicity characteristics of the system, in this paper we provide the theoretical justification to this scheme, proving that this output variable has the remarkable property that the linearization (around any admissible equilibrium) of the input-output map is strictly passive. Hence, the controllers used in applications yield (locally) asymptotically stable loops—for any desired equilibrium point and all values of the controller gains. Ensuring stability for all tuning gains overcomes the inherent conservativeness of linearized dynamics analysis, and assures robustness and high performance."
965306,14010,9475,Controlling flutter for nonlinear panels in subsonic flows via structural velocity feedback,2014,"Mechanical control of flutter for a thin panel immersed in an inviscid flow is considered. The model arises in aeroelasticity and comprises the interaction between a clamped von Karman plate a surrounding potential flow of gas. Recent results show that the plate dynamics of the model converge to a global compact attracting set of finite dimension [6]. This result was obtained in the absence of mechanical damping of any type. Here, we incorporate a sufficiently large velocity feedback control applied to the structure to show that the full flow-plate system exhibits strong convergence to a stationary state (when flows are subsonic and a “good” energy identity is available). Our method is based on first showing the desired convergence properties when the plate dynamics exhibit additional regularity. We then show a dichotomy for the plate dynamics: they are either asymptotically regular or the plate velocities decay uniformly exponentially. In the case when no additional plate regularity is available, we utilize an approximation by smooth initial data; this requires propagation of initial regularity on the infinite time horizon. The final result complements results previous obtained (for this model and similar models), as we show that there is a strong convergence for the entire dynamics and that the limiting behavior of the flow-plate system is, in fact, stationary. Physically, this implies that flutter (a non-static end behavior) can be eliminated by a velocity feedback control in subsonic flows."
1595905,14010,11104,Feasibility study of PRISM-2 onboard ALOS-3 - Simulated image generation,2013,"The special and temporal analysis is a primitive approach in the remote sensing field. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS, nicknamed `Daichi') has been operated very well from 2006 to 2011, and mainly observed global land region with fine resolutions by three sensors i.e. an L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar called PALSAR and two optical instruments called PRISM and AVNIR-2. They have been captured actual Earth's surface in to this era. As the ALOS follow-on mission, ALOS-2 is succeeded to the Radar mission of ALOS and carried on the state-of-the-art L-band SAR called PALSAR-2, and will be launched in JFY2013. On another front, the ALOS follow-on optical mission has not been approved by the government. This study describes to generate the simulated images and their evaluations for the next land observation satellite. In JAXA, the optical imager that has capabilities of a finer resolution, wide observation swath width, and stereo function are expected as the PRISM follow-on instrument tentatively called PRISM-2. To identify hardware specifications of PRISM-2 as well as utilization capability of acquired data, simulated images were generated with various parameters using the airborne line scanner, and the image quality, interpretation capacity, and the height estimation accuracy by stereo pair images were evaluated."
1454833,14010,11104,Precipitation analysis by X-band MP radar data using Google Earth,2013,"Flood damage due to heavy rain is quite severe in Japan during the annual typhoon season, which causes death and serious destruction every year. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) of Japan started the operation of the X-band Multi-Parameter (MP) radar system in February, 2012, at 23 observation stations in Japan. Several services using the X-band MP radar data have already been provided in web-based weather maps by some agencies. However, almost all these web-based weather maps only show rainfall images of precipitation per minute given by the X-band MP radar data, the back images of which are only blank maps with prefecture border lines. The MLIT website itself also shows a similar such weather map. So, such a high spatial resolution is not effective with these weather maps. Accordingly, the present study used the X-band MP radar data to develop an accumulated rainfall monitoring system on a website, which uses Google Earth pro v.6.0 and ArcGIS 10.0 (ESRI). The accumulated rainfall data contains one hour, three hour, and six hour precipitations, and is quite crucial for disaster prediction. The present accumulated rainfall monitoring system is designed to meet the needs of agencies in both the public and private sectors, with local governments playing an especially important role in predicting and monitoring flood or landslide occurrences in their jurisdiction."
1364768,14010,9475,Self recovery phenomenon of mechanical systems with an unactuated cyclic variable,2012,"Conservation laws in nature correspond to symmetries of related physical systems (Noether's theorem). Conservation of momentum, for instance, can be interpreted by the symmetric property of a certain motion variable known as the cyclic variable. If a symmetry-breaking force such as a dissipative force or the gravitational force, is applied to the cyclic variable, then the momentum is not conserved any longer in general. The main objective of this paper is to show that there exists a particular type of viscous damping-like force that breaks the symmetry but induces a new conserved quantity in place of the original momentum map. This new conserved quantity can be constructed by combining the time integral of a force linear in velocity and the original momentum map associated with the symmetry. In terms of stability theory of dynamical systems, it can be shown that the existence of the new conserved quantity implies that the corresponding motion variable possesses, as we define in this paper, the self recovery phenomenon. More specifically, the corresponding motion variable will be globally attractive to the initial condition of the variable.We discover that what is fundamental in this self recovery phenomenon is not the positivity of the coefficient of the force linear in the velocity, but certain properties of the time integral of the coefficient function, which can encompass a wide range of viscous damping forces. The self recovery effect and theoretical discoveries are demonstrated by simulation results using two examples: Elroy's beanie, and the torque-controlled inverted pendulum on a passive cart. The results in this paper will be useful in designing and controlling mechanical systems with underactuation."
1232753,14010,9475,Optimization-based estimation of random distributed parameters in elliptic partial differential equations,2012,"As simulation continues to replace experimentation in the design cycle, the need to quantify uncertainty in model outputs due to uncertainties in the model parameters becomes critical. For distributed parameter models, current approaches assume the mean and variance of parameters are known, then use recently developed efficient numerical methods for approximating stochastic partial differential equations. However, the statistical descriptions of the model parameters are rarely known. A number of recent works have investigated adapting existing variational methods for parameter estimation to account for parametric uncertainty. In this paper, we formulate the parameter identification problem as an infinite dimensional constrained optimization problem for which we establish existence of minimizers and the first order necessary conditions. A spectral approximation of the uncertain observations (via a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion) allows an approximation of the infinite dimensional problem by a smooth, albeit high dimensional, deterministic optimization problem, the so-called ‘finite noise’ problem, in the space of functions with bounded mixed derivatives. We prove convergence of ‘finite noise’ minimizers to the corresponding infinite dimensional solutions, and devise a gradient based strategy for locating these numerically. Lastly, we illustrate our method with a numerical example."
1059885,14010,9475,KPCA based multi-spectral segments feature extraction and GA based Combinatorial optimization for frequency spectrum data modeling,2011,"Mill load (ML) estimation plays a major role in improving the grinding production rate (GPR) and the product quality of the grinding process. The ML parameters, such as mineral to ball volume ratio (MBVR), pulp density (PD) and charge volume ratio (CVR), reflect the load inside the ball mill accurately. The relative amplitudes of the high-dimensional frequency spectrum of shell vibration signals contain the information about the ML parameters. In this paper, a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) based multi-spectral segments feature extraction and genetic algorithm (GA) based Combinatorial optimization method is proposed to estimate the ML parameters. Spectral peak clustering algorithm based knowledge is first used to partition the spectrum into several segments with their physical meaning. Then, the spectral principal components (PCs) of different segments are extracted using KPCA. The candidate input features are serial combinated with mill power. At last, GA with Akaike's information criteria (AIC) is used to select the input features and the parameters for the least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM) simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has higher accuracy and better predictive performance than the other normal approaches."
995619,14010,9475,Synchronization of a budding yeast cell culture by manipulating inner cell cycle concentrations,2012,"The synchronization of cell populations is an important topic not only in research but also for biotechnological production processes. Synchronization means that all cells in the culture are in the same phase of the cell cycle and that they divide, at best, in unison. A synchronized cell culture is an important topic in molecular biology to analyze cell cycle events and to understand how the cells control growth and division. It has a high potential in biotechnological production processes because many products which are of commercial interest are cell cycle dependent or are synthesized in a cell cycle dependent manner. In this work a strategy for the synchronization of an in silico budding yeast cell culture is computed and analyzed. The in silico culture is based on a single cell cycle model taken from the literature which describes the cell cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the concentrations and interactions of proteins that participate in the cell cycle. By individually setting the parameters for each cell, the model can be used to model a non-homogenous cell population. The synchronization approach followed here is based on the manipulation of the concentrations of native proteins. The variation of two parameters in the model that can be achieved by different gene expression rates leads to a modified expression of two cyclins that appear in the late G 1  phase. Dependent on the concentration of these two cyclins, the G 1  phase can be either lengthened or shortened, thus maintaining the cells in the G 1  phase or accelerating their transition to the other phases. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, the optimization is done by a memetic algorithm. The synchronization is applied to an exponential growing cell population inside a batch reactor and a chemostat. A detailed analysis of the effect of the expression levels is presented. For the chemostat, a periodic pattern for synchronizing and keeping the culture in synchrony is computed."
1657113,14010,8441,An impact-aware defense against Stuxnet,2013,"The Stuxnet worm is a sophisticated malware designed to sabotage industrial control systems (ICSs). It exploits vulnerabilities in removable drives, local area communication networks, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to penetrate the process control network (PCN) and the control system network (CSN). Stuxnet was successful in penetrating the control system network and sabotaging industrial control processes since the targeted control systems lacked security mechanisms for verifying message integrity and source authentication. In this work, we propose a novel proactive defense system framework, in which commands from the system operator to the PLC are authenticated using a randomized set of cryptographic keys. The framework leverages cryptographic analysis and control-and game-theoretic methods to quantify the impact of malicious commands on the performance of the physical plant. We derive the worst-case optimal randomization strategy as a saddle-point equilibrium of a game between an adversary attempting to insert commands and the system operator, and show that the proposed scheme can achieve arbitrarily low adversary success probability for a sufficiently large number of keys. We evaluate our proposed scheme, using a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) as a case study, through theoretical and numerical analysis."

A new turbine control problem statement with constraints on blade loads is reviewed. This problem statement allows the design of a new class of simultaneous speed and pitch control strategies based on the preview measurements and look-ahead calculations. A generation of a piecewise constant desired pitch angle profile which is calculated using the turbine load prediction is reviewed in this paper as one of the most promising approaches. This in turn allows the reduction of the pitch actuation and the design of the collective pitch control strategy with the maximum possible actuation rate. Two turbine speed control strategies based on one-mass and two-mass models of the drivetrain are also described in this paper. The strategies are compared to the existing drivetrain controller. Moreover, postprocessing technique that can be used for estimation of the turbine parameters with improved performance is also discussed. Postprocessing based estimation of the turbine inertia moment is given as an example. All the results are illustrated by simulations with a wind speed record from the Hönö turbine, located outside of Gothenburg, Sweden."
787445,14010,11104,Time series analysis of dual-pol COSMO-SkyMed images for monitoring snow cover in alpine areas,2012,"Time series of dual-polarized COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) images are exploited for detection of seasonal snow cover in Alpine areas. For the first time a complete time series of CSK images acquired during snow fall and melt period in winter 2010–2011 is addressed to verify the snow cover mapping capabilities of X-band radar images under different conditions (from dry to wet snow). The algorithm for snow detection is based on a multi-temporal approach with the concept that free water in the snowpack attenuates the X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal and wet snow can be classified by comparing images acquired under wet snow and snow-free conditions. Thresholds to make this distinction are compared across all the images to check sensitivity to different winter conditions and land-use classes. The impact on the snow cover area (SCA) detected is verified by also exploiting both polarizations in the form of Cross-pol ratio, ratio of VH channel with the reference image, and Depolarization factor, ratio between VH and VV channel of the same image. Snow maps from CSK images compared with LANDSAT ETM+ snow maps indicate a constant underestimation in the detection of snow extent especially during winter season thus showing a scarce sensitivity of X-band signals to snow in dry conditions. The presence of VH polarization indicated, however, an increase in the snow detection variable between 10 and 15%."
790728,14010,9475,Generic and generalized boundary operating points in piecewise-linear (discontinuous) control systems,2012,"Switching control strategies introducing a discontinuity in the closed-loop equations are widely used in different fields of science and engineering. When an operating point that is viable for one of the available control actions attains a switching boundary, as a process or control parameter is varied, two generic scenarios are possible: either the operating point turns into a pseudo-equilibrium on the boundary (persistence), so the stationary solution persists through the bifurcation and a sliding mode control is initiated; or it collides and disappears together with a previously coexisting pseudo-equilibrium (nonsmooth-fold), triggering a transient toward another attractor of the control system. In this paper we analyze the degenerate situation separating these two scenarios—the codimension-2 bifurcation called Generalized Boundary Equilibrium (GBE) in the literature on Filippov systems—in the special case of piecewise-linear control systems. We apply our results in power electronics, where the desired operating point often works in sliding mode. In particular, we analyze a three-dimensional model of DC-DC boost converter, where the GBE bifurcation—though occurring for non operative values of the control parameters—plays a critical role in identifying the operative regions of the electrical and control parameters."
2033808,14010,11104,Spatially penalized regression for dependence analysis of rare events: A study in precipitation extremes,2012,"Discovery of dependence structure between precipitation extremes and other climate variables (covariates) within a smaller spatial and temporal neighborhood is an important step in better understanding the drivers of this complex phenomenon as well as short-term prediction of extremes occurrence. Apart from the inherent spatio-temporal variability of the dependence, it is further complicated by the availability of the covariates at different vertical levels. The above problem can be split into three different sub-problems. Firstly, a spatio-temporal neighborhood of influence has to be discovered, which can be different for different locations. Secondly, the dependence structure between the precipitation extremes and the covariates has to be discovered within this neighborhood and thirdly, it has to be investigated whether this dependence structure can be exploited for any predictive power. Climate scientists have already discovered some physics-based relations between some of the covariates (e.g. temperature, relative humidity, precipitable water etc.) and precipitation extremes. We are exploring data-dependent alternatives for these problems and any possibility of incorporating the physics-based relations into the resulting data model. In particular, we used elastic net-based sparse optimization technique which solves all three problems of neighborhood discovery, covariate dependence discovery and predictive modeling and at the same time maintains the interpretability of the resulting model. Preliminary results look promising and show potential for some interesting knowledge discovery. We are currently exploring non-linear correlations and the alternatives to combine the physics-based relationships into the data model."
798220,14010,9475,Blind identification of sparse dynamic networks and applications,2011,"This paper considers the problem of identifying the topology of a sparsely interconnected network of dynamical systems from experimental noisy data. Specifically, we assume that the observed data was generated by an underlying, unknown graph topology where each node corresponds to a given time-series and each link to an unknown autoregressive model that maps those time series. The goal is to recover the sparsest (in the sense of having the fewest number of links) structure compatible with some a-priori information and capable of explaining the observed data. Contrary to related existing work, our framework allows for (unmeasurable) exogenous inputs, intended to model relatively infrequent events such as environmental or set-point changes in the underlying processes. The main result of the paper shows that both the network topology and the unknown inputs can be identified by solving a convex optimization problem, obtained by combining Group-Lasso type arguments with a re-weighted heuristics. As shown here, this combination leads to substantially sparser topologies than using either group Lasso or orthogonal decomposition based algorithms. These results are illustrated using both academic examples and several non-trivial problems drawn from multiple application domains that include finances, biology and computer vision."
2498816,14010,8441,Optimizing demand response of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles using quadratic programming,2013,"This paper develops a convex quadratic programming (QP) formulation for the demand response (DR) optimization of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) under time-varying electricity price signals. The work is motivated by the need for a computationally-efficient PHEV DR model that accounts for the ohmic energy losses in PHEV batteries, and is scalable to large-scale vehicle-to-grid (V2G) optimization and control applications. We use a previously-developed power-split PHEV model with an optimal power management strategy to compute the average distance-based PHEV energy consumption characteristics. Moreover, we use an equivalent circuit battery model for the PHEV's charge and discharge process. We then derive the PHEV's total fuel and electric energy cost as a quadratic function of battery state-of-charge (SOC), and show that the cost function is convex. Finally, we use a standard QP solver to optimize the PHEV's demand response for a few sample trips obtained from the U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) dataset. The achieved optimization time for a 24-hour time window with 5 min. resolution is less than 0.1 s (using a single quad-core computer). The method can hence be easily scaled for large-scale smart grid optimization and control studies."
1008455,14010,11104,An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) for the Aquarius/SAC-D soil moisture product: An investigation of forward/retrieval model asymmetries,2012,"An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) for the Aquarius/SAC-D mission has been developed for assessing the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval from passive and active L band. So far, this OSSE has been successfully exploited to study the artifacts in the retrieved soil moisture associated to: (1) uncertainties and aggregation of the ancillary parameters needed for the retrieval and (2) instrumental noise effects. However, effects due to forward and retrieval model incompatibilities have not yet been studied. In this paper, OSSE attempts to capture the influence of this effect over estimated soil moisture. The emissivity of real surfaces is very complex and is strongly dependent on land cover type and condition. In particular, surface covered by average to dense vegetation presents complex scattering properties, heavily related to canopy structure. The OSSE implements a forward model using a theoretical approach based on the electromagnetic modeling of vegetation elements and high order radiative transfer theory. In this way, the difficulties related to retrieving soil moisture from passive data with a simple model are studied. The accuracy of the soil moisture estimation is analyzed on a set of selected footprints in order to illustrate the impact of discrepancies between both models. In general, retrieved soil moisture performs worse over dense vegetated areas and under wet conditions. Furthermore, accuracy is highly dependent on land cover."
1441770,14010,9475,An initialization method for monocular visual localization of miniature aerial robots,2011,"This paper proposes a method to initiate the pose of an aerial robot from a glimpse of a monocular view during the rapid take-off. Unlike the existing filter-based methods that failed to estimate pose due to insufficient baseline, this paper utilizes a unified projective parametrization and a progressively suppressed refinement scheme for the non-planar homography estimations to tackle the baseline initialization problem, which has been notoriously and persistently encountered in the field of aerial robotics. Without pruning the elliptical uncertainty spheres iteratively in a filter-based framework as in the existing methods, the proposed method associates the unknown scene points and the pose of the agile aerial robot in a unified projective parametrization, and leverages a hypothesis-and-verify scheme to facilitate the decompositions of the non-planar homographies in line with a series of essential matrices. Moreover, a progressively suppressed strategy is introduced to minimize the hypothetic errors in the homographies and to minimize estimation divergence. Therefore, even with only a glance through a single camera onboard an aerial robot, a referable poses of the aerial robot can be initiated for the immediate navigation. In addition, the empirical results demonstrates that this method not only yields a consistent and referable estimation of the 6DoF pose of the robot in parallel with the agile movement of take-off, but also withstands the loop-closure evaluation in the 3D space."
759132,14010,9475,An islet population model of pancreatic insulin production,2013,"Glucose-induced pancreatic insulin release is the fundamental mechanism responsible for glucose homeostasis, its failure determining the clinical picture of Diabetes Mellitus. The details of the feedback loop controlling glycemia through insulin secretion have been an important subject of investigation and modeling for decades. In this note, a recently published population model is considered, whose purpose is to replicate in silico different observed phenomena such as low frequency glycemia-insulinemia oscillations, as well as concordant induction of high-frequency insulin oscillations. The basic idea underlying this model is that the pancreas behaves like a population of independent controllers (each consisting of a fundamental secreting unit, a pancreatic islet), all reacting to the same glucose stimulus, but with varying performance characteristics. This idea has been supported by a relatively wide range of simulations, aiming to replicate most important in vivo experiments concerning pancreatic insulin release. It will be shown in this note that the same mathematical structure can also replicate a set of in vitro experiments, provided that the model context is adapted to the structure of the different experiments to be simulated. More in details, the model will be shown to reproduce the double phase of insulin release during a prolonged glucose stimulus: a first phase of impulsive insulin release, immediately upon glucose administration, and a second phase of more gradual release, dependent on the potentiation effect of the secretory units."
970732,14010,11104,Analysis of effective window size in texture-based classification of 2007–2010 ALOS PALSAR 25m mosaic images,2013,"This study aims to develop a land cover texture-based classification scheme applicable for ALOS PALSAR imageries of the upper Marikina watershed acquired 2007 - 2010. From the raw dual polarization bands of HH+HV that has a ground resolution of 25m, additional bands HH/HV and NL was computed for surface texture normalization. The classification scheme was based on texture analysis using grey level co-occurrence matrix with parameters of mean, variance and angular second moment to extract imageries feature statistics. Varied window sizes from 3×3 to 29×29 in odd series was produced to generate texture-window size bands (TWS bands). Using Support Vector Machine for land cover classification, each classified TSW bands' accuracy was computed and yielded an initial result of stability on the NL band at ~78%-81% on window sizes 15-29. Additional 2,744 TWS bands with permuted window sizes of the 3 texture variable of NL band was produced and classified for accuracy assessment. In general, high dependence on variance texture variable was observed for classified TWS bands with high accuracy. These TWS bands has large window size that caused generalization of classification. For land cover change detection, given an illogical transition of land cover due to misclassification from the SVM classification, a drastic land cover was observed especially on the forest cover of the watershed from 2007-2010."
1077243,14010,9475,A model-free technique for designing fixed-order controllers,2013,"This paper suggests a model-free control design technique for unknown stable single-input-single-output (SISO) systems. In traditional control design approaches, a mathematical model of the plant is first identified using a set of measurements, then a controller is designed on the basis of this model. However, the use of such identified models, which are often subject to several uncertainties due to the complexity involved in many practical applications, usually results in degradation of the controller performance. Unlike model-based control approaches, we propose here to directly utilize the measured data in the controller design without going through a model identification. Our proposed control method consists in finding a suitable fixed-order controller for which the closed-loop frequency response is very close to a desired frequency response that describes some desired closed-loop performance indices. This problem is formulated as a minimization problem, where the objective function is defined by the integral of the squared relative error between the closed-loop frequency response and the desired frequency response. The main feature of our proposed method is that the design process does not depend on the increasing order and complexity of the system. Moreover, it enables to design low-order controllers. For simulation purposes, a PID controller is designed to illustrate the feasibility and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique."

The SMAP mission  1  is under development by NASA and is scheduled for launch late in 2014. The SMAP measurements will allow global and high-resolution mapping of soil moisture and its freeze/thaw state at resolutions from 3–40 km. These measurements will have high value for a wide range of environmental applications that underpin many weather-related decisions including drought and flood guidance, agricultural productivity estimation, weather forecasting, climate predictions, and human health risk. In 2007, NASA was tasked by The National Academies to ensure that “emerging scientific knowledge is actively applied to obtain societal benefits” by broadening community participation and improving means for use of information. SMAP is one of the first missions to come out of this new charge, and its Applications Plan forms the basis for ensuring its commitment to its users. The purpose of this paper is to outline the methods and approaches of the SMAP applications activity, which is designed to increase and sustain the interaction between users and scientists involved in mission development."
1137430,14010,9475,Utilizing Automated Demand Response in commercial buildings as non-spinning reserve product for ancillary services markets,2011,"In 2009, a pilot program was conducted to investigate the technical feasibility of bidding non-residential demand response (DR) resources into the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO) day-ahead ancillary services market as non-spinning reserves product. Three facilities, a retail store, a local government office building, and a bakery, were recruited into the pilot program and moved from automated price responsive programs to CAISO's participating load program. For each facility, hourly demand, and load curtailment potential were forecasted two days ahead and submitted to the CAISO the day before the trading day as an available resource. These DR resources were optimized against all other generation resources in the CAISO ancillary services market. Each facility was equipped with four-second real time telemetry equipment to ensure resource accountability and visibility to CAISO operators. When CAISO requests DR resources, OpenADR (Open Automated DR) communications infrastructure was utilized to deliver DR signals to the facilities' energy management and control systems. The pre-programmed DR strategies were triggered without a human in the loop. This paper describes the automated system architecture with detailed description of meter feedback in the DR signaling to maintain demand reduction at the government office building. The results showed that OpenADR infrastructure could be used for some products for the ancillary services market and DR strategies for heating ventilation and air conditioning and lighting provide fast enough response to participate in non-spinning reserve product in the ancillary services market."
2294939,14010,11104,Inland water quality monitoring in Australia,2013,"Consistent and accurate information on inland water quality over wider areas of the Australian continent are required to assess current condition and trends in response to key environmental and climatic impacts. Optical remote sensing offers a method to objectively assess this over multiple spatial scales provided retrieval algorithms are accurate. Here, we present the results of initial research aimed at exploring the optical variability in Australian inland waters and of linear matrix inversion algorithms applied to both in situ reflectance spectra and high resolution satellite data to retrieve water inland water quality parameters. In situ sampling reveals a high degree of optical variability both within and between lakes across the regions sampled with regional patterns evident; sub-tropical and tropical lakes exhibited greater optical complexity than deep lakes in mid-latitude regions. Clustering analysis indicated the presence of 8 different optical water types in the water bodies measured. The ability of the linear matrix inversion algorithm to map water quality, tested on in situ reflectance and WorldView2 image datasets, showed relative accuracy when parameter sets were sufficient to achieve algorithm closure. Improved algorithm parameterization will be required to account for the high degree in spatial and temporal optical variability observed in Australian inland waters."
1732375,14010,9475,On the role of ultrasensitivity in biomolecular control systems,2012,"One of the most important design parameters in synthetic biological circuits is the gain of the system. In many naturally occurring biological control systems, however, the precise role of the gain in ensuring accurate control is unclear. In this study, we employ control theory to explore the role of gain in osmoregulation. It has been well-documented that the upstream signalling pathways involved in this system implement high levels of ultrasensitivity, however, the role of such high gain in producing the observed perfect adaptation is not clear. Indeed, it has been argued that a simple integral feedback controller can explain osmoadaptation without the need for high gain. Here, we extend a recently developed proportional controller model for this system with the implementation of ultrasenstivity. We evaluate the performance of the resulting two controllers under different biological assumptions and allowing different levels of gain. We find that a proportional controller implementing ultrasensitivity allows more precise and faster adaptation of cell volume following an osmo-shock. Such an input-output relationship can be tuned as a filter, where the proportional controller couldn't, and thereby allowing responses to signals above a certain threshold. Our results provide insights on the potential role of gain in biological systems, and should be of interest to synthetic biologists attempting to design biomolecular control systems."
1116857,14010,8441,Robust weighted gain-scheduling H ∞ vehicle lateral dynamics control in the presence of steering system backlash-type hysteresis,2013,"A robust weighted gain-scheduling H ∞  controller for lateral motion control of in-wheel-motor-driven electric vehicles is presented in this paper. The main control objective is to track the reference yaw rate and regulate the vehicle lateral velocity, with the steering angle and the external yaw moment as two inputs. Two major challenges are dealt with. First, the backlash-type hysteresis embedded in the steering system of a ground vehicle adds a disturbance term to the system. Second, the vehicle longitudinal velocity and the tire cornering stiffness are considered variable, thus making the vehicle lateral dynamics model a linear time-varying uncertain system. The state feedback gain matrix of the controller is designed in the envelope of the weighted H ∞  performance, and solved using a linear matrix inequality tool. The relative importance of the tracking error and the steering hysteresis can be tuned by a weighting factor; and the uncertainties in the system matrices are resolved by a gain-scheduling design. In addition, the physical limitations of the actuators are treated by an eigenvalue placement technique. Simulation studies conducted in CarSim ®  show that the proposed controller is capable of attenuating the effects of both the steering system nonlinearities and the time-varying parameters."
1362999,14010,8441,Adaptive circadian argument estimator and its application to circadian argument control,2013,"Disruption of the circadian rhythm is detrimental to human well being, with consequences ranging from lower productivity, sleep disorder, to more serious health problems. Accurate estimation of circadian argument is critical to the assessment and treatment of circadian disruption. Circadian argument estimate is also essential for light-based circadian entrainment. Direct measurements of circadian rhythm markers such as dim light melatonin onset are inconvenient and acquired at best at low rate. Wearable continuous measurement such as actigraph is convenient but is masked by many other factors. In this paper, we present a new circadian rhythm estimation scheme based on a type of frequency tracker, called adaptive notch filter (ANF) which is commonly used in signal processing. ANF is designed to track the gain and phase of a single sinusoid from noisy data. We extend the classic ANF to multiple harmonics needed in circadian rhythm tracking. The local stability and high order harmonics robustness are analyzed. The highly noisy indirect measurements result in unreliable amplitude estimate, but the phase estimate is generally quite robust. We use this phase estimate combined with the light input to construct a black-box linear time varying (LPV) system description, parameterized by the phase estimate. The LPV model predicts the circadian rhythm response to light inputs and can be used for the design of light-based feedback control. The proposed modeling and control method is applied to three different models of circadian rhythm: Kronauer's human circadian model, Leloup's Drosophila circadian model and Neurospora circadian model. Simulation shows that our approach can generate reliable circadian argument estimation and effective gain-scheduled control of the circadian rhythm without any knowledge of the underlying model. The ability to generate circadian estimate, model, and control based only on input/output data opens up the tantalizing possibility of personalized circadian rhythm estimator and light therapy."
686441,14010,22232,Modeling and verification of a dual chamber implantable pacemaker,2012,"The design and implementation of software for medical devices is challenging due to their rapidly increasing functionality and the tight coupling of computation, control, and communication. The safety-critical nature and the lack of existing industry standards for verification, make this an ideal domain for exploring applications of formal modeling and analysis. In this study, we use a dual chamber implantable pacemaker as a case study for modeling and verification of control algorithms for medical devices in UPPAAL. We begin with detailed models of the pacemaker, based on the specifications and algorithm descriptions from Boston Scientific. We then define the state space of the closed-loop system based on its heart rate and developed a heart model which can non-deterministically cover the whole state space. For verification, we first specify unsafe regions within the state space and verify the closed-loop system against corresponding safety requirements. As stronger assertions are attempted, the closed-loop unsafe state may result from healthy open-loop heart conditions. Such unsafe transitions are investigated with two clinical cases of Pacemaker Mediated Tachycardia and their corresponding correction algorithms in the pacemaker. Along with emerging tools for code generation from UPPAAL models, this effort enables model-driven design and certification of software for medical devices."
658559,14010,11104,Coastal erosion mapping through intergration of SAR and Landsat TM imagery,2013,"It is important to monitor long-term coastal erosion in countries such as Australia given the majority of our population live in coastal regions. However, ground-based surveys are labour-intensive and involve significant cost when large spatial areas need to monitored. This paper presents a complementary, cost-effective approach for mapping the eroded shoreline, through integrating Landsat multispectral (MS) imagery data and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery data. This integration method overcomes the problem of data shortage associated with using a single data source. Moreover, it can extract the instant land-water interface at sub-pixel resolution. Because the extracted land-water boundaries are dynamic, a tidal model has to be applied to define the high water line. Wavelet transform and linear spectral unmixing are the two major algorithms used for extracting the land-water interface. Several inundated areas are identified at the selected study area along the coast of East Gippsland Basin, Victoria, Australia. Naturally occurring erosion is believed to be the major factor for these inundated areas. Theoretically the extracted shorelines for defining erosion can reach 1m - 2m resolution approximately."
1672877,14010,11104,Detection and mitigation of radio frequency interference in SMOS data,2012,"The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission was launched by ESA on November 2009 and it comprises a single payload Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) that measures the radiation emitted by the Earth in the protected frequency of 1.4 GHz (the L-band) and uses it to retrieve geophysical parameters. During the preparation of the mission it was foreseen that there might be some Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) affecting the data produced by SMOS and several algorithms to detect and flag the data were designed, but it has been shown at the early stages of the In-Orbit Commissioning Phase that these algorithms were un-effective. One of the first independent and self contained methods to detect, mitigate and flag data affected by RFIs was developed by DEIMOS Engenharia as part of the Level 1 Prototype Processor (L1PP) and it's fully functional since November 2010. The Detection Algorithm in L1PP uses the multi-angular SMOS data to detect the probable position of RFIs. The Mitigation Algorithm is based on a technique to remove the influence of point-like sources (like the Sun [1]) from SMOS data. The Flagging Algorithm has been developed with ESA and the Level 2 Teams so that geolocated pixels are flagged depending on the intensity of the RFI affecting them."
1973519,14010,20896,Sandboxing Controllers for Cyber-Physical Systems,2011,"Cyber-physical systems bridge the gap between cyber components, typically written in software, and the physical world. Software written with traditional development practices, however, likely contains bugs or unintended interactions among components, which can result in uncontrolled and possibly disastrous physical-world interactions. Complete verification of cyber-physical systems, however, is often impractical due to outsourced development of software, cost, software created without formal models, or excessively large or complex models where the verification process becomes intractable. Rather than mandating complete modeling and verification, we advocate sandboxing of unverified cyber-physical system controllers by augmenting the system with a verified safety wrapper that can take control of the plant in order to avoid violations of formal safety properties. The focus of this work is an automatic method, based on reach ability and time-bounded reach ability of hybrid systems, to generate verified sandboxes. The method is shown to be both more general than previous work, and allows the trade-off of increased computation time for improved reach ability accuracy. We also present an end-to-end toolkit which performs the low-level computation to generate the sandbox source code from Simulink/State flow models of a cyber-physical system."
1184481,14010,9475,Perimeter and boundary flow control for heterogeneous transportation networks,2013,"In this paper, we macroscopically describe the traffic dynamics in heterogeneous transportation networks by utilizing the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) for urban networks a widely observed relation between network-wide mean flow and density of vehicles. A generic mathematical model for multi-reservoir networks with well-defined MFDs for each reservoir is presented first. Then, an optimal control methodology is employed for the design of perimeter and boundary flow control strategies that aim at distributing the accumulation in each reservoir as homogeneously as possible, and maintaining the rate of vehicles that are allowed to enter each reservoir around a desired point, while the system's throughput is maximized. Perimeter control occurs at the periphery of the network while boundary control occurs at the inter-transfers between neighborhood reservoirs. Based on this control methodology, control actions may be computed in real-time through a linear multivariable integral feedback regulator (LQI). To this end, the heterogeneous network of Downtown San Francisco is partitioned into three homogeneous reservoirs that exhibit well-defined MFDs. These MFDs are then used to design and compare the proposed LQI regulator with a pre-timed signal control plan and a bang-bang controller. Finally, the impact of the control actions to the network is demonstrated via simulation by the use of the corresponding MFDs and other performance measures."
1004092,14010,9475,On global solution to a class of smart building-grid energy management models,2012,"This paper presents a convex relaxation of a class of smart building-grid energy management models using a semi-definite programming approach. A smart building-grid energy system is roughly defined as an interconnection of buildings and electric power grid energy resources within a clearly defined boundary, here called a smart site. A smart site is a strategic or self-interested entity that seeks to maximize some utility function subject to all applicable technical and budget constraints. The utility function is here a measure of energy efficiency. A smart site may purchase energy from or sell energy to its external environment. On one hand, traditional building energy management systems have focused on meeting the energy requirements of one or more buildings assuming that the buildings are connected to a strong or infinite-capacity utility grid. On the other hand, electric grid management systems have traditionally modeled relatively large sites as single grid nodes with simple lump load models. The contribution of the present paper is two-fold: to provide a general model that integrates and extends building and energy management models, and (b) to develop a convex relaxation of the ensuing model a solution of which yields a global lower bound. The proposed approach also provides a means to test whether any solution, for example, obtained using a heuristic method, is global, and the corresponding optimality gap."
1330401,14010,11104,Mapping hazardous low-pH material in mining environment: Multispectral and hyperspectral aproaches,2012,"The pH is one of the major chemical parameter affecting results of remediation programs carried on abandoned mines and dumps and one of the major parameters controlling heavy metal mobilization and speciation. Two approaches that contribute to pH mapping were compared. Firstly, high-altitude spectroradiometry (ASTER - Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer satellite data) together with ground-based spectroradiometry (ASD Filedspec spectroradiometer) were employed in order to identify the locations of the most significant sources of AMD discharge at the Sokolov lignite open-pit mines, Czech Republic. As a result, a map with delineated low-pH zones was created. Secondly, the feasibility of mapping surface pH on the basis of airborne multi-flight-line HyMap hyperspectral (HS) datasets was tested. The geochemical and mineral property was linked with emissivity spectra acquired in the field and laboratory. The spectral property of both AMD indicating minerals and the organic component occurring as part of mixtures proved to be identified using spectroscopy and spectral feature fitting (SFF) technique was employed to map the defined endmembers indicating a certain pH ranges in the HS image datasets."
1006372,14010,11104,Effective tree scattering at L-band,2011,"This paper investigates tree scattering effects at L-band by using a first-order radiative transfer (RT) model and truck-based measurements of brightness temperature over natural conifer stands to assess the performance of the τ−ω (tau-omega) model, a zero-order RT solution, over forest canopies. The tau-omega model accounts for vegetation effects in terms of “effective” vegetation parameters (single-scattering albedo and vegetation opacity) which represent the canopy as a whole. This approach inherently ignores multiple-scattering effects and it thus has a limited validity depending on the level of scattering within the canopy. The fact that the scattering from large forest components such as branches and trunks is significant at L-band requires that retrieved vegetation parameters be evaluated (compared) with their theoretical definitions to provide better understanding of these parameters in the soil moisture (SM) retrievals over moderately to densely vegetated landscapes. In this paper, the tau-omega model is fitted to a first-order RT model with an “effective” albedo assuming that “effective” vegetation optical depth is same as the “theoretical” opacity [1]. The “effective” albedo is found to be less than half of the “theoretical” one, which is generally around 0.5–0.6 for tree canopies at L-band. The “effective” albedo differs from the albedo of a single forest canopy element and becomes a global parameter which depends on all the processes taking place within the canopy including multiple-scattering and ground reflection."
1208679,14010,9475,Shrinking complexity of scheduling dependencies in LS-SVM based LPV system identification,2014,"In the past years, Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) identification has rapidly evolved from parametric identification methods to nonparametric methods allowing the relaxation of restrictive assumptions. For example, Least-Square Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) offer an attractive way of estimating LPV models directly from data without requiring from the user to specify the functional dependencies of the model coefficients on the scheduling variable. These methods have also been recently extended in order to automatically determine the model order directly from data by the help of regularization. Nonetheless, despite all these recent improvements, LPV identification methods still require some strong a priori such as i) the dependencies are static or dynamic, ii) it is known which variables are considered to be the scheduling or iii) all coefficient functions of the underlaying system depend on all scheduling variables. This prevents the complexity of the scheduling dependency of the model to be shrunk gradually and independently until an optimal bias-variance trade off is found. In this paper, a novel reformulation of the LPV LS-SVM approach is proposed which, besides of the non-parametric estimation of the coefficient functions, achieves data-driven coefficient complexity selection via convex optimization. The properties of the introduced approach are illustrated by a simulation study."
1206821,14010,9475,Efficient interior point methods for multistage problems arising in receding horizon control,2012,"Receding horizon control requires the solution of an optimization problem at every sampling instant. We present efficient interior point methods tailored to convex multistage problems, a problem class which most relevant MPC problems with linear dynamics can be cast in, and specify important algorithmic details required for a high speed implementation with superior numerical stability. In particular, the presented approach allows for quadratic constraints, which is not supported by existing fast MPC solvers. A categorization of widely used MPC problem formulations into classes of different complexity is given, and we show how the computational burden of certain quadratic or linear constraints can be decreased by a low rank matrix forward substitution scheme. Implementation details are provided that are crucial to obtain high speed solvers.We present extensive numerical studies for the proposed methods and compare our solver to three well-known solver packages, outperforming the fastest of these by a factor 2–5 in speed and 3–70 in code size. Moreover, our solver is shown to be very efficient for large problem sizes and for quadratically constrained QPs, extending the set of systems amenable to advanced MPC formulations on low-cost embedded hardware."
815297,14010,11104,Spatial and temporal series analysis of snow cover extent and snow water equivalent for satellite passive microwave data in the northern hemisphere (1978–2010),2012,"Snow water equivalent (SWE) is a critical parameter for climatological and hydrological studies over northern high-latitude areas. Based on the long time observation and monitoring of SWE, we can discover the climate changes tendency. Most conventional SWE retrieval algorithms, well known as NASA algorithms, depend on the difference between brightness temperatures near 19 (or 18) and 37 GHz. Until now, there are as many as 6 PMRs' data to derive hemisphere-scale snowpack since 1978. In this paper, we collected the microwave radiometry's SWE products in the Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-GRID) to do time series analysis in the northern hemisphere during the period 1978–2010, including the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE). After adjusting the systematical difference of these three snow products in winter, the snow cover extent and SWE changes for 1978–2010 are available. We found in the past 33 years, both SWE/snow mass and snow cover decreased. Besides, in order to gain the information of spatial variations of snow cover extent and SWE in the northern hemisphere, several interesting area such as China, North America, Eurasia, Siberia, and Arctic Circle are illustrated."
338004,14010,20552,A unifying framework for Linearly Solvable control,2011,"Recent work has led to the development of an elegant theory of Linearly Solvable Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs) and related Path-Integral Control Problems. Traditionally, LMDPs have been formulated using stochastic policies and a control cost based on the KL divergence. In this paper, we extend this framework to a more general class of divergences: the Renyi divergences. These are a more general class of divergences parameterized by a continuous parameter α that include the KL divergence as a special case. The resulting control problems can be interpreted as solving a risk-sensitive version of the LMDP problem. For α > 0, we get risk-averse behavior (the degree of risk-aversion increases with a) and for α < 0, we get risk-seeking behavior. We recover LMDPs in the limit as α → 0. This work generalizes the recently developed risk-sensitive path-integral control formalism which can be seen as the continuous-time limit of results obtained in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is a general theory of linearly solvable control and includes all previous work as a special case. We also present an alternative interpretation of these results as solving a 2-player (cooperative or competitive) Markov Game. From the linearity follow a number of nice properties including compositionality of control laws and a path-integral representation of the value function. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework on control problems with noise where different values of α lead to qualitatively different control behaviors."
1510840,14010,11104,The development of Microwave Vegetation indices according to WindSat data,2012,"As an important vegetation indicator, vegetation indices have become a widely used tool in vegetation parameters retrieval and condition monitoring. A newly developed MVI was deduced and evaluated using WindSat data. During the deduction, the σ−τ model was utilized as the theory foundation. The emission from ground can be rearranged into a two component model including the vegetation emission component and the vegetation transmission component. In order to characterize the frequency dependence of surface emission signals on the objective of minimizing the effects of the ground surface emission signals, we have built a simulation database for the configurations of WindSat using the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) at 6.8, 10.7, and 18.7 GHz, dual-polarization (v and h) and the corresponding incidence angles. Unlike previous MVIs, this simulation contains both Gaussian and Exponential correlation surfaces. On the basis of simulation data analysis, we found that bare soil emissivity at two adjacent WindSat frequencies has a linear relationship, which makes it possible to minimize the surface emission signal and maximize the vegetation signal. As a result, brightness temperature at a higher frequency can be a function of the adjacent lower frequency at the same polarization, whose slope and intercept are the newly developed Microwave Vegetation Index (MVI) from WindSat data. The new MVI shared the same vegetation distribution pattern as AMSR-E based MVIs and was also negative to NDVI."
1146720,14010,9475,Consensus and polarization in Altafini's model with bidirectional time-varying network topologies,2014,"The mechanism of reaching consensus in multi-agent systems has been exhaustively studied in recent years, motivated by numerous applications in engineering and science. Most consensus algorithms examined in the literature are based on the assumption about mutual trust and cooperation between the agents, implemented in the form of attractive couplings between the agents that render the values of the agents' states closer. However, in opinion dynamics of social groups, competition or antagonism between some pairs of agents is ubiquitous, which is usually characterized by the repulsive coupling, and may lead to clustering and polarization of opinions. A simple yet insightful model of opinion dynamics with antagonistic interactions was proposed recently by C. Altafini, which examined conventional first-order consensus algorithms with static signed interaction graphs, where the positive weight of an arc implies cooperation between the two agents and the negative one corresponds to antagonism. This protocol establishes modulus consensus, where the opinions become the same in modulus but may differ in sign. In the present paper, we extend the modulus consensus model to the case where the network topology is time-varying and undirected. We give necessary and sufficient conditions under which the consensus protocol with the time-varying signed Laplacian establishes agreement of opinions in moduli, whose signs may be opposite, so that the agents' opinions either reach consensus or polarize."
1649191,14010,8441,Generalized model predictive static programming and its application to 3D impact angle constrained guidance of air-to-surface missiles,2013,"A new `generalized model predictive static programming (G-MPSP)' technique is presented in this paper in the continuous time framework for rapidly solving a class of finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems with hard terminal constraints. A key feature of the technique is backward propagation of a small-dimensional weight matrix dynamics, using which the control history gets updated. This feature, as well as the fact that it leads to a static optimization problem, are the reasons for its high computational efficiency. It has been shown that under Euler integration, it is equivalent to the existing model predictive static programming technique, which operates on a discrete-time approximation of the problem. Performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated by solving a challenging three-dimensional impact angle constrained missile guidance problem. The problem demands that the missile must meet constraints on both azimuth and elevation angles in addition to achieving near zero miss distance, while minimizing the lateral acceleration demand throughout its flight path. Both stationary and maneuvering ground targets are considered in the simulation studies. Effectiveness of the proposed guidance has been verified by considering first order autopilot lag as well as various target maneuvers."
1830637,14010,11104,An experimental study of enhancement of the cross-range resolution of ISAR imaging using ISDB-T digital TV based passive bistatic radar,2011,"Passive bistatic radars (PBRs) exploit existing transmitters such as TV broadcasts, radio broadcasts, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), etc., as the source of illumination. PBR consists of two receivers, with one antenna pointed at the source and the other at the target, and the target range is determined by correlating the signal scattered by the target with the signal directly arrived at the receiver. Since PBR dode not transmit any wave form, it consumes lower power, and no frequency allocation is required. We are investigating the tharget imaging capability of PBR. In This paper an experimental study on obtaining Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) image with cross-range resolution of a few meters, using terrestrial digital TV baseb PBR. In this study, we conducted a field experiment to observe some aircraft targets. Due to the relatively low frequency band employed by the digital TV broadcast system, a very wide synthetic aperture angle is required to obtain a few meters cross-range resolution. Using the data acquired in the experiment, we show the limit of the range Doppler processing approach and we investigate the advantage of the Polar Format Algorithm (PFA). We also discuss the issue on autofocus and show results of initial study on autofocus algorithms."
2060839,14010,11104,Orientation angle estimation over forested terrain using P-band POLSAR data,2012,"One important secondary objective of the proposed Earth-Explorer Candidate Mission BIOMASS is the retrieval of a digital terrain model (DTM) using satellite-borne P-band SAR data. The interferometric phase acquired in repeat-pass mode may be affected by ionospheric effects leading to corrupted phase estimates and, consequently, to errors in the derived DTM. In contrast, line-of-sight orientation angles induced by azimuth slopes can be estimated using single-pass POLSAR measurements. The orientation angle estimates allow a necessary pre-processing of POLSAR observations and the retrieval of topographic information such as a DTM. In this study, the performance of the circular polarization method for orientation angle estimation is examined over forested areas. To this end, the orientation angles computed from P-band POLSAR data are compared with the results obtained from LIDAR DTMs. In particular, the estimation performance is investigated with respect to the impact of topography and vegetation. POLSAR data at P-band are used that have been acquired by the E-SAR system of DLR over three forested test sites: two boreal forests in Sweden (one over flat terrain located at Remningstorp, the other over terrain with topographic variations at Krycklan) and the tropical forest Mawas in Indonesia over flat terrain."
2517915,14010,11104,Aster/TIR vicarious calibration activities in the last 11 years,2011,"Since March 2000, the project science team for the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) onboard NASA's Terra satellite has conducted vicarious calibration (VC) experiments periodically to verify the onboard calibration (OBC) of ASTER thermal infrared (ASTER/TIR) bands. In the present paper, 287 matchup data obtained from ten experimental sites by three organizations are analyzed. The radiance difference of OBC and VC shows almost no correlation with surface temperature and precipitable water vapor at each experimental site, but shows some dependence on the type of the experimental site. For example, the OBC-VC comparisons at Cold Springs Reservoir (NV) which is a small water body shows some bias due to the straylight effect of ASTER/TIR. The comparisons at Lake Kussharo covered by snow also show some bias maybe because of an extrapolation effect of ASTER radiometric calibration. The comparisons at Mauna Loa lava flows show a large deviation due to non-uniformity of surface temperature caused by the rough surface. Except for these cases, the results show that the latest version of radiometric calibration coefficients (version 3.×) for ASTER/TIR has been keeping the designed accuracy (1 K for the temperature range of 270 to 320 K)."
791195,14010,9475,Belief convergence to facilitate cooperative behaviors,2012,"In Artificial Intelligence (AI), utility functions are used to compare the relative goodness of an AI system making one decision over another. These utility functions, along with their coefficients and parameters, comprise a set of beliefs. The term “belief” is used to describe how autonomous systems associate quantified confidences in the existence of things that make up their worldly knowledge; hence, decisions made by an AI system are governed by the states of its belief. Just as in control system theory where the states are quantities used to estimate and describe the behaviors of electrical and/or mechanical systems, belief states are quantities that are used to describe and estimate decision making characteristics. For evolving AI systems (e.g., ones that change their belief states over time through learning) and heterogeneous systems (e.g., ones that do not share a common notion of a global belief), it is important to develop mechanisms that will allow these systems to converge their beliefs, where they can determine how each other “thinks.” This is important since it will allow each agent in a cooperating collective to make decisions that optimally solves their individual needs, along with their collective needs, without requiring explicit communication or a mediator. In this paper, methodologies are presented that facilitate belief convergence. The significance of this study is that we demonstrate how a state observer, such as a Kalman filter, can be used by each agent in a collective to estimate neighboring belief states. This is done with no a priori information of their neighbors' belief states, and by only comparing each individual's estimate for the required effort of the whole collective to perform a group plan."
1122024,14010,8441,Minimum perturbation coordinates on SO(3),2013,"Systems that use internal shape changes to control their orientation in space have interested the geometric controls community for some time. Examples include the classic problem of a falling cat and the more applied attitude control of satellites. The dynamics of these systems are dominated by conservation of angular momentum, which induces a set of constraints between changes in shape and spatial orientation. This relationship can be combined with Lie bracket theory to identify shape changes that produce desired net rotations. The major weakness of the Lie bracket approach is that it only works for relatively small-amplitude motions; these methods depend on a local linearization of the system dynamics, which breaks down as larger motions are considered. Recent work on a related problem, planar locomotion, has shown that this breakdown can be mitigated by identifying a set of minimum perturbation coordinates for the system; application of Lie bracket theory in the minimum perturbation coordinates allows these methods to be applied to a broader and more interesting class of shape changes. In this work, we bring the derivation of minimum perturbation coordinates to the space of three-dimensional rotations. We show that as a result, we are able to derive visual tools that provide the control designer intuition into selecting cyclic controllers for inertial systems in free flight. These tools are demonstrated on a minimal satellite model taken from the literature."
2296266,14010,11104,Detection method of slope failures due to the 2009 sumatra earthquake by using TerraSAR-X images,2011,"This paper describes a slope failure detection method by using high resolution SAR satellite images when the disaster occurs. We have proposed the detection method of slope failures by using the optical sensor image in such a situation. The optical sensor images are not applied to observe the ground surfaces if the clouds cover the suffered area. On the other hand, the SAR images are effective for the cloudy whether because the micro wave passes the clouds. Therefore, the SAR image can be used for an urgent observation when the disaster occurs. When the remote sensing image is applied to disaster prevention, the concept of time is important. It is demanded to understand the outline of damage immediately after the occurrence of the earthquake. In this research, we proposed a slope failure detector using high resolution SAR satellite (TerraSAR-X (TSX) and TanDEM-X (TDX)) images. The proposed method was applied to the detection of large number of earthquake induced slope failures in the Padang Pariaman prefecture triggered by the 2009 Sumatra earthquake in West Sumatra, Indonesia. The conclusions are shown as follows. (1) The case of two time series TSX image was used, the main scape was possible to distinguish easily by using color composite image. (2) When the TSX image after the earthquake and local incidence angle were used, the main scape was able to be detected by the accuracy of about 65%. (3) InSAR analysis was done by using TDX image after the earthquake, and clear interferogram appeared in slope failure area. Therefore, the InSAR analysis was effective to the detection of slope failures."
1096607,14010,9475,Robust economic MPC for a power management scenario with uncertainties,2011,"This paper presents a novel incorporation of probabilistic constraints and Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) with economic Model Predictive Control (MPC). Hereby the performance of the controller is robustyfied in the presence of both model and forecast uncertainties. Economic MPC is a receding horizon controller that minimizes an economic objective function and we have previously demonstrated its usage to include a refrigeration system as a controllable power consumer with a portfolio of power generators such that total cost is minimized. The main focus for our work is power management of the refrigeration system. Whereas our previous study was entirely deterministic, models of e.g. supermarket refrigeration systems are uncertain, as are forecasts of outdoor temperatures and electricity demand. The linear program we have formulated does not cope with uncertainties and thus it is, liable to drive an optimal solution to an infeasible or very expensive solution. The main contribution of this paper is the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) formulation of the system models, allowing us to describe and handle model uncertainties in the framework of probabilistic constraints. Our new solution using this setup for robustifying the economic MPC is demonstrated by simulation of a small conceptual example. The scenario is primarily chosen to illustrate the effect of our proposed method in that it can be compared with our previous deterministic simulations."
1317003,14010,9475,Autostabilizing airframe articulation: Animal inspired air vehicle control,2012,"The sparse sensing and limited articulation that are characteristic of human-engineered robotic systems contrast dramatically with sensorimotor systems observed in nature. Animals are richly imbued with sensors, have many points of articulation and are heavily over-actuated. In fact, the compliant nature of the body (or Plant) of most animals requires constant control input to the muscles for postural maintenance. In this study, we show how flying insects use a compliant airframe to maintain flight stability via active articulation of the frame. We first derive the equations of motion for a model flying insect, inspired by the hawkmoth, a large fast flying and agile insect. By linearizing the equations of motion about a hovering equilibrium, we demonstrate that abdominal motions are sufficient to stabilize flight on a scale of 50ms. We then tested whether these insects use the abdomen for flight control by first measuring the open-loop transfer function between visual pitch rotations and abdominal movement in a tethered moth preparation. The measured transfer function was consistent with an abdominal control strategy. We then closed the loop and found that moths actively stabilize visual pitch rotations using abdominal motion as the only control input. The behavior was robust to variations in gain and to a variety of visual stimuli. These experiments establish airframe articulation as a plausible control mechanism for active flight."
825747,14010,9475,Design and implementation of an atomic force microscope with adaptive sliding mode controller for large image scanning,2011,"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is an advanced technique which aims to scan a sample through the use of a probe or a tip; however, conventional atomic force microscope system suffers from the limitation of small scanning range, due to the short travelling range of piezoelectric actuation. In this paper, we propose a large measurement- range AFM scanning system which combines both fine positioners of piezoelectric and electromagnetic actuations. While the piezoelectric positioner provides high speed scanning with nanometer resolution, the precision electromagnetic positioner is capable of 1 mm 2  large field positioning with 30 nm rms error. The overall design of the stage consists of 4 pairs of electromagnetic actuator, monolithic serial flexure guidance with compression springs, an eddy current damper, and a commercial xyz piezoelectric positioner. Besides, a stationary compact disk/digital versatile disk pick-up-head (CD/DVD PUH) is used to measure the amplitude of samples. Moreover, an adaptive sliding mode controller based on the analytical modeling is used to overcome the unmodeled system uncertainties and external disturbances. Finally, preliminary experiments are presented, demonstrating feasibility of the proposed system."
913392,14010,8441,Latent storage-enhanced distributed temperature control in hydrogen microreactors,2013,"Microchannel catalytic plate reactors are a promising route for converting methane from geographically distributed sources (e.g., shale gas deposits) to hydrogen or liquid transportation fuels. Their capacity is easily scalable by increasing the number of units and thus well suited to distributed production needs. However, miniaturization inevitably reduces the number of available actuators and sensors, and the control of these inherently distributed systems presents challenges. In the present paper, we concentrate on autothermal microchannel reactors producing hydrogen via methane-steam reforming, and introduce a novel temperature control strategy based on the use of a layer of phase-change material (PCM) confined between the reactor plates. The PCM layer, which mitigates temperature excursions through melting-solidification occurring due to fluctuations in hydrogen production rate, acts as the distributed tier of a hierarchical control structure. The supervisory layer consists of a model-based feedforward controller. We also introduce a novel stochastic optimization method for selecting the PCM layer thickness (i.e., for distributed controller “tuning”). The proposed approach is tested in simulations carried out on a detailed 2D reactor model, showing excellent disturbance rejection performance."
1147635,14010,9475,"Control, monitoring and reconfiguration of sampled-data hybrid process systems with actuator faults",2011,"This work presents an integrated model-based framework for control, fault detection and control system reconfiguration of hybrid process systems with measurement sampling rate constraints and actuator faults. A family of output feedback controllers are initially synthesized to stabilize each fault-free subsystem with the aid of a dynamic inter-sample model predictor for each mode. The stability properties for each closed-loop subsystem are then analyzed to obtain the maximum allowable sampling period together with an explicit characterization of the fault-free behavior of each mode. Conditions that guarantee asymptotic stability of the overall switched system are also derived and used to examine the interplay between the selection of the sampling period, the model, the controller and observer design parameters, and the dwell time for each mode. To detect actuator faults within a given mode, a time-varying alarm threshold based on the fault-free behavior is obtained and used, and when faults are detected, actuator reconfiguration is performed to maintain closed-loop stability. A key idea of the reconfiguration strategy is to take into account not only the stability properties of the current mode, but also the stabilizing ability and availability of the fall-back actuator configurations for the future modes. The design and implementation of the developed methodology are demonstrated using a hybrid chemical reactor example."
1222223,14010,9475,DFK control design for nonlinear systems,2012,"We propose an approach for the direct design from data of controllers finalized at solving tracking problems for nonlinear systems. This approach, called Direct FeedbacK (DFK) design, overcomes relevant problems typical of the standard design methods, such as modeling errors, non-trivial parameter identification, non-convex optimization, and difficulty in nonlinear control design. Considering a Set Membership (SM) setting, we provide two main contributions. The first one is a theoretical framework for the stability analysis of nonlinear feedback control systems, in which the controller ̂f is an approximation identified from data of an ideal inverse model f o . In this framework, we derive sufficient conditions under which ̂f stabilizes the closed-loop system. The second contribution is a technique for the direct design of an approximate controller f* from data, having suitable optimality and sparsity properties. In particular, we show that f* is an almost-optimal controller (in a worst-case sense), and we derive a guaranteed accuracy bound, which can be used to quantify the performance level of the DFK control system. The technique is based on convex optimization and sparse identification methods, and thus avoids the problem of local minima and allows an efficient on-line controller implementation in real-world applications."
1550448,14010,8441,Operational planning in energy networks based on microgeneration,2013,"A promising and shortly emerging energy supply chain network based on small-scale microgeneration through micro combined heat and power systems is proposed, modeled and optimized in this work. Interchange of electrical energy can take place among the members of this regional microgrid, which is connected to the main electrical grid for potential power interchange with it. A mathematical programming framework is developed for the operational planning of such energy supply chain networks. The minimization of operating and trade costs under full energy demand satisfaction constitutes the optimization goal of this study. Additionally, an alternative microgrid structure that allows the heat interchange within subgroups of the overall microgrid is proposed, and the initial mathematical model is extended to deal with this new aspect. An illustrative example is presented in order to highlight the particular significance of selecting a proper optimization goal that thoroughly takes into account the major operational, technical and economic driven factors of the problem in question. Also, a number of real-world size case studies are used to illustrate the efficiency and the potential benefits of the suggested microgeneration energy supply chain networks. Finally, some concluding remarks are drawn and future research directions towards the treatment of uncertainty and the on-line management of such energy systems are identified."
1142576,14010,9475,A Generalized Kalman Consensus Filter for wide-area video networks,2011,"Distributed analysis of video captured by a large network of cameras has received significant attention lately. Tracking moving targets is one of the most fundamental tasks in this regard and the well-known Kalman Consensus Filter (KCF) has been applied to this problem. However, existing solutions do not consider the specific characteristics of video sensor networks, which are necessary for robustness across various application scenarios. Cameras are directional sensors with limited sensing range (field-of-view), and thus, targets are often not observed by many of the cameras. The network may also be spread over a wide area, preventing direct communication between all of the cameras. This limited field-of-view, combined with sparse communication and coverage topologies, motivates us to propose modifications to the traditional KCF framework. Specifically, we consider the covariance matrices of the state estimates of the neighbors and compute a weighted average consensus estimate at each node. Also, the update at each node is computed in two steps, first towards the weighted consensus estimate and then towards the final Kalman measurement update. This leads us to propose a Generalized KCF herein. Experimental results clearly show the advantage of the GKCF compared to the KCF in the considered application scenario."
1264201,14010,8441,An LPV discrete-time controller for the rejection of harmonic time-varying disturbances in a lightweight flexible structure,2013,"In this work, control system design and implementation for active vibration control (AVC) of flexible structures with piezoelectric actuators is studied. The goal is to reduce the effect of harmonic disturbances with known time-varying frequencies acting on a system. As a test bed, a thin flexible aluminum cantilevered beam with two symmetrically bonded piezoelectric actuators is used. The harmonic excitation is generated by two DC motors each of them with an unbalanced mass. A discrete-time model is obtained through black-box system identification methods. The control algorithm design is based on a plant description with a disturbance model as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system in linear fractional transformation (LFT) form. This results in a gain-scheduled controller where the harmonic disturbance frequencies are the scheduling variables. The experimental real-time results show the effectiveness of the controller and its capability to suppress time-varying harmonic disturbances, whose frequencies are measured directly from the DC motors. The design method leads to a controller that stabilizes the closed-loop system even for arbitrarily fast changes in the disturbance frequencies. In the real-time experiment, the controller suppresses a disturbance consisting of two independent harmonics with frequencies that vary over a range of 15 Hz."
1798434,14010,9475,Tree codes improve convergence rate of consensus over erasure channels,2012,"We study the problem of achieving average consensus between a group of agents over a network with erasure links. In the context of consensus problems, the unreliability of communication links between nodes has been traditionally modeled by allowing the underlying graph to vary with time. In other words, depending on the realization of the link erasures, the underlying graph at each time instant is assumed to be a subgraph of the original graph. Implicit in this model is the assumption that the erasures are symmetric: if at time t the packet from node i to node j is dropped, the same is true for the packet transmitted from node j to node i. However, in practical wireless communication systems this assumption is unreasonable and, due to the lack of symmetry, standard averaging protocols cannot guarantee that the network will reach consensus to the true average. In this paper we explore the use of channel coding to improve the performance of consensus algorithms. For symmetric erasures, we show that, for certain ranges of the system parameters, repetition codes can speed up the convergence rate. For asymmetric erasures we show that tree codes (which have recently been designed for erasure channels) can be used to simulate the performance of the original “unerased” graph. Thus, unlike conventional consensus methods, we can guarantee convergence to the average in the asymmetric case. The price is a slowdown in the convergence rate, relative to the unerased network, which is still often faster than the convergence rate of conventional consensus algorithms over noisy links."
2488819,14010,11104,Artificial Neural Network (ANN) beyond cots remote sensing packages: Implementation of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in MATLAB,2012,"The transfer of knowledge from research community to specialized remote sensing software has been extremely slow hindering the application of ANN techniques in remote sensing field. There are many variants of ANN depending upon its topology and its learning paradigms but Multilayer perception (MLP) with back propagation (BP) is widely used in remote sensing despite its limitation such as fine tuning of numbers of input parameters such as learning rate, momentum, number of hidden layers and number of hidden nodes. In this paper, recently proposed Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) version of ANN which is extremely fast and does not require any iterative learning is introduced. In ELM classifier, only number of neurons required has to be fine-tuned unlike numerous parameters in MLP. To disseminate, its use to wider audience in remote sensing field, its implementation in MATLAB in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is described. The developed GUI is capable of handling large image files by employing a smarter technique of supplying rectangular chunk of image data through object oriented image adapter class and provides a simple and effective computation environment for performing ELM classification with accuracy assessment."
2568590,14010,11104,Fast and accurate shadow region imaging algorithm using range derivatives of doubly scattered signals for UWB radars,2011,"UWB (Ultra Wideband) radars have great promise for near field sensing systems, holding its high range resolution. It is particularly suitable for robotic or security sensors that must identify a target in optically blurry visions. Some recently developed radar imaging algorithms proactively employ multiple scattered components, which can enhance an imaging range compared to synthesizing a single scattered component. We have already proposed the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) method considering a double scattered, which successfully expanded a reconstructible range of radar imagery with no preliminary knowledge of target or surroundings. However, this method requires an intensive computation and its spatial resolution is insufficient for clear boundary extraction such as edges or specular surfaces. As a substantial solution, this paper proposes a novel shadow region imaging algorithm based on a range derivative of double scattered signals. This new method accomplishes high-speed imaging, including a shadow region without any integration process, and enhances the accuracy with respect to clear boundary extraction. Some results from numerical simulations verify that the proposed method remarkably decreases the computation amount compared to that for the conventional method, enhancing the visible range of radar imagery."
1676223,14010,11104,Subsidence monitoring in coal area using time-series InSAR combining persistent scatterers and distributed scatterers,2014,"In coal mining areas, ground subsidence persistently happens, which produces serious environmental issues and affects the development of cities. To monitor the ground deformation due to coal mining, a modified time-series InSAR technique combining persistent scatterers (PSs) and distributed scatterers (DSs) is presented in this paper. In particular, DSs are efficiently identified using classified information and statistical characteristics. Furthermore, a two-scale network is introduced into traditional PSI to deal with PSs and DSs in a multi-layer framework by taking the advantage of the robust of PSs and the widely distribution of DSs. The proposed method is performed to investigate the subsidence of Huainan City, Anhui province (China), during 2012-2013 using 14 scenes of Radarsat-2 images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can ease the estimation complexity and significantly increase the spatial density of measurement points, which can provide more detailed deformation information. Result shows that there are obvious subsidence areas detected in the test site with subsidence velocity larger than 5 cm/year. The proposed method brings practical applications for non-urban area deformation monitoring. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
862951,14010,8441,Quasi-decentralized output feedback model predictive control of networked process systems with forecast-triggered communication,2013,"This work presents a framework for quasi-decentralized output feedback model predictive control (MPC) design with an adaptive forecast-triggered communication strategy. Based on distributed Lyapunov-based control, an MPC controller is initially designed for local control of every subsystem in the entire networked process system. A supervisory observer that has access to the process input and output information generates estimates of the process state. And the state estimates can be used to update the model states of the local controllers and we show that this quasi-decentralized MPC design is able to practically stabilize the entire networked process system if the model states are updated at every sampling instant. In order to minimize the communication from the supervisory observer to the local control systems, an adaptive forecast-triggered communication strategy is proposed. A key idea of this strategy is to forecast the future evolution of each subsystem and generate a worst-case estimate by using the closed-loop stability properties as well as the information about the current operating status of each subsystem. Whenever the forecast indicates possible instability in the future, the observer estimate will be immediately transmitted to update the model state within the control system that needs attention in order to preserve stability; if the forecast shows no signs of instability, then the local control system will continue to rely on the model. The implementation of the developed methodology is demonstrated using a simulated model of a chemical process."
1732263,14010,9475,Fold-change detection as a chemotaxis model discrimination tool,2012,"Fold-change detection (FCD) is the property that a dynamical system with an adapting output will exhibit identical transient output responses when its input signals are scaled. This feature was recently demonstrated in the chemotactic response of the bacterium Escherichia coli, confirming earlier theoretical predictions. The chemotaxis pathway of the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides has the same modular structure as that in E. coli but is significantly more complex in that it has multiple homologues of the latter's chemotaxis proteins and features two, rather than one, chemosensory cluster. Recent experimental results suggest that R. sphaeroides may also exhibit FCD. In this paper, we present a set of theoretical assumptions on the dynamics of the R. sphaeroides chemosensory system, and use these to fit an integrated chemotaxis model to experimental data. We then show that the assumptions we place are sufficient to make FCD a robust property of this chemotaxis pathway, in agreement with preliminary experimental evidence. We argue that the fact that the model we present here is able to reproduce this transient dynamic property whilst earlier models cannot makes FCD a useful tool for model discrimination on the basis of transient dynamic response. This is in contrast to earlier model discrimination methods which tested the validity of models based on their ability to reproduce a finite set of experimental data. Further experiments that can provide additional validation of our theoretical assumptions are suggested."
602935,14010,9475,First-passage time calculations for a gene expression model,2014,"The stochastic nature of gene expression can lead to significant cell-to-cell variability in the time at which a certain protein level is attained. This is reflected in the timing of cellular events triggering at critical protein thresholds as well. A problem of interest is to understand how cells regulate gene expression to ensure precise timing of important events. To this end, we consider a gene expression model assuming constitutive expression in translation bursts. We also assume the proteins to be stable. The event timing is formulated as a first-passage time (FPT) problem and stochasticity in FPT for this model is quantified. We also investigate the effect of auto-regulation, a control mechanism often present in cells, on the stochasticity of FPT. In particular, we ask: given FPT threshold of proteins and mean FPT, what form of auto-regulation minimizes variance in FPT? Our results show that the objective is best achieved by having no auto-regulation. Moreover, a smaller mean burst size would result into lower stochasticity. We discuss our results in context of lysis time of E. coli cells infected by a λ phage virus. An optimal lysis time provides evolutionary advantage to λ phage, suggesting a possible regulation to minimize its stochasticity. Our results are consistent with previous studies showing there is no auto-regulation of the protein responsible for lysis. Moreover, congruent with experimental evidences, our analysis predicts that the expression of the lysis protein should have a small burst size."
1565580,14010,11104,Optimizing LUT-based radiative transfer model inversion for retrieval of biophysical parameters using hyperspectral data,2012,"Inversion of radiative transfer models using a lookup-table (LUT) approach against hyperspectral data streams leads to retrievals of biophysical parameters such as chlorophyll content (Chl), but necessary optimization strategies are not consolidated yet. Here, various regularization options have been evaluated to the benefit of improved Chl retrieval from hyperspectral CHRIS data, being: i) the role of added noise, ii) the role of multiple best solutions, and iii) the role of applied cost functions in LUT-based inversion. By using data from the ESA-led field campaign SPARC (Barrax, Spain), it was found that introducing noise and opting for multiple best solutions in the inversion considerably improved retrievals. However, the widely used RMSE was not the best performing cost function. Three families of alternative cost functions were applied here: information measures, minimum contrast and M-estimates. We found that so-called ‘Power divergence measure’, ‘Trigonometric’ and spectral measure with ‘Contrast function K(x)=−log(x)+x’ outperformed RMSE. The whole inversion approach, including more than 60 different cost functions, has been implemented in the ARTMO (Automated Radiative Transfer Models Operator) GUI toolbox and can easily be applied to other kinds of multispectral or hyperspectral images."
1542161,14010,9475,Fundamentals of economic model predictive control,2012,"The goal of most current advanced control systems is to guide a process to a target setpoint rapidly and reliably. Model predictive control has become a popular technology in many applications because it can handle large, multivariable systems subject to hard constraints on states and inputs. The optimal steady-state setpoint is usually provided by some other information management system that determines, among all steady states, which is the most profitable. For an increasing number of applications, however, this hierarchical separation of information and purpose is no longer optimal or desirable. A recently proposed alternative to the hierarchical decomposition is to take the economic objective directly as the objective function of the control system. In this approach, known as economic MPC, the controller optimizes directly in real time the economic performance of the process, rather than tracking to a setpoint. The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how to design these kinds of control systems and what kinds of closed-loop properties one can achieve with them. We cover the following issues: asymptotic average performance; closed-loop stability and convergence, strong duality and dissipativity; designing terminal costs, terminal regions, and terminal periodic constraints. Several examples are included to illustrate these results."
2054365,14010,11104,New differential SAR tomography functionalities for probing 3D forest structure and dynamic processes,2011,"The interest for advanced methods of full 3D SAR imaging of volumetric forest scatterers is rapidly increasing. In particular, multibaseline SAR tomographic elevation beamforming i.e. spatial spectral estimation is a promising technique. Recently, this concept has been integrated with the differential interferometry concept, producing the new differential tomography mode which yields ‘space-time’ signatures of scattering dynamics in the SAR cell. Based on this framework, we develop new tomographic functionalities to allow extracting geometric and dynamic information of forest layers. First, we show a new tomographic method robust to temporal decorrelation, arising during the synthesis of the tomographic array. A parametric method matched to non-line spectra is applied to decouple the nuisance temporal signal histories in the spatial spectral estimation. Second, we propose a new differential method aiming to overcome the limitations of classic differential interferometry in scenarios with interfering volumes. In particular, we focus on the possibility of monitoring subcanopy ground subsidences. Finally, a last new functionality is proposed to retrieve information on different temporal decorrelation mechanisms of overlayed scatterers. Simulated and first airborne real data results are reported."

This is not a trivial problem, as there are many possible combinations of model terms and exhaustive search is not an option when the number of possible model terms is large. Most existing fast approaches such as orthogonal least squares (OLS), fast recursive algorithm (FRA) and their variants serve the purpose of fast selection. However, these stepwise forward methods are greedy approaches in general and the resultant models are not optimal. Further, they do not control the model complexity (i.e. automatically stop the model selection). The two stage algorithm may improve the compactness of models obtained from forward algorithms, again, it does not determine how many model terms are necessary. Recently, some cross validation based methods have been proposed for automatic model construction, based on leave-one-out (LOO) criteria and OLS or FRA, however the issues related to the forward selection algorithms still exist. Further, LOO based methods are computationally expensive as the model often has to be trained N times (N is the number of samples) for just only one evaluation of the LOO criterion. In this paper, a novel and fast two stage algorithm is proposed for automatic construction of linear in parameter models for a class of nonlinear systems using LOO criterion, overcoming the disadvantages of stepwise model selection algorithms and reducing the computational complexity in applying the LOO criteria. Two numerical examples are presented to confirm its effectiveness."
