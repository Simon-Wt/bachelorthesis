1350433,14040,8500,A wireless magnetoresistive sensing system for an intra-oral tongue-computer interface,2012,"The Tongue Drive System (TDS) is a new minimally invasive, unobtrusive, wireless, and wearable tongue-operated assistive technology (AT) that enables individuals with severe physical disabilities to control environments with their free tongue motion. An array of magnetic sensors wirelessly tracks the position of a magnetic tracer attached to the tongue via adhesives or piercing, and a sensor signal-processing (SSP) algorithm converts a set of tongue gestures to user-defined commands in real time [1]. In the external TDS (eTDS), which is undergoing clinical trials, electronics are embedded in a customized headset, which supports the sensors on a pair of bilateral extensions near the cheeks [2]. Considering the importance of such ATs in users' daily lives, the mechanical stability of the eTDS on the head is a concern. In this paper we report an intraoral TDS (iTDS) that reliably fits inside a user's mouth in the form of a dental retainer to be well protected within the oral cavity."
1323329,14040,9099,Table talk enhancer: a tabletop system for enhancing and balancing mealtime conversations using utterance rates,2012,"The purpose of this research is to enhance mealtime communication by visualizing the utterance rates of individuals during meals. We developed a system called Table Talk Enhancer that visualizes mealtime communication by illuminating the dining table surface with three LED lights (red, green, and blue). The system records the voices of people sharing a meal using directional microphones fixed at the center of the table, and it calculates their utterance rate, which is the ratio of time spent on individual utterances to the total mealtime. The system changes the illumination patterns of the table surface based on the values of the in- dividual utterance rates and a balance of them. Each LED light shines brightly when people speak frequently, and each of the lights blinks synchronously when the utterance rates of the individual users have a proper balance. This illumination affects the conversation implicitly. For an evaluation, we installed our proposed system at a public location for five days. We did not teach the participants the meaning of the different illumination patterns. As a result, we found that although the participants did not know the specific meaning of the feedback, their utterance rates during meals increased more with the feedback than without it."
1621837,14040,65,Robot behavior designed to encourage conversations between visitors in an exhibition space,2014,"In this paper, we propose a novel way to encourage visitors to share their experiences and interests in exhibition spaces. To acquire information about the experiences of the visitors, we used a robot that inhabits the exhibition space. The robot acquires the visitor experience data and then shares this data with other visitors. We believe that this information (i.e., the experiences of previous visitors) will enhance the exhibition experience for subsequent visitors because the information may include interesting topics for the new visitors. However, there are some difficulties in communication between robots and humans. We used “PhotoChat”, which is an in-house photo communication software. PhotoChat is capable of communicating with others by taking photographs and adding annotations to each photograph. It also records the locations for coordination between the photographs and the statistical information contained in the annotations. We therefore used PhotoChat as the communication medium between the robot and the visitors. The robot acquires the visitor experiences and shares these experiences with other visitors through PhotoChat. The robot can also use bodily actions to express instructions to the visitors. We then developed a system that coordinates the photographs and their respective exhibition areas. We also implemented robot behavior (i.e., bodily actions and motions) that includes recommendations for photographs taken by others. We held workshops to perform data collection and manually classified the data into three content categories. We then performed experiments using the developed system to distribute the classified content. The results showed that the robot's behavior encouraged conversations between the visitors based on provided topics."
1516096,14040,9713,CALBA: capacity-aware location-based advertising in temporary social networks,2013,"A temporary social network (TSN) is confined to a specific place (e.g., hotel and shopping mall) or activity (e.g., concert and exhibition) in which the TSN service provider allows nearby third party vendors (e.g., restaurants and stores) to advertise their goods or services to its registered users. However, simply broadcasting all the vendors' advertisements to all the users in the TSN may cause the service provider to lose its fans. In this paper, we present Capacity-Aware Location-Based Advertising (CALBA), which is a framework designed for TSNs to select vendors as advertising sources for mobile users. In CALBA we measure the relevance of a vendor to a user by considering their geographical proximity and the user's preferences. Our goal is to maximize the overall relevance of selected vendors for a user with the constraint that the total advertising frequency of the selected vendors should not exceed the user's specified capacity. First, we model the snapshot selection problem as 0-1 knapsack and solve it using an approximation method. Then, CALBA keeps track of the selection result for moving users by employing a safe region technique that can reduce its computational cost. We also propose three pruning rules and a unique access order to effectively prune vendors which could not affect a safe region, in order to improve the efficiency of the client-side computation. We evaluate the performance of CALBA based on a real location-based social network data set crawled from Foursquare. Experimental results show that CALBA outperforms a naive approach which periodically invokes the snapshot vendor selection."
2268765,14040,30,Artifact Removal in Physiological Signals—Practices and Possibilities,2012,"The combination of reducing birth rate and increasing life expectancy continues to drive the demographic shift toward an aging population. This, in turn, places an ever-increasing burden on healthcare due to the increasing prevalence of patients with chronic illnesses and the reducing income-generating population base needed to sustain them. The need to urgently address this healthcare “time bomb” has accelerated the growth in ubiquitous, pervasive, distributed healthcare technologies. The current move from hospital-centric healthcare toward in-home health assessment is aimed at alleviating the burden on healthcare professionals, the health care system and caregivers. This shift will also further increase the comfort for the patient. Advances in signal acquisition, data storage and communication provide for the collection of reliable and useful in-home physiological data. Artifacts, arising from environmental, experimental and physiological factors, degrade signal quality and render the affected part of the signal useless. The magnitude and frequency of these artifacts significantly increases when data collection is moved from the clinic into the home. Signal processing advances have brought about significant improvement in artifact removal over the past few years. This paper reviews the physiological signals most likely to be recorded in the home, documenting the artifacts which occur most frequently and which have the largest degrading effect. A detailed analysis of current artifact removal techniques will then be presented. An evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the proposed artifact detection and removal techniques, with particular application to the personal healthcare domain, is provided."
1067250,14040,8806,Text entry using a foot for severely motor-impaired individuals,2014,"Some individuals affected by a motor neuron disease lose voluntary movement of the torso and arms, but keep for some time at least a partial movement of a leg and a foot. This work presents DuoGrapher, a text entry method, and SwingingFoot, an interaction technique, which aim to improve their communication skills by leveraging these motor capabilities. The idea is to attach in one of the user's feet an accelerometer-equipped device, which detect and transmit the movements to a second device located in front of the users' eyes. DuoGrapher interpreted the movements as characters according to the codification being used. Our design is informed by the motor capabilities of a male, in his 60s, with a motor neuron disease. We developed a prototype and tested it with 15 able-bodied users in order to test the usability of the system before doing further studies with motor-impaired individuals. Our goal is understand the challenges of a foot-based system interaction. It became evident that a semi-automatic calibration mechanism and a simpler mapping from movements to character are needed in order to reduce errors."
2224638,14040,9896,MyPosition: sparking civic discourse by a public interactive poll visualization,2014,"We present the design and evaluation of MyPosition, a public display in the form of a large projection, featuring an interactive poll visualization. MyPosition aims at facilitating the deliberation and comparison of individual opinions on locally relevant topics in an opportunistic and engaging way. We evaluated MyPosition in an in-the-wild study and demonstrated that the engaging nature of the installation was effective in enticing public discussion. We found that (i) the increased identifiability of users positively impacted the engagement with and the social debate around the installation, however lowered the actual polling rate; (ii) people submitted their personal opinion instead of playing around with the interactive features; and (iii) the display led to considerable discussion as well as nudging among people, in particular in zones beyond the interaction area in front of the screen."
2167543,14040,9896,Come meet me at Ulduar: progression raiding in world of warcraft,2012,"In spite of decades of research on virtual worlds, our understanding of one popular form of virtual world behavior - raiding - remains limited. Raiding is important because it entails intense, high-risk, and complex collaborative behaviors in computer-mediated environments. This paper contributes to CSCW literature by offering a longitudinal analysis of raiding behavior using system data manually collected from the game world itself, comparing two raiding teams as they worked through the same content. Supplemented with interviews and chat transcripts, this research sheds light on what actually happens during raids across four different temporal scales: seconds, hours, days, and months. It also distinguishes between behaviors that are imposed by the system design and those chosen by players. Finally, it derives two viable raiding styles from the data."
1991503,14040,9896,"Look ma, no email!: blogs and IRC as primary and preferred communication tools in a distributed firm",2011,"Email has been the primary communication medium in organizations for decades and despite studies that demonstrate its obvious disadvantages, the prevailing thinking is that email is irreplaceable. In this paper I challenge that view through a field study of a distributed firm that is highly successful in developing and delivering products without regular use of email in the workplace. Group blogging and IRC were the primary tools used and they allowed improved coordination and knowledge sharing compared to email. This paper contributes to scant literature in CSCW on firm-level technology use."
926395,14040,9078,A model-based approach for compound leaves understanding and identification,2013,"In this paper, we propose a specific method for the identification of compound-leaved tree species, with the aim of integrating it in an educational smartphone application. Our work is based on dedicated shape models for compound leaves, designed to estimate the number and shape of leaflets. A deformable template approach is used to fit these models and produce a high-level interpretation of the image content. The resulting models are later used for the segmentation of leaves in both plain and natural background images, by the use of multiple region-based active contours. Combined with other botany-inspired descriptors accounting for the morphological properties of the leaves, we propose a classification method that makes a semantic interpretation possible. Results are presented over a set of more than 1000 images from 17 European tree species, and an integration in the existing mobile application Folia 1  is considered."
842501,14040,9099,RealSense: directional interaction for proximate mobile sharing using built-in orientation sensors,2013,"We present RealSense, a technology that enables users to easily share media files with proximate users by performing directional gestures on mobile devices. RealSense leverages the natural human group behavior of forming a circle and facing the center of the group. By continuously monitoring the directional heading of each device using only built-in orientation sensors, RealSense can compute the relative direction between all the devices. It simplifies media sharing because users do not need to lookup and specify the user IDs and device IDs of the intended recipients. We first evaluated the feasibility and design of RealSense, including the orientation sensor error and the minimal arc degree for selecting recipients. We then compared RealSense with three other common sharing interactions: 1) linear menu, 2) pie menu, and 3) NFC. Our results show that participants preferred RealSense over other sharing interactions, especially for groups of participants who were unacquainted with each other."
936343,14040,65,Personalizable embodied telepresence system for remote interpersonal communication,2013,"Recent advances in human-robot interaction have enhanced the ability of robots to act as a mediator in remote communication. However, embodied expressive communication across distance is not supported by the current technology. Physical body is a powerful conduit for affective communication, and thus mediating properties of the physical body through an agent has been proposed to address this deficiency. In this paper, we offer heuristic justification on vision of embodied interfaces by adopting perspectives from social psychology in the context of mediated interpersonal communication. Based on our studies, we created a pair of robots named “Mini-Surrogate” as a personalized telecommunication medium which recreates and emulates the physical presence of a specific person. It applies the concepts of enclothed and embodied cognition to convey the illusion of a particular person's presence. Through minimal prototyping in terms of surrogate behaviors, we explored desired nonverbal cues by remotely located couples to satisfy their communication needs while being apart. Our exploratory study pointed to the acceptance of prototyped medium and showed that personalization could enhance communication affectivity in terms of providing awareness and reminding of the specific person. We realized the desired nonverbal cues that helped remote couples to perceive the interface as their remote partner. The findings contribute towards user experience, communication and robotic researchers to enhance the quality of telecommunication for remote couples."
2032738,14040,339,Trusted execution environments on mobile devices,2013,"A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a secure processing environment that is isolated from the normal processing environment where the device operating system and applications run. The first mobile phones with hardware-based TEEs appeared almost a decade ago, and today almost every smartphone and tablet contains a TEE like ARM TrustZone. Despite such a large-scale deployment, the use of TEE functionality has been limited for developers. With emerging standardization this situation is about to change. In this tutorial, we explain the security features provided by mobile TEEs and describe On-board Credentials (ObC) system that enables third-party TEE development. We discuss ongoing TEE standardization activities, including the recent Global Platform standards and the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 specification, and identify open problems for the near future of mobile hardware security."
2204079,14040,9896,Our life is the farm and farming is our life: home-work coordination in organic farm families,2014,"We present a qualitative study of 13 farm families who intentionally merge their home and work lives. This is in contrast to most families studied in CSCW, who are urban/ suburban, white-collar and often dual-income, where the goal is to balance separate home and work spheres. We analyze the farm families' coordination practices along three dimensions -- space, time, and roles -- and contrast their experiences to what is known in CSCW about family coordination practices. Through this, we reveal blind spots in CSCW's study of and support for family coordination toward building better tools to support such activities. We emphasize considering co-location rather than assuming geographic distribution across life spheres, the value of natural rhythms in understanding and supporting family life, and how taking on simultaneous roles can be viewed as a life goal rather than a source of conflict."
1989544,14040,9896,Learning from history: predicting reverted work at the word level in wikipedia,2012,"Wikipedia's remarkable success in aggregating millions of contributions can pose a challenge for current editors, whose hard work may be reverted unless they understand and follow established norms, policies, and decisions and avoid contentious or proscribed terms. We present a machine learning model for predicting whether a contribution will be reverted based on word level features. Unlike previous models relying on editor-level characteristics, our model can make accurate predictions based only on the words a contribution changes. A key advantage of the model is that it can provide feedback on not only whether a contribution is likely to be rejected, but also the particular words that are likely to be controversial, enabling new forms of intelligent interfaces and visualizations. We examine the performance of the model across a variety of Wikipedia articles."
2322527,14040,9896,Shared geocaching over distance with mobile video streaming,2014,"Shared geocaching is an outdoor activity where pairs of individuals geocache together but in different locations. Video streaming allows two players to see each remote person's view and converse during the activity. This allows players to help each other out while searching for geocaches. We envision that shared geocaching will provide a way for family or friends to share experiences together over distance where they are both participating in the same activity at the same time, only in different locations."
1974946,14040,9896,PRIMIExperience: experience sampling via instant messaging,2011,"In this paper we present the PRIMIExperience system, proposing the use of instant messaging as a mean for carrying out cost-effective Experience Sampling studies with a minimised setup effort."
1715823,14040,9896,Affording Mechanisms: An Integrated View of Coordination and Knowledge Management,2012,"In this paper we question the separation between technologies that support information and handle the ordered flow of work and technologies that support knowledge management. On the basis of observational studies and initiatives of participatory prototype design that we performed in the hospital domain and other cooperative work settings, the paper proposes a unified view of these high-level functionalities through the notion of Affording Mechanism. In order to clarify the implications for design, the paper discusses the relationships between knowledge and representations; the role of artifacts that are used in activities where knowledge is allegedly produced, shared and consumed; and finally the notion of affordance and its dynamics. In very general terms, an AM consists of an artifact and of dynamic relationships between the context of use and the artifact's affordances, expressed in terms of simple if-then constructs. The affordances conveyed through and by the artifact are modulated in order to evoke a positive reaction in the actors who use these augmented artifacts and to support knowledgeable behaviors apt to the situation. Moreover, the paper illustrates a prototypical technology through examples derived from the studies mentioned above, and discusses the kind of support this application provides in the light of an unusual interpretation of what it might mean to manage knowledge through computer-based technology."
2547310,14040,9896,A pen-based toolkit for authoring collaborative language activities,2012,"Hybrid paper-digital interfaces enabled by digital pens are a promising approach for supporting collaborative language, communication, and socialization activities. Digital pens enhance interaction with traditional paper content by playing and recording audio and recognizing handwriting and gestures. Currently, generating custom interactive paper documents involves some programming, limiting its use by many user groups (e.g., educators and families) who might especially benefit from application of hybrid paper-digital interfaces in their practices. To address this need, we developed an end-user Toolkit for Authoring Pen and Paper Language Activities (TAP & PLAY). End-users are able to quickly create custom interactive materials to support collocated interaction between children, teachers, and family members."
2228200,14040,9896,Gracoli: a graphical command line user interface,2013,"Command Line Interface (CLI) is the most popular and basic user interface to interact with computers. Despite its simplicity, it has some limitations in terms of user experience. For example, sometimes it is hard to understand and interpret the textual output of the command. In this paper we describe the limitations of command line interfaces and propose Gracoli 1 : A graphical command line interface that takes advantage of both text-based interface and graphical user interface to provide better user experience and perform complex tasks. We demonstrate some of the useful applications and features of Gracoli. Sometime such a hybrid system provides and combines the strengths of CLI and GUI to perform specific tasks. We explore some useful applications of Gracoli to create a new kind of user experience. Command line interface makes accessibility faster and Graphical User-Interface makes output more interactive and understandable."
2348852,14040,9896,"The policy knot: re-integrating policy, practice and design in cscw studies of social computing",2014,"In CSCW and information science research today, the worlds of design, practice, and policy are often held separate, speaking to different audiences, venues, and fields of expertise. But many growing areas of CSCW work, including mobile, cloud, and social computing, run into problems precisely at this intersection. This paper presents a model for understanding processes of change and emergence in social computing in which policy, practice, and design show up in the form of complex interdependencies, or knots, that collectively determine the shape, meaning, and trajectory of shifting computational forms. We then apply this model to two recent social computing controversies: the 2011 privacy scandal surrounding the location-aware mobile app Girls Around Me; and controversies surrounding the 2010 launch of the Google Buzz social network. We argue that better attention to the mutually constitutive relations between design, practice and policy can expand the reach, depth, and impact of CSCW scholarship."
2403632,14040,9896,The personality of popular facebook users,2012,"We study the relationship between Facebook popularity (number of contacts) and personality traits on a large number of subjects. We test to which extent two prevalent viewpoints hold. That is, popular users (those with many social contacts) are the ones whose personality traits  either  predict many offline (real world) friends  or  predict propensity to maintain superficial relationships. We find that the predictor for number of friends in the real world (Extraversion) is also a predictor for number of Facebook contacts. We then test whether people who have many social contacts on Facebook are the ones who are able to adapt themselves to new forms of communication, present themselves in likable ways, and have propensity to maintain superficial relationships. We show that there is no statistical evidence to support such a conjecture."
1416264,14040,8806,Combination: automated generation of puzzles with constraints,2011,"Constraint Programming offers a powerful means of solving a wide variety of combinatorial problems. We have used this powerful paradigm to create a successful computer game called Combination. Combination is an application for the iPhone and iPod touch. It has been on sale internationally through the iTunes store since December, 2008 and received a number of positive reviews.   In this paper we explain how all the levels of Combination were generated, checked for correctness and rated for difficulty completely automatically through the use of constraints. We go on to evaluate this method of creation with the use of a human evaluation. This showed that fun, immersing computer games can be created with constraint programming."
1276994,14040,422,Topic-factorized ideal point estimation model for legislative voting network,2014,"Ideal point estimation that estimates legislators' ideological positions and understands their voting behavior has attracted studies from political science and computer science. Typically, a legislator is assigned a global ideal point based on her voting or other social behavior. However, it is quite normal that people may have different positions on different policy dimensions. For example, some people may be more liberal on economic issues while more conservative on cultural issues. In this paper, we propose a novel topic-factorized ideal point estimation model for a legislative voting network in a unified framework. First, we model the ideal points of legislators and bills for each topic instead of assigning them to a global one. Second, the generation of topics are guided by the voting matrix in addition to the text information contained in bills. A unified model that combines voting behavior modeling and topic modeling is presented, and an iterative learning algorithm is proposed to learn the topics of bills as well as the topic-factorized ideal points of legislators and bills. By comparing with the state-of-the-art ideal point estimation models, our method has a much better explanation power in terms of held-out log-likelihood and other measures. Besides, case studies show that the topic-factorized ideal points coincide with human intuition. Finally, we illustrate how to use these topic-factorized ideal points to predict voting results for unseen bills."
2349922,14040,9896,Building a standpoints web to support decision-making in wikipedia,2012,"Although the Web enables large-scale collaboration, its potential to support group decision-making has not been fully exploited. My research aims to analyze, extract, and represent disagreement in purposeful social web conversations. This supports decision-making in distributed groups by representing individuals' claims and their justifications in a Standpoints Web, a hypertext web interlinking the claims and justifications made throughout the social web. The two main contributions of my dissertation are an architecture for the Standpoints Web and a case study implementing the Standpoints Web for Wikipedia's deletion discussions."
1141363,14040,9099,MSVA: Musical Street View Animator: An Effective and Efficient Way to Enjoy the Street Views of Your Journey,2014,"Google Maps with Street View (GSV) provides ways to explore the world but it lacks efficient ways to present a journey. Hyperlapse provides another ways for quick glimpsing the street-views along the route; however, its viewing experience is also not comfortable and could be tedious when the route is long-distance. In this paper, we provide an efficient and enjoyable way to present street view sequences of long journey. Street view journey video accompanied with locally listened music will be produced by the proposed approach. During the move between locations, we use the speed control techniques for animation production to improve the viewing experience. User evaluation results show that the proposed method increases the satisfaction of users in viewing the street view sequences."
2239440,14040,369,Predictive-TDMA: A Markov Chain Based MAC Protocol for Mesh Networks,2011,"One of the most frequently concerned metrics for evaluating the performance of MAC protocol is throughput. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Chain based TDMA MAC protocol which is called Predictive-TDMA (P-TDMA) to achieve high performance of throughput for Mesh Networks. In order to give a more effective time slot assignment strategy rather than even assignment, we use Markov Chain to predict the possibility of an end-user device's future working condition, whether it's more likely to be idle or busy. Then based on the ratio of all end-user devices' possibilities of working condition, we assign a proper number of time slots to each end-user device to maximize throughput. Through simulation, the results show that under the scenario that the amount of data is randomly requested by each end-user device, throughput of our design is around 10% better than even assignment strategy. And under the scenario that some end-user devices request much more amount of data than others, which happens more frequently in realistic situations, throughput of our design can be 200% better than even assignment strategy."
1766175,14040,9896,Learning from marginalized users: reciprocity in HCI4D,2012,"Users in the developing world continue to appropriate information and communication technologies (ICTs) in pioneering ways resulting in innovations such as M-Pesa, the popular mobile money transfer system developed in Kenya. M-Pesa's success demonstrates the emergence of user-centered innovative applications in resource-constrained settings. The goals of our workshop are twofold: 1) to uncover more of these examples and 2) to discuss how they can influence design in developed countries."
2022344,14040,9099,Through the looking glass: mirror worlds for augmented awareness & capability,2012,"We demonstrate a system for supporting mirror worlds - 3D virtual models of physical spaces that reflect the structure and activities of those spaces to help support context awareness and tasks such as planning and recollection of events. Through views on web pages, portable devices, or on `magic window' displays in the physical space, remote people may `look in' to the space, while people within the space are provided information that would not otherwise be obvious. For example, by looking at a mirror display, people can learn how long others have been present, or where they have been. People in one part of a building can get a sense of activities in the rest of the building. The system can be used to bridge across sites and help provide different parts of an organization with a shared awareness of each other's activities. We demonstrate viewers for several mirror worlds we have created, including for the ACM conference venue in Nara."
2162523,14040,9896,Using physical signaling to support collaborative mobile search,2014,"Often when people search the web from their phones, they do so collaboratively. We present a mobile application that supports in-person collaborative search by allowing users to physically signal a willingness to share. While the core application provides standard mobile search functionality, users rotate their devices to landscape orientation to indicate (to the device and others) they are entering a collaborative mode. We study two uses of collaborative mode, one where users rate results to create a group list, and another where screens and actions are shared across devices."
845228,14040,9099,MixPad: augmenting interactive paper with mice & keyboards for cross-media and fine-grained interaction with documents,2012,"Existing interactive paper systems suffer from the disparate input devices for paper and computers. The finger-pen-only input on paper causes frequent devices switching (e.g. pen vs. mouse) during cross-media interactions, and may have issues of occlusion and precision. We propose MixPad, a novel interactive paper system, which allows users to exploit mice and keyboards to digitally manipulate fine-grained document content on paper, such as copying an arbitrary image region to a computer and clicking on a word for web search. With the combined input channels, MixPad enables richer digital functions on paper and facilitates bimanual operations cross different media. A preliminary user study shows positive feedback on this interaction technique."

1027381,14040,9099,Modeling the Interest-Forgetting Curve for Music Recommendation,2014,"Music recommendation plays a key role in our daily lives as well as in the multimedia industry. This paper adapts the memory forgetting curve to model the human  interest-forgetting  curve for music recommendations based on the observation of recency effects in people's listening to music. Two music recommendation methods are proposed using this model with respect to the sequence-based and the IFC-based transition probabilities, respectively. We also bring forward a learning method to approximate the global optimal or personalized interest-forgetting speed(s). The experimental results show that our methods can significantly improve the accuracy in music recommendations. Meanwhile, the IFC-based method outperforms the sequence-based method when recommendation list is short at each time."
305085,14040,9616,Efficient and robust image descriptor for GUI object classification,2012,"Graphical User Interface (GUI) object classification is essential for image-based software automation tools. The challenges posed by GUI object classification are significantly different from those in natural image classification. In this paper we present a novel image descriptor developed specifically for GUI objects; it is robust to various changes in the appearance of GUI objects, such as various screen resolution, ”skin”, as well as various operating system related. We use this image descriptor with Support Vector Machine classifier, and experimentally show the descriptor robustness to the above transformations, and its superior performance compared to existing image descriptors."
2646321,14040,422,Hybrid recommendation models for binary user preference prediction problem,2011,"This paper presents detailed information of our solutions to the task 2 of KDD Cup 2011. The task 2 is called binary user preference prediction problem in the paper because it aims at separating tracks rated highly by specific users from tracks not rated by them, and the solutions of this task can be easily applied to binary user behavior data. In the contest, we firstly implemented many different models, including neighborhood-based models, latent factor models, content-based models, etc. Then, linear combination is used to combine different models together. Finally, we used robust post-processing to further refine the special user-item pairs. The final error rate is 2.4808% which placed number 2 in the Leaderboard."

1783793,14040,9713,Location recommendation based on location history and spatio-temporal correlations for an on-demand bus system,2011,"An on-demand bus is like a shared taxi that operates only when riders want to travel between the origin and destination locations. It offers many advantages over fixed-route buses, but the riders are bothered by the need to tediously enter such data as origins, destinations, and deadlines. A location recommendation system that predicts such data would help riders during the reservation process and help target potential riders when buses are idle. In this paper, a general and scalable framework for such location recommendation algorithms is presented. It is based on users' location histories and spatio-temporal correlations among the locations by combining prediction methods of the collaborative filtering algorithms, which are widely used in e-commerce, with a popular method in data mining called  link propagation . Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the accuracy of recommendations with the spatio-temporal information is better than those without."
2440717,14040,422,Cost-aware travel tour recommendation,2011,"Advances in tourism economics have enabled us to collect massive amounts of travel tour data. If properly analyzed, this data can be a source of rich intelligence for providing real-time decision making and for the provision of travel tour recommendations. However, tour recommendation is quite different from traditional recommendations, because the tourist's choice is directly affected by the travel cost, which includes the financial cost and the time. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of cost-aware tour recommendation. Along this line, we develop two cost-aware latent factor models to recommend travel packages by considering both the travel cost and the tourist's interests. Specifically, we first design a cPMF model, which models the tourist's cost with a 2-dimensional vector. Also, in this cPMF model, the tourist's interests and the travel cost are learnt by exploring travel tour data. Furthermore, in order to model the uncertainty in the travel cost, we further introduce a Gaussian prior into the cPMF model and develop the GcPMF model, where the Gaussian prior is used to express the uncertainty of the travel cost. Finally, experiments on real-world travel tour data show that the cost-aware recommendation models outperform state-of-the-art latent factor models with a significant margin. Also, the GcPMF model with the Gaussian prior can better capture the impact of the uncertainty of the travel cost, and thus performs better than the cPMF model."
2169413,14040,9896,Recalibrating the ratio: enacting accountability in intimate relationships using shared calendars,2013,"This study enriches the understanding of relationship work in the context of calendar sharing by examining how people negotiate and enact accountability in their intimate relationships with and around their shared calendars. We conducted 13 semi-structured interviews as part of a qualitative study of Google Calendar users. Our research discovered how participants develop understandings of how close friends and significant others structure their time using shared calendars, as well as how people negotiate and enact accounts within and beyond their intimate relationships. Our findings indicate ways in which Online Calendar Systems (OCS) can be better designed to more effectively support users' needs."
746317,14040,369,A Handoff Decision Algorithm in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks with Parallel Transmission Capability,2011,"To provide the seamless mobility in heterogeneous wireless networks, the handoff decision strategy is regarded as a significant and challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a handoff decision algorithm with the parallel transmission characteristic of the mobile multimode terminal in heterogeneous wireless networks. In our algorithm, the model of Markov decision process is used to determine the optimal handoff policy in order to maximize the expected total reward during the transmission. Simulation results show that compared to some existing handoff decision algorithms, the proposed algorithm outperforms in terms of the expected total reward, the expected number of handoffs and the probability of connection dropping."

109072,14040,21989,A Study on the Prototype of Focusing on the Operability for Requirement Acquisition,2013,"The purpose of this study is to propose the effective usage of the prototype of focusing on operability. As a result, participants indicated the design aspects and operability aspects when using the High-fidelity prototype more than Medium and Low-fidelity prototype. Also, participants indicated the function aspects when evaluating the Low-fidelity prototype more than High and Medium-fidelity prototype. The results suggested that a High-fidelity prototype is suitable for evaluating design aspects and operative aspects. In this study, the effective usage of prototype was proposed based on the experiments. It is possible to decrease the additional demand in the later phase of the project."

This research looks at how team's creativity is influenced by the degree of team's knowledge sourcing and by the learning orientation of the team. This empirical study was conducted by gathering data from 148 graduate students working in teams on an e-commerce project. The research model was tested using PLSPM. The findings show the significant influence of both independent variables.
829797,14040,9896,A monkey and a stick figure: stories of remixing and social creativity,2012,"In this video, we illustrate the process and possibilities of social creativity in a large online community of young creators. We present two real stories of how a social computing system facilitated the remixing of a video game and an animation. We position these stories in the context of the online community where they occurred and explore how these case studies help us better understand social phenomena such as meme-spreads on the Internet, and the design of social computing systems."

1242874,14040,20854,The multiple layers of materiality,2014,"This is a work-in-progress, in which we theoretically reflect on notions of materiality from Interaction Design research and the scientific field of textual studies to discuss what it means to work with digital materials, and what their materiality is. We found that several notions entail a layered concept of materiality. We will discuss the ontological immateriality of the digital and the phenomenological materiality that emerges through interaction. Thus, design is necessarily engaged with combining materials and experiencing the materialities that emerge from the interactive artifact."

1282639,14040,20561,Using Incentive Systems to Increase Information Quality in Business Intelligence: A Quasi-Experiment in the Financial Services Industry,2013,"We present an alignment model of Business Intelligence and incentive systems with the aim to increase the information quality. We propose two hypotheses: An aligned incentive system leads to higher quality of information. However, information quality that is not subject to incentives will decrease after the introduction of such an incentive scheme. This can be explained by a crowding-out effect of previous intrinsic motivated behavior. These hypotheses are tested with a quasi-experiment in the financial services industry."

Using a controlled research setting involving the use of an ERP system, our results show that not all knowledge management processes are beneficial for team performance, and that the variability within the level of team arousal moderates the relationship between knowledge management processes and team performance. This paper has implications in research on business process management, knowledge management, and electronic collaboration."
1526746,14040,11317,E-Block: a tangible programming tool for children,2012,E-Block is a tangible programming tool for children aged 5 to 9 which gives children a preliminary understanding of programming. Children can write programs to play a maze game by placing the programming blocks in E-Block. The two stages in a general programming process: programming and running are all embodied in E-Block. We realized E-Block by wireless and infrared technology and gave it feedbacks on both screen and programming blocks. The result of a preliminary user study proved that E-Block is attractive to children and easy to learn and use.

The diversity of resolution and spatial properties of these facades hasn't stopped content creators to adapt their projects to multiple media facades with significant different resolution, shapes, surroundings and social environment. \ In this paper we introduce Puzzle Facade as an example of an urban technological intervention that has a strong connection with the spatial properties of the media facade it was conceived for, the media facade of the Ars Electronica Center."
2266937,14040,9896,Setting the stage for interaction: a tablet application to augment group discussion in a seminar class,2012,"We present a tablet-based system to collaboratively track discussion topics and ideas in a seminar-style discussion classroom. Each student uses his or her own tablet to share text ideas in a synchronized, visual environment. The system is designed to promote diverse participation and increase engagement. Our findings are based on observations of twelve class sessions and interviews with participating students. Instead of simply introducing an additional text-based communication channel into the classroom, we find that the system creates a new stage (in the Goffman sense) on which students could perform in ways that the main spoken stage could not support. This stage coexists with spoken communication, and augments how students attend to the material and each other. We conclude that spoken participation alone poses barriers for some participants and the addition of a non-oral, text-based stage can help establish equitable and engaging discussions in the class."
1751754,14040,9896,TalkBetter: family-driven mobile intervention care for children with language delay,2014,"Language delay is a developmental problem of children who do not acquire language as expected for their chronological ages. Without timely intervention, language delay can act as a lifelong risk factor. Speech-language pathologists highlight that effective parent participation in everyday parent-child conversation is important to treat children's language delay. For effective roles, however, parents need to alter their own lifelong-established conversation habits, requiring extensive period of conscious effort and staying alert. In this paper, we present new opportunities for mobile and social computing to reinforce everyday parent-child conversation with therapeutic implications for children with language delays. Specifically, we propose TalkBetter, a mobile in-situ intervention service to help parents in daily parent-child conversation through real-time meta-linguistic analysis of ongoing conversations. Through extensive field studies with speech-language pathologists and parents, we report the multilateral motivations and implications of TalkBetter. We present our development of TalkBetter prototype and report its performance evaluation."
269273,14040,8231,Mining Usage Traces of Mobile Apps for Dynamic Preference Prediction,2013,"Due to a huge amount of mobile applications (abbreviated as Apps), for Apps providers, the usage preferences of Apps are impor- tant in recommending Apps, downloading Apps and promoting Apps. We predict and quantize users' dynamic preferences by exploring their usage traces of Apps. To address the dynamic preference prediction problem, we propose Mode-based Prediction (abbreviated as MBP) and Reference- based Prediction (abbreviated as RBP) algorithms. Both MBP and RBP consist of two phases: the trend detection phase and the change esti- mation phase. In the trend detection phase, both algorithms determine whether the preference of an App is increasing or decreasing. Then, in the change estimation phase, the amount of preference change is calculated. In particular, MBP adopts users' current usage mode (active or inactive), and then estimates the amount of change via our proposed utility model. On the other hand, RBP calculates an expected number of usage as a reference, and then builds a probabilistic model to estimate the change of preference by comparing the real usage and the reference. We conduct comprehensive experiments using two App usage traces and one music listening log, the Last.fm dataset, to validate our proposed algorithms. The experimental results show that both MBP and RBP outperform the usage-based method that is based solely on the number of usages."
844876,14040,65,Do robot appearance and speech affect people's attitude? Evaluation through the Ultimatum Game,2012,"In this study, we examine the factors with which robots are recognized as social beings. Participants joined sessions of the Ultimatum Game, a procedure commonly used for examining attitudes toward others in the fields of economics and social psychology. Several agents differing in their appearances are tested with speech stimuli that are expected to induce a mentalizing effect toward the agents. As a result, we found that while appearance itself did not show significant difference in the attitudes, the mentalizing stimuli affected the attitudes in different ways depending on robots' appearances. This results showed that such elements as simple conversation with the agents and their appearance are important factors so that robots are treated more humanlike and as social beings."
1401726,14040,9099,Yu bi yomu: interactive reading of dynamic text,2012,"In this paper, we propose novel software to read text documents with tablet PCs and describe its installation plan. The software, Yu bi Yomu, was developed as an iOS application, supposing to work on the Apple iPad. In that software, the contrast of displayed texts is changed dynamically in response to users' trailing behavior. In the installation, we will project the displays of tablet PCs operating Yu bi Yomu onto large screens attached to the wall or floor. The installation using this novel software provides new reading experiences."
1854231,14040,9896,The value of data: considering the context of production in data economies,2011,"In this paper we argue that how scientific collaborations share data is bound up in the ways in which they produce and acquire that data. We draw on ethnographic work with two robotic space exploration teams to show how each community's norms of data-sharing are best understood as arising not from the context of the use or exchange of data, but from the context of data production. Shifting our perspective back to the point of production suggests that digital artifacts are embedded in a broader data economy. We present implications for analysis of data in interactional context, and for introducing systems or policies that conflict with the value of data in its context of production."
2517476,14040,9896,A case study of non-adoption: the values of location tracking in the family,2012,"A number of commercial location tracking systems exist which enable parents to monitor where their children are when outdoors. The adoption of these services and whether, through their design, they reflect parental values has not been investigated. This question was pursued with a large-scale survey of 920 parents from the UK. The use of location tracking was not prevalent amongst parents and only a minority had considered using these technologies. Parents favoring location tracking described it in the context of security, peace of mind and the need to reduce uncertainty. Parents who were against location tracking described a general lack of need as they had established reliable mechanisms for security and valued trust in the family as well as children's self-direction. Our findings show that location tracking concurrently  supports  and  threatens  parental values. By focusing on the values it undermines, we are able to suggest new directions for location systems."
2621095,14040,9463,Embracing Ambiguity: A Comparison of Annotation Methodologies for Crowdsourcing Word Sense Labels,2013,"Word sense disambiguation aims to identify which meaning of a word is present in a given usage. Gathering word sense annotations is a laborious and difficult task. Several methods have been proposed to gather sense annotations using large numbers of untrained annotators, with mixed results. We propose three new annotation methodologies for gathering word senses where untrained annotators are allowed to use multiple labels and weight the senses. Our findings show that given the appropriate annotation task, untrained workers can obtain at least as high agreement as annotators in a controlled setting, and in aggregate generate equally as good of a sense labeling."
2263340,14040,9896,Towards a questionnaire for measuring affective benefits and costs of communication technologies,2014,"As CSCW creates and investigates technologies for social communication, it is important to understand the emotional benefits and costs of these systems. We propose the Affec-tive Benefits and Costs of Communication Technologies (ABCCT) questionnaire to supplement traditional qualita-tive methods of understanding communication media. We discuss the pilots of this survey with 45 children and 110 adults measuring the inter-item reliability of this instru-ment. We present the results of interviews with 14 children and 14 adults, which help confirm that the ABCCT measures the same constructs that may emerge through interview investigations. Finally, we demonstrate that the ABCCT is sensitive enough to discriminate between differ-ent communication technologies and has shown promise in some of its early adoption. Though the ABCCT is not with-out limitations, it may provide a way to compare technolo-gies in field deployments, draw findings across investiga-tions, and quantify the impact of specific design decisions."
1009411,14040,9099,Collaborative Recommendation of Photo-Taking Geolocations,2014,"We apply collaborative recommendation algorithms to photography in order to produce personalized suggestions for locations in the geocoordinate space where mobile users can take photos. We base our work on a collection of 3 million geotagged, publicly-available Flickr.com digital photos on which we applied a series of steps: first, unique locations are identified by discretizing the continuous latitude and longitude geocoordinates into geographic virtual bins; second, implicit feedback is calculated in a user x location matrix using normalized frequency; and third, missing feedback values are imputed through four different algorithms (one memory-based and three model-based). Our results show that two of the model-based algorithms produced the best RMSE and that the RMSE is sensitive to increasing hash bin size."
2410882,14040,9896,DrumGenius: bridging learning-gap with interactive musical instruments,2014,"When independent learning is conducted in musical instruments learning, the learning process can be easily interrupted due to expectation gap between children and parents. Traditional acoustic musical instruments are challenging for young children because they require high levels of coordination and precision. We found that children learnt rhythm and cadence through physical activity in the early music learning by instinct. DrumGenius, as a new controller for interactive musical games, was designed to combine exploration and play by providing real-time dynamic feedback depending on children's movements in the learning process. The study aims to bridge the gap by a dynamic learning pattern in initial learning stage with respect to the existing static way."
2470737,14040,9896,Mutual assessment in the social programmer ecosystem: an empirical investigation of developer profile aggregators,2013,"The multitude of social media channels that programmers can use to participate in software development has given rise to online developer profiles that aggregate activity across many services. Studying members of such developer profile aggregators, we found an ecosystem that revolves around the  social programmer . Developers are assessing each other to evaluate whether other developers are interesting, worth following, or worth collaborating with. They are self-conscious about being assessed, and thus manage their public images. They value passion for software development, new technologies, and learning. Some recruiters participate in the ecosystem and use it to find candidates for hiring; other recruiters struggle with the interpretation of signals and issues of trust. This mutual assessment is changing how software engineers collaborate and how they advance their skills."
2018696,14040,9713,Probabilistic sequential POIs recommendation via check-in data,2012,"While on the go, people are using their phones as a personal concierge discovering what is around and deciding what to do. Mobile phone has become a recommendation terminal customized for individuals. While existing research predominantly focuses on one-step recommendation---recommending the next single activity according to current context, this work moves one step beyond by recommending a series of activities, which is a package of sequential Points of Interest (POIs). The recommended POIs are not only  relevant  to user context (i.e., current location, time, and check-in), but also  personalized  to his/her check-in history. We presents a probabilistic approach, which is highly motivated from a large-scale commercial mobile check-in data analysis, to ranking a list of sequential POI categories (e.g., Japanese food and bar) and POIs (e.g., I love sushi). The approach enables users to plan consecutive activities on the move. Specifically, the probabilistic recommendation approach estimates the transition probability from one POI to another, conditioned on current context and check-in history in a Markov chain. To alleviate the discritization error and sparsity problem, we further introduce context collaboration and integrate prior information. Experiments on over 100k real-world check-in records and 20 k  POIs validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
1407692,14040,9099,Co-Saliency Detection via Base Reconstruction,2014,"Co-saliency aims at detecting common saliency in a series of images, which is useful for a variety of multimedia applications. In this paper, we address the co-saliency detection to a reconstruction problem: the foreground could be well reconstructed by using the reconstruction bases, which are extracted from each image and have the similar appearances in the feature space. We firstly obtain a candidate set by measuring the saliency prior of each image. Relevance information among the multiple images is utilized to remove the inaccuracy reconstruction bases. Finally, with the updated reconstruction bases, we rebuild the images and provide the reconstruction error regarded as a negative correlational value in co-saliency measurement. The satisfactory quantitative and qualitative experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method."
1794866,14040,9475,Cascade mitigation in energy hub networks,2011,"The paper establishes a formulation for energy hub networks that is consistent with mixed-integer quadratic programming problems. Line outages and cascading failures can be considered within this framework. Power flows across transmission lines and pipelines are compared with flow bounds, and tripped when violations occur. The outaging of lines is achieved using a mixed-integer disjunctive model. A model predictive control (MPC) strategy is developed to mitigate cascading failures, and prevent propagation of outages from one energy-carrier network to another. The MPC strategy seeks to alleviate overloads by adjusting generation and storage schedules, subject to ramp-rate limits and governor action. If overloads cannot be eliminated by rescheduling alone, MPC determines the minimum amount of load that must be shed to restore system integrity. The MPC strategy is illustrated using a small 12 hub network and a much larger network that includes 132 energy hubs."
2421002,14040,9896,GeoTagger: a collaborative and participatory environmental inquiry system,2014,"This note focuses on the motivation, approach, and the initial prototype implementation of Geotagger: a collaborative participatory environmental inquiry system. We situate the need for such a technology, and discuss related work -- much of which is situated in the realm of citizen science. Our work uniquely distinguishes itself from many other citizen science applications in that it supports limited data collection and analysis, with the additional benefit of supporting social interactions and engagement through conversations about observed data. This is accomplished by creating friends and groups which are collaborators in the observational inquiry process."
1264534,14040,8494,Fast and improved seam carving with strip partition and neighboring probability constraints,2013,"Seam carving is an effective way of image retargeting. However, existing seam carving schemes often come with unacceptable artifacts and are quite time consuming. In this paper, we propose a fast seam carving scheme with strip partition and neighboring probability constraints to resolve these two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we split the original image into several strips of equal space and we estimate the importance of each strip by its average saliency values. This partition results that more seams are removed from the strips consisting of more unimportant regions while fewer seams are removed from that of more important regions. Then, we establish the adjacency relationship by maximum correlation [8]. The neighboring probability is obtained to describe the neighboring relationship between the seams. Finally, by combining the neighboring probability and their accumulated energy, least important seams are removed. The neighboring probability constraint ensures that the seam removal is distributed to avoid abrupt changes in the scene. This leads to an improved quality in the resized image. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs better than the state-of-the-art seam carving schemes."
2538959,14040,9896,Who’s Got the Data? Interdependencies in Science and Technology Collaborations,2012,"Science and technology always have been interdependent, but never more so than with today’s highly instrumented data collection practices. We report on a long-term study of collaboration between environmental scientists (biology, ecology, marine sciences), computer scientists, and engineering research teams as part of a five-university distributed science and technology research center devoted to embedded networked sensing. The science and technology teams go into the field with mutual interests in gathering scientific data. “Data” are constituted very differently between the research teams. What are data to the science teams may be context to the technology teams, and vice versa. Interdependencies between the teams determine the ability to collect, use, and manage data in both the short and long terms. Four types of data were identified, which are managed separately, limiting both reusability of data and replication of research. Decisions on what data to curate, for whom, for what purposes, and for how long, should consider the interdependencies between scientific and technical processes, the complexities of data collection, and the disposition of the resulting data.

2285861,14040,9896,"Twitter ain't without frontiers: economic, social, and cultural boundaries in international communication",2014,"With the advent of Twitter and other lightweight social-networking services, one might think that it is easier than ever to maintain geographically dispersed, weaker social ties. By contrast, in this study we show that the international Twitter communication landscape is not only still largely predetermined by physical distance, but that it also depends on countries' social, economic, and cultural attributes. We describe a study of an international Twitter mention network of 13 million users across over 100 countries. We show that the  Gravity Model , which hypothesizes that the flow between two areas is proportional to their masses (which we approximate using internet penetration) and inversely proportional to the distance between them, is correlated ( r =0.68) with the international communication flow. Using this model, along with other social, economic, and cultural variables, we predict the communication volume at  Adjusted R 2   of $0.80$, with trade, language and racial intolerance especially impacting communication. We discuss the implications of these barriers to communication in the contexts of collaborative work, software design, and recommendation systems."
1791536,14040,9896,Do editors or articles drive collaboration?: multilevel statistical network analysis of wikipedia coauthorship,2012,"Prior scholarship on Wikipedia's collaboration processes has examined the properties of either editors or articles, but not the interactions between both. We analyze the coauthorship network of Wikipedia articles about breaking news demanding intense coordination and compare the properties of these articles and the editors who contribute to them to articles about contemporary and historical events. Using p*/ERGM methods to test a multi-level, multi-theoretical model, we identify how editors' attributes and editing patterns interact with articles' attributes and authorship history. Editors' attributes like prior experience have a stronger influence on collaboration patterns, but article attributes also play significant roles. Finally, we discuss the implications our findings and methods have for understanding the socio-material duality of collective intelligence systems beyond Wikipedia."
920698,14040,422,Playlist prediction via metric embedding,2012,"Digital storage of personal music collections and cloud-based music services (e.g. Pandora, Spotify) have fundamentally changed how music is consumed. In particular, automatically generated playlists have become an important mode of accessing large music collections. The key goal of automated playlist generation is to provide the user with a  coherent  listening experience. In this paper, we present Latent Markov Embedding (LME), a machine learning algorithm for generating such playlists. In analogy to matrix factorization methods for collaborative filtering, the algorithm does not require songs to be described by features a priori, but it learns a representation from example playlists. We formulate this problem as a regularized maximum-likelihood embedding of Markov chains in Euclidian space, and show how the resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently. An empirical evaluation shows that the LME is substantially more accurate than adaptations of smoothed n-gram models commonly used in natural language processing."
1032886,14040,9099,An approach to automatic creation of cinemagraphs,2012,"A cinemagraph is a new type of medium that infuses a static image with the dynamics of one particular region. It is in many ways intermediate between a photograph and a video, and has a number of attractive potential applications, such as the creation of dynamic scenes for games and interactive environments. However, creating cinemagraphs is time consuming and requires certain level of proficiency on photo editing techniques. In this paper, we present a fully automatic approach that creates cinemagraphs from video sequences. Specifically, we view cinemagraph construction as a constrained optimization problem that seeks a sub-volume in video with the maximum cumulative flow fields. The problem can be efficiently solved by a branch and-bound search scheme. A user survey is conducted to understand user preferences and demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. The findings of this study should provide information for various design choices for an easy and versatile authoring tool for cinemagraphs."
2350923,14040,9896,Global software development in a CSCW perspective,2014,"Global software development (GSD) has been an im-portant research topic in the CSCW community for more than two decades. CSCW has helped identify a significant number of challenges and solutions for han-dling distances in time, space and culture in distributed software engineering environments. However, no com-prehensive collected body of knowledge concerning research on GSD from a CSCW perspective exists yet. The goal of this workshop is to bring together research-ers and practitioners who have studied GSD from a CSCW perspective, and provide an overview of current findings and future challenges. In the workshop, we will facilitate group discussions across the diverse groups of researchers coming from ethnographic studies of soft-ware development practices and design studies of CSCW tools and processes for GSD. The goal is to pro-vide an overview of current research, which in turn may form the basis for joint publications or an edited book."
1161368,14040,507,RecDB: towards DBMS support for online recommender systems,2012,"Recommender systems have become popular in both commercial and academic settings. The main purpose of recommender systems is to suggest to users useful and interesting items or content (data) from a considerably large set of items. Traditional recommender systems do not take into account system issues (i.e., scalability and query efficiency). In an age of staggering web use growth and everpopular social media applications (e.g., Facebook, Google Reader), users are expressing their opinions over a diverse set of data (e.g., news stories, Facebook posts, retail purchases) faster than ever. In this paper, we propose  RecDB ; a fully fledged database system that provides online recommendation to users. We implement  RecDB  using existing open source database system Apache Derby, and we use showcase the effectiveness of  RecDB  by adopting inside Sindbad; a Location-Based Social Networking system developed at University of Minnesota."
1902904,14040,9896,An exploration on long-distance communications between left-behind children and their parents in China,2013,"In China, hundreds of millions of migrant workers have moved to cities or coastal regions for more or better-paid jobs and have left their children behind at their rural homes. Separated by thousands of kilometers, these left-behind children and their migrant parents use mobile phones as their primary - and often only - method of maintaining family connections. To better understand the use of technology in this long-distance communication, we conducted a multi-phased study using interviews and surveys in three different Chinese rural areas. In this paper, we report our findings on how these children communicate with their migrant parents and what information they exchange. We also discuss design implications derived from these findings that may improve communication between left-behind children and their parents."
2385511,14040,9896,Going digital: understanding paper and photo documentation practices in early childhood education,2013,"Documentation of development is a critical aspect of the work of early childhood education teachers. Through field observations and interviews, we detail the process and tools used in documenting development for children age three months to five-years-old at one school. Teachers use paper forms and printed photos to record and analyze observations of development. The evolving final product is a paper portfolio of development. This practice relies heavily on the teacher's ability to objectively observe children  in situ , create a record of the activity, and make salient the link between evidence and developmental milestones. We describe current paper and photo documentation practices in light of an online record keeping system that will be introduced at this school within the next year. The present analysis contributes to a growing literature on the role of paper and digital media in documentation."

The outcomes of this research have implications for CSCW researchers interested in using a participatory design approach to develop information systems to support the awareness of diverse users. Preliminary results describe four facets of awareness teams manage during emergency resuscitations that should be supported through display design."
2452196,14040,8235,Ontology-based Web Recommendation from tags,2011,"With the advent of social networks and tagging systems, The Internet has recently witnessed a big leap in the use of Web Recommendation Systems WRS. Based on users' likings of items and their browsing history on the world wide web, these systems are able to predict and recommend items and future purchases to users. They are being used now in various domains, like news article recommendation, product recommendation, and make-friend recommendation. WRS are still limited by several problems, of which are sparsity, and the new user problem. They also fail to make full use and harness the power of domain knowledge and semantic web ontologies. In this article, we discuss how an ontology-based WRS can utilize relations and concepts in an ontology, along with user-provided tags, to provide top-n recommendations without the need for item clustering or user ratings. For this purpose, we also propose a dimensionality reduction method based on the domain ontology, to solve the sparsity problem."
1482397,14040,10237,Not by search alone: how recommendations complement search results,2013,"This paper presents a novel approach to combining search and recommendations methods into one integrated system to satisfy user information seeking needs. It is shown theoretically and experimentally using simulations that the proposed combined approach outperforms pure search and pure recommendations in those cases when search is hindered by the user's inability to come up with a complete set of search criteria, and recommendation engine produces mediocre results."

2203886,14040,9896,Collaboration surrounding beacon use during companion avalanche rescue,2014,"When facing an avalanche, backcountry skiers need to work effectively both individually and as a group to rescue buried victims. If they don't, death is likely. One of the tools used by each person is a digital beacon that transmits an electromagnetic signal. If buried, others use their beacons to locate victims by searching for their signals, and then dig them out. This study focuses on the collaborative practices of avalanche rescue and the interactions with beacons while backcountry skiing. We conducted interviews with backcountry recreationists and experts, and we observed avalanche rescue practice scenarios. Our results highlight aspects and challenges of mental representation, trust, distributed cognition, and practice. Implications include three considerations for the redesign of beacons: simplicity, visibility and practice."
1139412,14040,8235,SmartCart: A consolidated shopping cart for pareto-optimal sourcing and fair discount distribution,2013,"This paper explores two interrelated questions: First, when buyers form a coalition to obtain volume discounts on the purchase of multiple items from multiple sellers, how many of each item should be purchased from each seller to maximize the overall discount? Secondly, when this discount is obtained successfully, how should it be allocated to the buyers who pooled their resources to make one successful group purchase? An auction is the context under which these questions are tested, using a scenario in which multiple buyers form a coalition to consolidate their individual shopping carts into one aggregated shopping cart. A relational database is used to simulate an interactive auction and tracks buyers, sellers, items, prices before discount, prices after discount, purchase decisions, and other key data. When a critical mass of items to be ordered is reached, the shopping carts are locked and the coalition's overall demand for each item is copied to an aggregated shopping cart. To clear the auction, a decision guidance query language (DGQL) is executed to determine, using a MILP optimization, the quantity of each item to be ordered from each supplier to maximize discounts. A formula that allocates discounts to members of the buying coalition is then proposed. DGQL provides a great degree of flexibility and extensibility in the specification of constraints using a high-level language that can be embedded directly in SQL. This analysis provides a foundation from which a working tool could be built to allow buyers to form ad hoc purchasing coalitions to achieve discounts that otherwise would be unavailable to the individual buyers acting in isolation."
2049772,14040,65,Virtual pebble: A haptic state display for pedestrians,2011,"We present a wearable haptic feedback device for the foot, which gives the sensation of a small pebble in a shoe when actuated and no sensation otherwise. Because it stimulates slowly-adapting as well as fast-adapting mechanoreceptors it is useful for displaying a condition that may persist over time, as well as the occurrence of an event. The feedback, which we call the “virtual pebble” due to its ability to appear on command, is intended as a complement to vibration feedback. We performed a user study to quantify perception accuracy during standing, walking, and jogging for haptic feedback combinations on the foot and knee from vibrotactors and the virtual pebble. We also quantified absolute perception thresholds for single vibration and virtual pebble actuations. Results show that subjects are able to correctly perceive a combination of the pebble and vibration much more accurately than a combination of two vibrations. In addition, subjects are most sensitive to vibration feedback while stationary but most sensitive to virtual pebble feedback while jogging. These findings suggest that the virtual pebble is useful as an additional channel of haptic feedback during ambulatory locomotion."
1772447,14040,9896,Catalyst: triggering collective action with thresholds,2014,"The web is a catalyst for drawing people together around shared goals, but many groups never reach critical mass. It can thus be risky to commit time or effort to a goal: participants show up only to discover that nobody else did, and organizers devote significant effort to causes that never get off the ground. Crowdfunding has lessened some of this risk by only calling in donations when an effort reaches a collective monetary goal. However, it leaves unsolved the harder problem of mobilizing effort, time and participation. We generalize the concept into activation thresholds, commitments that are conditioned on others' participation. With activation thresholds, supporters only need to show up for an event if enough other people commit as well. Catalyst is a platform that introduces activation thresholds for on-demand events. For more complex coordination needs, Catalyst also provides thresholds based on time or role (e.g., a bake sale requiring commitments for bakers, decorators, and sellers). In a multi-month field deployment, Catalyst helped users organize events including food bank volunteering, on-demand study groups, and mass participation events like a human chess game. Our results suggest that activation thresholds can indeed catalyze a large class of new collective efforts."
1624643,14040,9475,Concurrent learning adaptive identification of piecewise affine systems,2014,"In this paper, we enhance a recently proposed method for adaptive identification of piecewise affine systems by the use of concurrent learning. It is shown that the concurrent use of recorded and instantaneous data leads to exponential convergence of all subsystem parameters under verifiable conditions on the recorded data. A key advantage of the proposed method is that linear independence of the recorded data is sufficient, compared to the persistence of excitation assumed by previous adaptive parameter identifiers. Furthermore, the procedure tremendously improves the performance of adaptive identification for piecewise affine systems that previously suffered from slow convergence."
2537155,14040,369,An Asynchronous Multi-Channel MAC Protocol for Cooperative Networks,2011,"In this paper, we propose an asynchronous multi-channel MAC (AM-MAC) protocol for cooperative network, which keeps nodes aware of all the state information and introduce cooperative transmission into asynchronous multi-channel environment. This Multi-channel MAC design adds a helper-confirm phase in channel negotiation process and also different information tables and learning methods. As we analyzed the properly designed MAC frames and handshake schemes make it perfect in data channel selection and helper confirmation. Simulations have shown that the network throughput of AM-MAC is much higher than none-cooperative multi-channel MAC protocol when causing less dropped packets."
1609076,14040,9099,Beautifying Fisheye Images using Orientation and Shape Cues,2014,"Fisheye images, due to their wide range of vision, become more and more popular in our daily life. However, the fisheye images usually suffer from misalignment that reduces their visual pleasure. In this paper, we develop a computational method for enhancing the aesthetics of such images by exploiting the orientation and shape cues. More specifically, the orientation cue is based on the observation that cameras are often oriented when taking photos, so that their upvectors are parallel to vertical linear structures in the scene. While the shape one refers to that after repositing the fisheye image, the circular shape should be preserved. By employing these two rules as our basic aesthetic guidelines, our method can correct the rotation angle between the camera coordinate and the world coordinate to make the virtual camera oriented, and complete the missing part. Experimental results on a number of challenging indoor and outdoor fisheye images show the effectiveness of our approach, and demonstrate the superior aesthetics of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-arts."
1306680,14040,9078,Temporal modulation for computational video cross-talk reduction,2012,"Many recent prototypes for video collaboration, digital media sharing and gesture interfaces provide a video signal for display on a screen or surface and capture another video signal through the same screen or surface. The media captured in such systems, for transmission or for gesture user interfaces, needs to be separated from the displayed video. Otherwise, video cross-talk occurs. The prior, widely used temporal multiplexing avoids cross-talk by synchronizing camera capture with screen display so that the camera only captures when the screen does not display signal. This approach suffers from light loss (both displayed and captured) and increased display flicker due to the lower duty cycle of the displayed signal. This paper describes a new method, computational temporal modulation, that temporally modulates the displayed signal. The intentionally mixed signals captured by the camera are subsequently separated using computations. Our approach results in brighter display with less flicker and more signal captured by the camera. Experiments using a prototype collaboration system show good quality cross-talk reduction with light-weight real-time computation."
1226642,14040,369,A Formal Methodology Applied to Secure Over-the-Air Automotive Applications,2011,"The expected high complexity in future automotive applications will require to frequently update electronic devices supporting those applications. Even if in-car devices are trusted, potential attacks on over the air exchanges impose stringent requirements on both safety and security. To address the formal verification of safety properties, we have previously introduced the AVATAR UML profile whose methodology covers requirement, analysis, design, and formal verification stages [1]. We now propose to extend AVATAR to support both safety and security during all methodological stages, and in the same models. The paper applies the extended AVATAR to an over the-air protocol for trusted firmware updates of in-car control units, with a special focus on design and formal verification stages."
2584533,14040,235,Multimodal Signals and Holistic Interaction Structuring,2012,"This paper focusses on multimodal activity and its functions, especially as a communicative means to structure the discourse among the interlocutors: to give feedback and indicate turn-takings and mutual agreement. Starting from the assumption that natural language communication is a holistic process which aims at creating shared understanding, and requires interpretation of vocal and visual signals as part of successful interaction, the paper aims to form a coherent picture of the participants’ multimodal communication strategies and their engagement in the conversation. It presents observations on the conversational feedback and turn-taking functions especially related to head movement, hand gesturing, and body posture. The main claim concerns the meta-discursive function of visual signals, related to their use as unobtrusive means to control the interaction and to construct shared understanding. The paper deals with synchrony between head movements, hand gesturing and body posture, and builds models for the coordination of communication for intelligent and situated autonomous agents."
407242,14040,235,Predictive text entry for agglutinative languages using unsupervised morphological segmentation,2012,"Systems for predictive text entry on ambiguous keyboards typically rely on dictionaries with word frequencies which are used to suggest the most likely words matching user input. This approach is insufficient for agglutinative languages, where morphological phenomena increase the rate of out-of-vocabulary words. We propose a method for text entry, which circumvents the problem of out-of-vocabulary words, by replacing the dictionary with a Markov chain on morph sequences combined with a third order hidden Markov model (HMM) mapping key sequences to letter sequences and phonological constraints for pruning suggestion lists. We evaluate our method by constructing text entry systems for Finnish and Turkish and comparing our systems with published text entry systems and the text entry systems of three commercially available mobile phones. Measured using the keystrokes per character ratio (KPC) [8], we achieve superior results. For training, we use corpora, which are segmented using unsupervised morphological segmentation."
2096298,14040,369,QoS-Aware Load Balancing Algorithm for Joint Group Call Admission Control in Heterogeneous Networks,2012,"In heterogeneous network, it is likely that many mobile users send access requests at the same time. To avoid network congestion and provide users with good service experience, a novel joint group call admission control (JGCAC) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm includes two procedures: Firstly, the number of users allocated to each network is determined according to load balancing policy. Secondly, based on the evaluation values about network conditions and user requests, suitable users are admitted to each network by extended Hungary Algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can maintain load balancing among networks, reduce dropping rate and achieve a better user satisfaction."
145074,14040,9438,Strategic Alignment Maturity Model (SAMM) in a Cascading Balanced Scorecard (BSC) Environment: Utilization and Challenges,2012,"SAMM is a useful tool for measuring the maturity of business/IT alignment in an organization at the macro level. However, at the micro level, organizations use several frameworks including cascading BSC, ITIL, COBIT, etc. to align business and IT processes. The complexity of alignment increases with the existence of more than one tier of cascading and usage of different tools or frameworks. Studies have shown that measuring business/IT alignment at the micro level is difficult. Therefore, in order to accurately measure outcomes, mapping between metrics at all levels is required. It is also important to establish metrics that are aligned with those prescribed by SAMM. Using a multi-level cascading BSC that was previously published in BUSITAL by this author, this study attempts to apply the underlying components of SAMM and to establish relevant alignment metrics. It also highlights some applicability problems and suggests appropriate solutions for future implementations."
1603000,14040,8806,Harnessing geo-tagged resources for Web personalization,2012,"The increasing plethora of information available on the Web necessitates effective personalization mechanisms that allow users to retrieve pieces of information that are more likely to be of interest to them. Fortunately, the democratization of the Web (aka. Web 2.0) that provides online users with widely available tools that allow them contribute and integrate themselves into the global information space not only increases the sheer amounts of data, but also offers opportunities to extract  semantic meaning .   This paper therefore presents an integrated approach that harnesses geo-tagged web resources like tourism services or track data from bike trails to derive semantic annotations for objects from their geographic proximity. Following this, a recommendation mechanism is proposed that hybridizes collaborative mechanisms with the additional knowledge about semantic annotations to make predictions about what will be relevant to a user in a specific situation. The utility of this integrated approach is showcased by an adaptive Web-GIS scenario that supports travelers in their decision making. Finally, the proposed algorithms are evaluated using historical log data from real users who were exploring the map of a tourism destination. The results indicate that, despite very short interaction sequences, improvements compared to a collaborative filtering baseline can be achieved. An additional advantage lies in offering users more detailed options to express their search preferences that is not quantified by the presented evaluation scenario."
1401049,14040,65,Using attention cards to facilitate active participation in eliciting old adults' requirements for assistive robots,2013,"Engaging old users in the exploration of future product concepts can be challenging. It is of great value to find ways to actively involve them in the design of novel technologies intended for them, particularly when they have no prior experience of the technology in question. One obstacle in this process is that many old people do not identify themselves as being old or they think that it (the technology) would be good for others but not themselves. This paper presents a card method to overcome this obstacle. A full-day workshop with three internal focus groups was run with 14 participants. Based on our experience, we propose a way in which active participation in the process of eliciting user requirements for assistive robots from old users with no prior experience of assistive robots can be carried out."
2281373,14040,422,"Optimal recommendations under attraction, aversion, and social influence",2014,"People's interests are dynamically evolving, often affected by external factors such as trends promoted by the media or adopted by their friends. In this work, we model interest evolution through dynamic interest cascades: we consider a scenario where a user's interests may be affected by (a) the interests of other users in her social circle, as well as (b) suggestions she receives from a recommender system. In the latter case, we model user reactions through either attraction or aversion towards past suggestions. We study this interest evolution process, and the utility accrued by recommendations, as a function of the system's recommendation strategy. We show that, in steady state, the optimal strategy can be computed as the solution of a semi-definite program (SDP). Using datasets of user ratings, we provide evidence for the existence of aversion and attraction in real-life data, and show that our optimal strategy can lead to significantly improved recommendations over systems that ignore aversion and attraction."

Results: The research results show that six factors can predict whether a person will avoid future contact with the individual who unfriended them: whether the person discussed the event after it occurred, the emotional response to the unfriending, whether the person who was unfriended believed it was related to their offline behavior, the perceived geographical distance between dyad, whether difficulties were discussed between the dyad prior to the event and how the person valued the peak-tie strength of the relationship."
1515701,14040,9896,How research funding affects data sharing,2012,"In order to encourage interdisciplinary research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are mandating that researchers make their data public in an effort to provide incentives for data sharing. While this has encouraged data sharing in some fields, other fields with little NSF or NIH funding do not have the same incentives to encourage such sharing. In this work, we find that these other funding sources either fail to encourage data sharing and in some cases actively discourage it."

However, eBay also poses complexities resulting from high sparsity of relationships. Our discussion can be generalized beyond eBay to other marketplaces."
650008,14040,20561,Theory vs. Data-Driven Learning in Future E-Commerce,2013,"As personalization, adaptation and persuasion are called for in e-commerce and as computational power increases, a question emerges: should companies use theories to develop and run their e-commerce operations or does mere data based optimization do a better job? We explore different types of computer-based learning methods and present two evaluations of primarily data-driven learning applications that advance e-commerce in the direction of interactive e-selling relationships."
1806116,14040,8806,The relation between user intervention and user satisfaction for information recommendation,2012,"Although recommender systems have come to give recommendations with high precision, users are not always satisfied with the recommendations. User satisfaction is apparently influenced by many other factors. We specifically examined user intervention as one factor influencing user satisfaction. We tested two hypotheses: user intervention itself improves user satisfaction; and the more users intervene in the recommendation process, the more they are satisfied with the recommendations. We conducted an experiment incorporating user intervention of several kinds to reveal the relation between user intervention and user satisfaction."

Different mechanisms for interacting with different crowds have been strategically implemented. Various sociotechnical challenges and unexpected outcomes have emerged.
2124290,14040,9896,Recognizing team context during simulated missions,2012,We investigated ways to automatically analyze movement and verbal behavior of teams of soldiers engaged in simulated military missions. Analysis of location data revealed that soldiers' locations were consistent with 3 stationary patterns and 2 movement patterns. Analysis of their dialogue detected statistical regularities. An automated text classifier was developed that employed these regularities to code dialogue utterances. These analyses demonstrate the feasibility of interpreting collaborative activity automatically and constructing models of team context for teams of soldiers engaged in trained activities.
2227302,14040,65,An augmented reality system for teaching sequential tasks to a household robot,2011,We present a method of instructing a sequential task to a household robot using a hand-held augmented reality device. The user decomposes a high-level goal such as “prepare a drink” into steps such as delivering a mug under a kettle and pouring hot water into the mug. The user takes a photograph of each step using the device and annotates it with necessary information via touch operation. The resulting sequence of annotated photographs serves as a reference for review and reuse at a later time. We created a working prototype system with various types of robots and appliances.
2523969,14040,9896,Understanding how the projection of availability state impacts the reception incoming communication,2013,"Many communication systems infer and project information about a user's availability, making it possible for others to decide whether and how to contact that user. Presumably when the system infers people are busy, they are less open to interruption. But analysis of 103,962 phone calls made using a popular enterprise communications tool reveals that people are actually significantly more likely to answer the phone when the system projects that they are busy than at other times. A follow-up survey of 569 users of the system suggests that this seemingly counter-intuitive fact may arise because people care a lot about the recipient's availability when initiating phone communications and are unlikely to attempt to call someone who appears to be busy unless the communication is important. Recipients thus perceive incoming calls as more important when they are busy than at other times, making them more likely to answer."
2474292,14040,9896,Who gives a tweet?: evaluating microblog content value,2012,"While microblog readers have a wide variety of reactions to the content they see, studies have tended to focus on extremes such as retweeting and unfollowing. To understand the broad continuum of reactions in-between, which are typically not shared publicly, we designed a website that collected the first large corpus of follower ratings on Twitter updates. Using our dataset of over 43,000 voluntary ratings, we find that nearly 36% of the rated tweets are worth reading, 25% are not, and 39% are middling. These results suggest that users tolerate a large amount of less-desired content in their feeds. We find that users value information sharing and random thoughts above me-oriented or presence updates. We also offer insight into evolving social norms, such as lack of context and misuse of @mentions and hashtags. We discuss implications for emerging practice and tool design."
1815816,14040,8228,A Development of Network Topology of Wireless Packet Communications for Disaster Situation with Genetic Algorithms or with Dijkstra's,2011,"This paper discusses the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) and Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize load network topologies in distributed packet communication systems. These algorithm is fully distributed in which information is dynamically updated at each movement of packet terminal almost realtime. Multiple distributed paradigms are adopted so that each terminal transmits information on the network topology throughout the wireless and satellite network. A GA model is effective when a network is configured with a sufficiently large number (N) of units. However, in marine applications or for use at a disaster site, the number (N) of units may be low, such as 7 or 8. In such cases, Dijkstra's algorithm is more efficient than genetic algorithms. With Dijkstra's algorithm, a system of 0 or 1 is not used in the adjacency matrix determinant, but each path can be assigned a weight (corresponding to the distance of each terminal). Based on field experiments, we will seek to manage network topologies by transmitting the adjacency matrix determinant bilaterally."
2335177,14040,9896,Hospital robot at work: something alien or an intelligent colleague?,2012,"This paper describes a case study of the initial reactions to a transport robot running in a semi-public hospital environment. The robot was transporting goods and samples for an orthopedic department, moving within and between different departments for 13 days, and was used by the staff for five days. Based on this case, we discuss how the robot was perceived by staff and visitors and purpose an initial framework, a utopian model, describing four different perspectives; an alien, a machine, a worker and as a work partner. This has been derived from interviews, questionnaires and observation, and exemplifies different qualities that the robot was ascribed. We discuss how the perspectives may mutually co-exist and change, and are affected by time and familiarity with the robot at work."
1932204,14040,369,A Multi-Channel Cooperative MAC,2011,"Analytical formulations of the throughput of multi-channel medium access control (MAC) protocols are presented. Both multi-channel multi-rate MAC and multi-channel CoopMAC protocols are considered. A discrete time Markov chain is used to model the number of nodes communicating with the AP in the multi-channel multi-rate MAC protocol, while another discrete time Markov chain is used to model the number of data channels used in the multi-channel CoopMAC protocol. The throughput of the multi-channel multi-rate MAC protocol is expressed as a function of the number of data channels, the channel transmission rate and the solutions to the first Markov chain, while the throughput of the multi-channel CoopMAC protocol is expressed as a function of the number of data channels, the channel transmission rates, and the solutions to the latter Markov chain. The first Markov chain only considers direct one-hop links communications in the multi-channel multi-rate MAC, while the latter Markov chain accounts not only the direct one-hop links communications but also for faster two-hop relaying links communications in the multi-channel CoopMAC as well. Numerical results of the throughput corresponding to typical values are presented. The results also clearly demonstrate the advantage of our proposed multi-channel CoopMAC protocol over a multi-channel multi-rate MAC protocol."
2334193,14040,9896,Major life changes and behavioral markers in social media: case of childbirth,2013,"We explore the harnessing of social media as a window on changes around major life events in individuals and larger populations. We specifically examine patterns of activity, emotional, and linguistic correlates for childbirth and postnatal course. After identifying childbirth events on Twitter, we analyze daily posting patterns and language usage before and after birth by new mothers, and make inferences about the status and dynamics of changes in emotions expressed following childbirth. We find that childbirth is associated with some changes for most new mothers, but approximately 15% of new mothers show significant changes in their online activity and emotional expression postpartum. We observe that these mothers can be distinguished by linguistic changes captured by shifts in a relatively small number of words in their social media posts. We introduce a greedy differencing procedure to identify the type of language that characterizes significant changes in these mothers during postpartum. We conclude with a discussion about how such characterizations might be applied to recognizing and understanding health and well-being in women following childbirth."
2330414,14040,9896,VidWiki: enabling the crowd to improve the legibility of online educational videos,2014,"Videos are becoming an increasingly popular medium for communicating information, especially for online education. Recent efforts by organizations like Coursera, edX, Udacity and Khan Academy have produced thousands of educational videos with hundreds of millions of views in their attempt to make high quality teaching available to the masses. As a medium, videos are time-consuming to produce and cannot be easily modified after release. As a result, errors or problems with legibility are common. While text-based information platforms like Wikipedia have benefitted enormously from crowdsourced contributions for the creation and improvement of content, the various limitations of video hinder the collaborative editing and improvement of educational videos. To address this issue, we present VidWiki, an online platform that enables students to iteratively improve the presentation quality and content of educational videos. Through the platform, users can improve the legibility of handwriting, correct errors, or translate text in videos by overlaying typeset content such as text, shapes, equations, or images. We conducted a small user study in which 13 novice users annotated and revised Khan Academy videos. Our results suggest that with only a small investment of time on the part of viewers, it may be possible to make meaningful improvements in online educational videos."
1074136,14040,65,A field study with primary school children on perception of social presence and interactive behavior with a pet robot,2012,"This paper presents a study on (1) how children experience a pet robot, (2) how they play with it and (3) how children's perceptions on and interaction with pet robots are interrelated. The study features different types of subjective and objective techniques to assess the degree of perceived social entity from self-reports (i.e. questionnaires) and observed behavior. Three short questionnaires and an ad hoc code scheme of 15 low-level micro-behaviors were developed. 28 scholars aged 8 to 12 were observed at school during a play period with a Pleo robot and asked to answer the questionnaires. We found that the different questionnaire based methods were in line each other. Therefore, anyone of them can be used to measure the experience of a social entity. Play analyses showed that the two most prevalent behaviors were clearly social: petting the robot and showing it objects to engage in interaction. Moreover, children spent on average less than one per cent of the session time treating the robot as an artifact. However, significant covariation between the experience of a social entity and observed behavior could not be established."
2799784,14040,422,"Committee based prediction system for recommendation: KDD Cup 2011, track2",2011,"This paper describes a solution to the 2011 KDD Cup competition, Track2: discriminating between highly rated tracks and unrated tracks in a Yahoo! Music dataset. Our approach was to use supervised learning based on 65 features generated using various techniques such as collaborative filtering, SVD, and similarity scoring. During our modeling stage, we created a number of predictors including logistic regression, artificial neural networks and gradient-boosted decision trees. To further improve robustness and reduce the variance, we used three of our top performing models and took a weighted average for the final submission, which achieved 4.3768% error."
1891513,14040,9896,Your time zone or mine?: a study of globally time zone-shifted collaboration,2011,"We conducted interviews with sixteen members of teams that worked across global time zone differences. Despite time zone differences of about eight hours, collaborators still found time to synchronously meet. The interviews identified the diverse strategies teams used to find time windows to interact, which often included times outside of the normal workday and connecting from home to participate. Recent trends in increased work connectivity from home and blurred boundaries between work and home enabled more scheduling flexibility. While email use was understandably prevalent, there was also general interest in video, although obstacles remain for widespread usage. We propose several design implications for supporting this growing population of workers that need to span global time zone differences."
2313204,14040,9896,Welcome!: social and psychological predictors of volunteer socializers in online communities,2013,"Volunteer socializers are members of a community who voluntarily help newcomers become familiar with the popular practices and attitudes of the community. In this paper, we explore the social and psychological predictors of volunteer socializers on reddit, an online social news-sharing community. Through a survey of over 1000 reddit users, we found that social identity, prosocial-orientation and generalized reciprocity are all predictors of socializers in the community. Interestingly, a user's tenure with the online community has a quadratic effect on volunteer socialization behaviors -- new and long-time members are both more likely to help newcomers than those in between. We conclude with design implications for motivating users to help newcomers."
1324433,14040,9099,Orchestration: tv-like mixing grammars applied to video-communication for social groups,2013,"This paper reports research into video-mediated synchronous communication within social groups. The ultimate aim of the research is to create a more natural medium for interaction, aware of the context in which it operates, able to continuously adapt itself to the communication needs and optimise the way in which it captures and transmits aspects of the communication. This, is hypothesised, can be achieved by equipping each of the various locations involved in the communication with multiple controllable video cameras and microphones, and mixing the resulting content through techniques similar to those used in television?a process referred to as orchestration. Through orchestration, each location should be able to receive the appropriate perspectives and levels of detail, thus generating experiences in which the spatial separation between participants is minimised. The paper defines the concept of orchestration and presents two major evaluation experiments that provide supporting evidence for the main assumption and motivate further research, in richer interaction contexts, into this concept."
1895986,14040,9896,Impression management work: how seniors with chronic pain address disruptions in their interactions,2012,"Chronic pain is an illness that affects nearly a third of senior citizens. Uncontrolled chronic pain can manifest constantly and/or intermittently, and can disrupt seniors' ability to plan or to maintain synchronous and scheduled contact with others. Such disruptions can expose seniors to stigma from others who do not understand this illness, social isolation, and a range of challenges to their social autonomy. We present results from an interview study of 27 seniors with chronic pain exploring how they mitigate and manage these disruptions in their lives. Drawing on Goffman's theory of impression management, we found that participants invested significant effort into controlling both the context of interactions and others' expectations, in order to mitigate the potential negative social consequences of disruptions. In performing this work, seniors were selective about what information they revealed to others about their chronic pain and availability. Given such efforts, seniors with chronic pain have unique needs for technologies to support their social interactions."
2148943,14040,9896,Collaboratively crowdsourcing workflows with turkomatic,2012,"Preparing complex jobs for crowdsourcing marketplaces requires careful attention to workflow design, the process of decomposing jobs into multiple tasks, which are solved by multiple workers. Can the crowd help design such workflows? This paper presents Turkomatic, a tool that recruits crowd workers to aid requesters in planning and solving complex jobs. While workers decompose and solve tasks, requesters can view the status of worker-designed workflows in real time; intervene to change tasks and solutions; and request new solutions to subtasks from the crowd. These features lower the threshold for crowd employers to request complex work. During two evaluations, we found that allowing the crowd to plan without requester supervision is partially successful, but that requester intervention during workflow planning and execution improves quality substantially. We argue that Turkomatic's collaborative approach can be more successful than the conventional workflow design process and discuss implications for the design of collaborative crowd planning systems."
1378799,14040,65,Active or passive?: Investigating the impact of robot role in meetings,2014,"Meetings are an integral part of the work place and society in general. Research in Computer Supported Cooperative Work attempts to facilitate and make the process of meetings more effective. Our vision is that the incorporation of social robots in such human-human collaborative settings can assist and improve the effectiveness of a meeting. In this paper we present an empirical study in which pairs of participants collaborate in a meeting scenario with a Nao humanoid robot. Using a within-subjects design, we manipulated the robot's role within the meeting as being either “active” versus “passive”/“service-oriented”. Our results show that the more active robot was deemed as more more alive and social, had the participants more emotionally involved and caused more verbal engagement from the participants as compared to a passive service robot. In conclusion, we speculate on the inclusion of a collaborative robot as a meeting partner."
2320346,14040,9896,The future of crowd work,2013,"Paid crowd work offers remarkable opportunities for improving productivity, social mobility, and the global economy by engaging a geographically distributed workforce to complete complex tasks on demand and at scale. But it is also possible that crowd work will fail to achieve its potential, focusing on assembly-line piecework. Can we foresee a future crowd workplace in which we would want our children to participate? This paper frames the major challenges that stand in the way of this goal. Drawing on theory from organizational behavior and distributed computing, as well as direct feedback from workers, we outline a framework that will enable crowd work that is complex, collaborative, and sustainable. The framework lays out research challenges in twelve major areas: workflow, task assignment, hierarchy, real-time response, synchronous collaboration, quality control, crowds guiding AIs, AIs guiding crowds, platforms, job design, reputation, and motivation."
2330881,14040,9896,Civic action brokering platforms: facilitating local engagement with ACTion Alexandria,2014,"Local communities are turning to new online systems to help motivate and coordinate local volunteerism and problem solving. Inspired by the American barn raising tradition, ACTion Alexandria is designed to help local residents and service-oriented organizations collectively take action to address pressing local needs. This paper introduces civic action brokering as a new theoretical concept and frames it within a year-long evaluation of ACTion Alexandria. A mixed-method, case study approach was used to understand how social practices, roles, and technologies helped or hindered successful action brokering. Successes were attributed to a competent community manager, institutional support from an existing nonprofit brokering agency, effective use of social media, a synergistic partnership with nonprofits that helped grow each group's donor network, and emphasis on promoting immediate actions and soliciting ideas for Community Challenges among residents and nonprofit organizations."
2314915,14040,9896,Ubiquitous collaborative activity virtual environments,2012,"We introduce a new paradigm of collaborative computing called the Ubiquitous Collaborative Activity Virtual Environment (UCAVE). UCAVEs are portable immersive virtual environments that leverage mobile communication platforms, motion trackers and displays to facilitate ad-hoc virtual collaboration. We discuss design criteria and research challenges for UCAVEs, as well as a prototype hardware configuration that enables UCAVE interactions using modern smart phones and head mounted displays."
2459015,14040,65,Exploring the affect of abstract motion in social human-robot interaction,2011,"We present our exploration of the emotional impact that abstract robot motion has on human-robot interaction (HRI). We argue for the importance of designing for the fundamental characteristics of physical robot motion as distinct from designing the robot's visual appearance or functional context. We discuss our design approach, the creation of an abstract robotic motion platform that is nearly formless and affordance-less, and our evaluation of the affect abstract motion had on more than thirty participants which interacted with our robotic platform in a series of studies. We detail our results and explain how different styles of robot motion were mapped to emotional responses in human observers. We believe that our findings can inform and provide important insight into the purposeful use of motion as a design tool in social human-robot interaction."
985673,14040,507,Distance matters: an exploratory analysis of the linguistic features of Flickr photo tag metadata in relation to impression management,2012,"Tags are words that users add to shared multimedia contents as metadata to facilitate better categorization and improved sharing experiences. With the burgeoning growth of shared images and videos over online social networks, a huge number of tags is being populated everyday in public or shared databases. While one major reason for tagging a photo or a video incorporates the functional needs for the organization of that shared object, people also use tags as a medium of communication for conveying their emotions to their family, friends, and other contacts. The diversity in the linguistic features of these tags demonstrates some interesting patterns that reflect different facets of human nature in managing their online impression to their social peers. This paper investigates how some linguistic features of tags associated with the Flickr photos change with the distance between the user's home location and the location where the photo is taken. In our exploratory analysis affective and relativ words and their multiplicative interaction show correlations with this distance. These initial findings help us to have a better understanding of online social phenomena related to the expression of emotions and sharing information. At the same time, this might have some indirect implications to understand the insight of impression management in online communities."
2197607,14040,9896,Express location: supporting coordination of mobile delivery work,2011,"This paper introduces Express Location, a mobile web application, supporting drivers in delivery service in the daily coordination of work. Remote communication and cooperation takes place on a shared map view around the drivers' locations and next stop, through a drawing/doodling tool and multiple visual object representations. The aim is to understand the working situation and the use of locations in the daily work to better support the coordination of mobile delivery work."
2528851,14040,9896,Beyond end user content to collaborative knowledge mapping: interrelations among community social tools,2014,"Most studies of social tools examine usage of each tool in isolation. Instead, we explore how online communities (a) combine multiple social tools, and (b) use social tools together with external tools. Based on interviews with community leaders and quantitative analysis of 128 online community spaces, we explored the combined use of six social software tools--wikis, blogs, forums, social bookmarks, social file repositories, and task-management tools. We contribute a detailed characterization of how enterprise online communities combine multiple social tools, adding to our understanding of community behaviors: Communities combine social tools to curate and organize complex information spaces. When combined, each tool is used for limited core functions; thus 'social' features are not always leveraged for every tool. Leaders and members divide labor by tool boundaries. Our results suggest that an important overlooked aspect of social media concerns how different tools can be effectively combined. While most prior work on communities emphasizes end user content, we identify additional important design activities where community participants curate and organize pre-existing content from multiple tools to serve their community needs."
2345360,14040,8385,BumbleBee: a refactoring environment for spreadsheet formulas,2014,"Spreadsheets are widely used in industry. It is estimated that end-user programmers outnumber regular programmers by a factor of 5. However, spreadsheets are error-prone: several reports exist of companies that have lost big sums of money due to spreadsheet errors. In previous work, spreadsheet smells have proven to be the cause of some of these errors. To that end, we have developed a tool that can apply refactorings to spreadsheet formulas, implementing our previous work on spreadsheet refactoring, which showed that spreadsheet formula smells are very common and that refactorings for them are widely applicable and that refactoring them with a tool is both quicker and less error-prone. Our new tool Bumblebee is able to execute refactorings originating from both these papers, by means of an extensible syntax, and can furthermore apply refactorings on entire groups of formulas, thus improving upon the existing tool RefBook. Finally, BumbleBee can also execute transformations other than refactorings."
2380770,14040,9896,Privacy practices in collaborative environments: a study of emergency department staff,2014,"Privacy research has long focused on the individual. Yet most organizations are highly collaborative where teamwork is the norm. To examine privacy practices in collaborative settings, we conducted an ethnographic study of a highly collaborative and information-intensive setting -- an emergency Dept. (ED). We found that ED staff's work practices did not always align with the organization's privacy policies and procedures. We then discuss the use of workarounds when privacy policies interfere with work practices, the challenge of assigning accountability for enforcing privacy in collaborative environments, and implications for technical and policy design. We conclude with some thoughts on the future of privacy research in collaborative settings."
2337997,14040,9896,Capturing the mood: facebook and face-to-face encounters in the workplace,2014,"What makes people feel happy, engaged and challenged at work? We conducted an in situ study of Facebook and face-to-face interactions examining how they influence people's mood in the workplace. Thirty-two participants in an organization were each observed for five days in their natural work environment using automated data capture and experience sampling. Our results show that online and offline social interactions are associated with different moods, suggesting that they serve different purposes at work. Face-to-face interactions are associated with a positive mood throughout the day whereas Facebook use and engagement in work contribute to a positive feeling at the end of the day. Email use is associated with negative affect and along with multitasking, is associated with a feeling of engagement and challenge throughout the day. Our findings provide initial evidence of how online and offline interactions affect workplace mood, and could inform practices to improve employee morale."
2370045,14040,422,Taxonomy-informed latent factor models for implicit feedback,2011,"We describe a latent-factor-model-based approach to the Track 2 task of KDD Cup 2011, which required learning to discriminate between highly rated and unrated items from a large dataset of music ratings. We take the pairwise ranking route, training our models to rank the highly rated items above the unrated items that are sampled from the same distribution. Using the item relationship information from the provided taxonomy to constrain item representations results in improved predictive performance. Providing the model with features summarizing the user's rating history as it relates to the item being ranked leads to further gains, producing the best single model result on Track 2."
2155530,14040,9896,Local experts and online review sites,2012,"Sites such as Yelp and Yahoo! Local provide a valuable source of knowledge about both new and familiar places. However, they represent an indirect source of local knowledge. Many are likely to prefer learning from the people who know their neighborhoods best: local experts. In this study of online review websites (ORWs), we examine attitudes about local knowledge and personal investment in local neighborhoods. We explore how these and other beliefs about local neighborhoods and local content may be related to interactions with ORWs. Finally, we argue that our findings suggest several important directions for future research and design investigations."
1624882,14040,9015,E-Gesture: a collaborative architecture for energy-efficient gesture recognition with hand-worn sensor and mobile devices,2011,"Gesture is a promising mobile User Interface modality that enables eyes-free interaction without stopping or impeding movement. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of E-Gesture, an energy-efficient gesture recognition system using a hand-worn sensor device and a smartphone. E-gesture employs a novel gesture recognition architecture carefully crafted by studying sporadic occurrence patterns of gestures in continuous sensor data streams and analyzing the energy consumption characteristics of both sensors and smartphones. We developed a  closed-loop collaborative segmentation architecture , that can (1) be implemented in resource-scarce sensor devices, (2) adaptively turn off power-hungry motion sensors without compromising recognition accuracy, and (3) reduce false segmentations generated from dynamic changes of body movement. We also developed a  mobile gesture classification architecture  for smartphones that enables HMM-based classification models to better fit multiple mobility situations."
885783,14040,8927,Retweet or not?: personalized tweet re-ranking,2013,"With Twitter being widely used around the world, users are facing enormous new tweets every day. Tweets are ranked in chronological order regardless of their potential interestedness. Users have to scan through pages of tweets to find useful information. Thus more personalized ranking scheme is needed to filter the overwhelmed information. Since retweet history reveals users' personal preference for tweets, we study how to learn a predictive model to rank the tweets according to their probability of being retweeted. In this way, users can find interesting tweets in a short time. To model the retweet behavior, we build a graph made up of three types of nodes: users, publishers and tweets. To incorporate all sources of information like users' profile, tweet quality, interaction history, etc, nodes and edges are represented by feature vectors. All these feature vectors are mapped to node weights and edge weights. Based on the graph, we propose a feature-aware factorization model to re-rank the tweets, which unifies the linear discriminative model and the low-rank factorization model seamlessly. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on a real dataset crawled from Twitter. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our model."
1130935,14040,422,Response prediction using collaborative filtering with hierarchies and side-information,2011,"In online advertising, response prediction is the problem of estimating the probability that an advertisement is clicked when displayed on a content publisher's webpage. In this paper, we show how response prediction can be viewed as a problem of matrix completion, and propose to solve it using matrix factorization techniques from collaborative filtering (CF). We point out the two crucial differences between standard CF problems and response prediction, namely the requirement of predicting probabilities rather than scores, and the issue of confidence in matrix entries. We address these issues using a matrix factorization analogue of logistic regression, and by applying a principled confidence-weighting scheme to its objective. We show how this factorization can be seamlessly combined with explicit features or side-information for pages and ads, which let us combine the benefits of both approaches. Finally, we combat the extreme sparsity of response prediction data by incorporating hierarchical information about the pages and ads into our factorization model. Experiments on three very large real-world datasets show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for response prediction."
2315566,14040,9896,Mining social relationship types in an organization using communication patterns,2013,"Our goal is to show that it is possible to automatically infer social relationship types among people who stay together in an organization by analyzing communication patterns. We collected indoor co-location data and instant messenger data from 22 participants for one month. Based on the data, we designed and explored several indicators which are considered to be useful for mining social relationship types. We applied machine learning techniques using the indicators and found that it is possible to develop an intelligent method to infer social relationship types."
1851096,14040,9896,"What do you think?: a case study of benefit, expectation, and interaction in a large online critique community",2012,"Critique is an indispensible part of creative work and many online communities have formed for this shared purpose. As design choices within the communities can impact the effectiveness of the critiques produced, it is important to study these communities and offer guidance for decisions. In this paper, we report the results of a case study exploring one large online community dedicated to critique in the domain of digital photography. We analyzed a large corpus of interaction data to understand the benefit of participation, the response dynamics, factors predicting critique ratings, and patterns of reciprocal interaction. Interviews with users were also conducted to uncover motives for participation and expectations of the critiques within the community. The results and insights gained from this work were distilled into recommendations for improving the design of systems that support community-based critique of creative artifacts."
1785093,14040,9896,Impression formation in social work-sharing sites,2013,"My dissertation work focuses on understanding how and why professionals use activity traces generated by social work-sharing sites online to form impressions of fellow professionals' expertise and inform personal interactions around work artifacts. I have conducted interviews with professionals in different domains who post and share their work online. These findings will then inform a model of factors contributing to impression formation in this specific context, as well as experiments testing and providing design recommendations for improving members' ability to interact and effectively learn about each other."
2607386,14040,422,Personalized Ranking for non-uniformly sampled items,2011,"We develop an adapted version of the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) optimization criterion (Rendle et al., 2009) that takes the non-uniform sampling of negative test items — as in track 2 of the KDD Cup 2011 — into account. Furthermore, we present a modified version of the generic BPR learning algorithm that maximizes the new criterion. We use it to train ranking matrix factorization models as components of an ensemble. Additionally, we combine the ranking predictions with rating prediction models to also take into account rating data.#R##N##R##N#With an ensemble of such combined models, we ranked 8th (out of more than 300 teams) in track 2 of the KDD Cup 2011, without using the additional taxonomic information offered by the competition organizers."
1599868,14040,422,Modeling impression discounting in large-scale recommender systems,2014,"Recommender systems have become very important for many online activities, such as watching movies, shopping for products, and connecting with friends on social networks. User behavioral analysis and user feedback (both explicit and implicit) modeling are crucial for the improvement of any online recommender system. Widely adopted recommender systems at LinkedIn such as People You May Know and Endorsements are evolving by analyzing user behaviors on impressed recommendation items.   In this paper, we address modeling impression discounting of recommended items, that is, how to model user's no-action feedback on impressed recommended items. The main contributions of this paper include (1) large-scale analysis of impression data from LinkedIn and KDD Cup; (2) novel anti-noise regression techniques, and its application to learn four different impression discounting functions including linear decay, inverse decay, exponential decay, and quadratic decay; (3) applying these impression discounting functions to LinkedIn's People You May Know and Endorsements recommender systems."
1555661,14040,8806,gSVD++: supporting implicit feedback on recommender systems with metadata awareness,2013,"This paper proposes a recommender algorithm denominated gSVD++ which exploits implicit feedback from users by considering not only the latent space of factors describing the user and item, but also the available metadata associated to the content. Such descriptions are an important source to construct a user profile containing relevant and meaningful information about his/her preferences. The method is evaluated on the MovieLens dataset, being compared against other approaches reported in the literature. The results show the effectiveness of incorporating metadata awareness into a latent factor model."
639775,14040,20561,"Introduction to Analytics, Informatics and Decision Support for Sustainability Minitrack",2013,"The final report of the World Commission on the Environment and Development, also known as the Brundtland Report, defines sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present with-out compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Subsequent international efforts such as the Rio de Janeiro Conference in 1992, the publication of Agenda 21, the Rio+5 special session of the United Nations (UN) in 1997, the formation of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development in 1997, and the Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development can be credited with raising environmental concerns to increase public awareness, serving as an initial focus and impetus for collaboration as well as conflict between government, industry, and academia. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, revealed at the Earth Summit 2002, affirmed commitment by the UN to fully implement Agenda 21. Environmental management systems standards (EMSS) such as ISO 14001 and the European Eco-management and Audit System (EMAS) provide a sound practical basis for environmental management within organizations. Information systems (IS) support both immediate action and sustainable long-term strategies, helping to address the urgency and scope of environmental problems. This mini-track emphasizes the significant research synergies that exist between IS and environmental management for sustainable development from an organizational as well as a technical perspective. Collaboration and cross-fertilization between these domains can be mutually beneficial and may in fact present unique, timely and socially relevant 'real-world' research opportunities as well as viable public sources of empirical ecological information for interdisciplinary research and application. The mini-track accommodates both research articles and practitioner reports exploring technical and organizational issues that pertain to the development, implementation, and deployment of IS in sustainable development. This year's conference has attracted contributions along two broad themes. The first theme centers around global scenarios and information management. In that regard, New lands et al. describe an integrated model for exploring potential impacts of global changes on the Canadian agricultural system. The methodology integrates stakeholder/expert knowledge, empirical and process-based model algorithms using remote-sensing and national agri-environmental datasets. With respect to energy and carbon emissions, Melville and Saldanha present the results of an exploratory empirical analysis into the extent to which regulations (Kyoto Protocol and UNFCCC) and management practices (carbon emission reduction targets and managerial incentives) are associated with their adoption. The results suggest that managerial incentives and carbon reduction targets are strongly associated with the adoption of information systems for managing environmental resources. With the proliferation of EMIS, Jamous et al. explores issues and requirements pertaining to the development of EMIS with a particular emphasis on the development of a Light-Weight Composite Environmental Performance Indicators (LWC-EPI) solution. The second theme centers on stakeholder knowledge. Rogers et al. use agent-based modeling to study the complexities associated with making decisions in an IT/S project context. The findings reveal variations in the types of project decisions, and show that the inclusion of environmental considerations improves the financial and environmental benefits of the resulting project portfolio. Scharl et al. also focus on environmental decision making by presenting a Web intelligence and visual analytics platform to aggregate, integrate and analyze climate change knowledge from multiple stakeholders. Gray et al. recognize the importance of stakeholder knowledge in environmental decision making by proposing a participatory modeling tool based on Fuzzy Logic Cognitive Mapping (FCM) called 'Mental Modeler' which makes the mental models of stakeholders explicit and provides an opportunity to incorporate different types of knowledge into environmental decision-making, define hypotheses to be tested, and run scenarios to determine perceived outcomes of proposed policies. While Jetter and Sperry describe an approach that is based on Fuzzy Cognitive Map Modeling that helps product planners to capture, understand, and assess stakeholder needs and their interdependencies to aid systematically in the design and selection of product concepts that avoid corporate irresponsibility."
864272,14040,20561,"Introduction to Materiality of Information, Documents, and Work Minitrack",2013,"The debates on materiality and sociomateriality, hailing from science studies and organization studies, allow information systems (IS) researchers to evade received distinctions between the social, natural and technical. The literatures that inform this Minitrack contest a purely information-based perspective that posit abstract meanings and immaterial data divorced from situated contexts. Instead the bodies of work that inspire this Minitrack draw on new materialist, pragmatist, and practice-oriented perspectives (amongst others) hailing primarily from the social sciences that analyze the social activities going into the manufacturing of documents through the manipulations of various material forms. The notion of the document serves as a lens into the practical and material nature of what organizational members do day in and day out. Documents are sociomaterial in that they are artifacts -- and, thus, embody the technical infrastructure -- and social -- as they embody both the work practices and shared orientations of those involved. For example, our production and distribution of this mini-track introduction involved the technology of word processors, several different computers, cloud services, hard copies, email messages and PDF files. Your reading of this document likely involves numerous other technologies, you may be reading a paper version of this introduction, part of the conference packet, or you might have stumbled over it among many other mini-track introductions on the HICSS-48 website, each case, again, depends on a set of web clients, computers, and cloud servers amid a web of social practices. Shared social practices are reflected in the degree to which you, the reader, and we, the authors, understand and share common knowledge about the form and contents of the genre of conference calls in general and HICSS calls in particular. Our shared activities are the basics of work practice. And, the heterogeneous material forms of this call for proposals are some of the infrastructures supporting HICSS and the broader information systems field. In short, the production of this call involves both the work of documenting and document work. As increasingly complex information systems are adopted and adapted within and across organizational environments, there is pressing need for more careful study of document work and the work of documenting within such contexts. Two innovative papers address this topic in this year's minitrack. First, Samantha R. Meyer, Casey S. Pierce, Yubo Kou, Paul M. Leonardi, Bonnie A. Nardi, Diane E. Bailey explore the topic of off shoring. However, they do not focus on the impact off shoring has on communication between people at different sites. Instead they investigate impeded person-to-object interactions at two offshore work sites representing two different occupations: automotive engineering and graphic design Second, Mohammad Hossein Jarrahi studies how digital and physical properties play a role in shaping people's perceptions and actions around the use of Fit bit devices. He argues that we cannot understand the role of information in those activities without examining how it is entwined with the technologies that record, process, share, and represent it. The papers represent an emerging literature converging old and new approaches to sociomateriality and documenting practices. Notably, last year's best paper award in the Digital and Social Media track went to a paper from the present minitrack authored by Megan Finn, Janaki Srinivasan and Rajesh Veeraraghavan. In that paper the authors explored how the circulation of everyday bureaucratic documents opens up the possibility for a population to gaze back and see the state. They did so by comparing the materiality of welfare documents in India and in the U.S. Building on work presented in prior HICSS tracks, this scholarship reignites a body of work on the genre of digital documents that has found a home in the Digital Media track since the mid-90s. Through its continued development, we find new practical and analytic relevance for study of information systems in the years ahead."
1730563,14040,20561,Introduction to the Creativity and Innovation in Teams and Organizations Minitrack,2012,"Innovation is a critical force in organizational performance and survival. Changes in technology, globalization, and increased competition have all created an environment in which creativity and innovation are needed in order to cope with situational and economic pressures and frequent changes. Designers and Developers of organizational systems must therefore innovate almost continuously to keep the organization aligned with such changes. Creativity is a critical pre-condition for innovation. Generating novel and creative ideas are the key to innovation and growth in every organization today. Providing employees with tools to think creatively has been proven to increase innovation in organizations. Research shows that organizations which have established skill-bases and tools for creativity outperform the competition in terms of revenue, rolling out new products, innovation and growth. Though organizations deploy groups for most creative processes, there has been little research in the area of group creativity. Most creative research is focused on individual factors affecting creativity. Many challenges that arise from pursuing creativity in teams remain unexplored. Consequently, it is important that creativity in teams be given a central place in organizational research. This year we received twelve papers, six of which were accepted. These submissions cover a variety of topics ranging from theoretical development to field experiences with group creativity to algorithms and tools to support idea selection. The first paper by Stan examines the effects of group structure and evaluation pressure on group creativity. The author's investigation of 32 teams working on an idea generation task offers support for the notion that teams working under an imposed, functional structure create higher quality results than teams that work under an emergent structure. The author's findings offer insights for design considerations of organizational creative teams. The next paper by Majchrzak, Birnbaum-More, and Johnson presents a qualitative longitudinal study of 31 creative teams. The authors investigated two practices that these teams used to manage their creative process: maintaining engagement and co-creating shared boundary objects. They found that these practices affected the assessment of the teams' innovativeness. Based on the findings, the authors recommend (1) that team members should engage in the co-creation of boundary objects early in the life of the team, and (2) that members need to maintain their engagement with a team, e.g. through the use of collaboration technology, even when they have to focus on other projects. The paper by Kempe, Horton, Buchholz, and Gors, An Optimal Algorithm for Raw Idea Selection under Uncertainty address the challenge of selecting the initial ideas for further development from a large set of raw ideas. The authors propose a ranking algorithm based on pair wise comparisons to be made by knowledgeable decision makers. Through a detailed exposition of the algorithm they show that its use will reduce uncertainty and effectively involve expert knowledge in the idea selection process. The next paper, A Collaborative Algorithm for Computer-Supported Idea Selection in the Front End of Innovation comes from the same research group. In this paper, another selection algorithm is proposed based on a method used in computer-based sorting. This algorithm combines individual and group-based selections to balance speed and simplicity with high quality selections. An experiment showed that the proposed algorithm compares favorably with individual and group methods. Cross-Level Influence of Team Characteristics on Individual Idea Generation in Technology-Supported Teams, by Srinivasan, Maruping, and Robert investigates the use of technology to support idea generation in groups. The authors draw on multilevel theory to understand the interplay between team characteristics and individual goal striving in influencing individual idea generation performance. Their results show that individual goal striving is a stronger predictor of individual idea generation performance in dispersed team contexts compared to co-located team contexts and in larger teams than in smaller teams. The final paper by de Vreede, Boughzala, de Vreede, and Reiter-Palmon, A Model and Exploratory Field Study on Team Creativity proposed a causal model of the antecedents of team creativity that combines individual creativity, knowledge sharing, and the formation of shared mental models. The authors provide anecdotal support for the constructs in their model through a study of an innovation team in a Telecom company."
874405,14040,20561,Introduction to Social Media and E-Business Transformation Minitrack,2012,"Social media are online platforms that facilitate global collaboration and sharing amongst users. New social media applications in e-business and e-commerce appear on a daily basis and result in enormous shocks to the ecosystem of individuals and businesses. This minitrack provides a forum for the exchange of research ideas and best practices related to social media in e-business environments. It also aims to raise awareness in terms of the latest developments in social media, and address the challenges of using social media. This year, eight papers were selected for inclusion in the proceedings. The first paper, Social Media at Socio Systems Inc.: A Socio-technical Systems Analysis of Strategic Action by Don Heath, Rahul Singh and Jai Ganesh proposes an analytic framework to explain organizational strategies for directed action in social media. The next paper by Eric T.K. Lim, Dianne Cyr, and Chee-Wee Tan, Understanding Members' Attachment to Social Networking Sites: An Empirical Investigation of Three Theories, constructs a theoretical model of members' communal attachments within SNSs. The model is then empirically validated via an online survey of 787 active members of SNSs. Drawing from the push-pull-mooring model and uses and gratification theory, Fei Liu and Bo Xiao proposed and empirically tested a theoretical model explaining SNS users' switching behavior in their paper, Do I Switch? Understanding Users' Intention to Switch between Social Network Sites. The fourth paper by Alexander Richte, David Wagner and Andrea Back, Leadership 2.0: Engaging and Supporting Leaders in the Transition Towards a Networked Organization, illustrates the concept of Leadership 2.0 through a series of interviews with the persons who are responsible for the implementation of social software at publicly listed, multinational organizations in Germany. The next paper, Understanding Information Adoption in Online Review Communities: The Role of Herd Factors by Xiao-Liang Shen, Kem Z.K. Zhang, and Sesia J. Zhao, extends prior research on information adoption by incorporating the perspective of herd behavior to explain the influence of massive online reviews in online communities. The research model was empirically tested with 376 users of a Chinese online review community. Impact of Online Firm Generated Content (FGC) on Supply Chain Performance: An Exploratory Empirical Analysis, by Ajaya Swain and Qing Cao uses an advanced sentiment analysis approach to examine the impact of FGC effect on supply chain performance. Information sharing and collaboration are identified as two key FGC elements affecting supply chain performance. Based on an experimental investigation of the judgment ability of 478 subjects, Christian Wagner and Ayoung Suh found that collective size and expertise transfer effects are moderated by task difficulty and are strongest for tasks in a medium difficulty range in their paper, The Wisdom of Crowds: Impact of Collective Size and Expertise Transfer on Collective Performance. The final paper, Assessing the Effects of Navigation Support and Group Structure on Collaborative Online Consumers' Consensus and Mutual Understanding by Yanzhen Yue and Zhenhui (Jack) Jiang, explores an emerging phenomenon of collaborative online shopping by investigating the effects of navigation support and group structure on collaborative online consumers' consensus and mutual understanding. We thank the authors for submitting their work to make this another engaging minitrack. We hope you enjoy the papers and their presentation at the conference."
1109436,14040,20561,Introduction to HCI and Consumer Health Informatics Minitrack,2013,"There is increasing interest in reaching, engaging, and empowering healthcare consumers directly through various forms of information and telecommunication systems. The success of such initiatives largely depend on how healthcare IT is perceived as usable and useful for its intended audience - healthcare professionals and providers, health consumers and patients. Not surprisingly, it becomes increasingly important and relevant to pay attention to HCI issues in healthcare IT. The objective of this Minitrack is to provide an outlet for sharing research that focuses on improving healthcare IT through an HCI lens. This year, the HCI and Consumer Health Informatics Minitrack team selected five papers from a pool of highly competitive submissions. This year's first article, Text Simplification Tools: Using Machine Learning To Discover Features That Identify Difficult Text, by David Kauchak, Obay Mouradi, Chris Pentoney, and Gondy Leroy, focuses on tools for analyzing of text difficulty for health consumers. The paper uses six different machine learning algorithms to predict the difficulty of health texts. Our second article, Alignment of Concerns: A Design Rationale for Patient Participation in eHealth, by Tariq Andersen, Jorgen Bansler, Finn Kensing Jonas Moll, and Karen Nielsen, focuses on divergent concerns of physicians and patients when it comes to illness. The research explores the importance of understanding these differences and provides suggestions for incorporating them in the design of eHealth interfaces. Video Conferencing as a Tool to Enable Participation in Discharge Planning - Experiences from Implementers regarding the Implementation Process, by Malin Hoff Lander, Lina Nilsson, and Christel Borg, focuses on the challenging task of discharge planning. This research emphasizes the concept of time, including consideration of the time needed to prepare and reflect, and it highlights the importance of leadership in framing the meaning of time during this process. Video conferencing is explored as an IS-based approach to addressing related issues. Determinants of Vertical and Horizontal Online Health Information Behavior, by Hye-Jin Paek and Thomas Hove, examines two different types of online health information behavior. The article investigates the association between these online behaviors and demographic, psycho graphic, and lifestyle factors. Magic Mirror for Neurorehabilitation of People with Upper Limb Dysfunction Using Kinect, by Orlando Erazo, Jose Pino, Rosario Pino, and Carmen Fernandez, focuses on rehabilitation. It explains how patients requiring neurorehabilitation can receive training using systems developed for the Microsoft Kinect platform, with a focus on natural user interface systems as used by patients. We are honored by the consistent and strong interest in the HCI and Consumer Health Informatics Minitrack and would like to thank all twenty of this year's contributing authors for submitting their outstanding and interesting research."
2214054,14040,10237,The fifth ACM RecSys workshop on recommender systems and the social web,2012,"The emergence of what is called the social web and the continuing stream of new applications and community-based platforms including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and others had a substantial impact on recommender systems research and practice over the last years in different ways.   First, today's web users are more willing to share more about themselves than before the Web 2.0, thus providing more information sources that can be leveraged in the user modeling and recommendation process. Furthermore, the newly available information sources can not only be used to optimize the recommendations for an individual user, but can also help to identify more general patterns and trends in the behavior of the community that can be exploited by other applications.   Second, personalization, information filtering and recommendation are often the central functionality of many of these social web based applications. On typical social networks, users for example get recommendations for news to read, songs to listen to, groups to join, friends to follow, people to connect or jobs that might be interesting.   These developments lead to different challenges to be addressed in recommender systems research. On the one hand, for example, the question arises of how to effectively combine the huge variety of information sources for improved recommendations. On the other hand, regarding the new opportunities for applying recommender systems in social web environments, in many cases new techniques are required to address the particularities of the domain or to deal with scalability issues.   The ACM RecSys 2014 Workshop on Recommender Systems and the Social Web aims to be a platform for researchers from academia and industry as well as for practitioners to present and discuss the various challenges and possible solutions related to all aspects of social web recommendations. The call for papers correspondingly covered a variety of topics in this area including all sorts of applications of recommender systems technology and their interfaces; collective knowledge creation and topic emergence;context-aware and group recommendation approaches; and case studies and empirical evaluations.   This year's workshop was already the sixth in a series of successful workshops co-located with the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems since 2009. Again, we received several submissions from researchers from academia and industry which were thoroughly reviewed and selected for presentation at the workshop by a program committee of international experts in the field.   The papers submitted to the workshop addressed a number of different topics and put forward novel proposals to build social web recommender system. In the context of applying recommendation technology to information personalization and resource ranking problems in Social Web environments, the submitted papers for example dealt with the problem of ranking community-provided product reviews based on opinion mining or with the recommendation of friends on social networks. As an example of how to leverage Social Web information to build better systems, one of the works proposed to analyze the characteristics of publicly shared music playlists to better understand how future music recommendation systems should be designed. Finally, another contribution from industry addressed challenges and lessons learned when building large-scale collaborative filtering solutions on Social Web platforms in a real-world environment."
615074,14040,20358,Urban: crowdsourcing for the good of London,2013,"For the last few years, we have been studying existing social media sites and created new ones in the context of London. By combining what Twitter users in a variety of London neighborhoods talk about with census data, we showed that neighborhood deprivation was associated (positively and negatively) with use of emotion words (sentiment) [2] and with specific topics [5]. Users in more deprived neighborhoods tweeted about wedding parties, matters expressed in Spanish/Portuguese, and celebrity gossips. By contrast, those in less deprived neighborhoods tweeted about vacations, professional use of social media, environmental issues, sports, and health issues. Also, upon data about 76 million London underground and overground rail journeys, we found that people from deprived areas visited both other deprived areas and prosperous areas, while residents of better-off communities tended to only visit other privileged neighborhoods - suggesting a geographic segregation effect [1, 6]. More recently, we created and launched two crowdsourcing websites. First, we launched urbanopticon.org, which extracts Londoners' mental images of the city. By testing which places are remarkable and unmistakable and which places represent faceless sprawl, we were able to draw the recognizability map of London. We found that areas with low recognizability did not fare any worse on the economic indicators of income, education, and employment, but they did significantly suffer from social problems of housing deprivation, poor living conditions, and crime [4]. Second, we launched urbangems.org. This crowdsources visual perceptions of quiet, beauty and happiness across the city using Google Street View pictures.   The aim is to identify the visual cues that are generally associated with concepts difficult to define such beauty, happiness, quietness, or even deprivation. By using state-of-the-art image processing techniques, we determined the visual cues that make a place appear beautiful, quiet, and happy [3]: the amount of greenery was the most positively associated visual cue with each of three qualities; by contrast, broad streets, fortress-like buildings, and council houses tended to be negatively associated. These two sites offer the ability to conduct specific urban sociological experiments at scale. More generally, this line of work is at the crossroad of two emerging themes in computing research - a crossroad where web science meets the smart city agenda."
1592966,14040,21989,Can a Theory-Informed Interactive Animation Increase Intentions to Engage in Physical Activity in Young People with Asthma?,2014,"Background Participation in regular physical activity improves aerobic fitness and well-being. For people with asthma the benefits also include reduced hospital admissions, absenteeism, medication use, and improved ability to cope with the disease. However, although people with asthma can exercise safely, children and young people with asthma are less likely to be physically active than their peers. Integrating the principles of user-centred design and the MRC Framework for Complex interventions a theoretically-informed interactive animation was developed to encourage young people aged 12–18 years with asthma to engage in physical activity.#N##N#Methods A mixed-methods two stage approach was used. In stage 1 a user group (young people with asthma, parents, health professionals) used online consultation and discussion methods to inform the development of the intervention in a highly iterative manner (modelling). The theoretical basis for the intervention was then refined and converted into a 3D animation with accompanying action plan and volitional help sheet. In stage 2 a web-based Interactive Modelling Experiment evaluated effectiveness in three key areas: knowledge about asthma, inhaler use, and intention to increase physical activity. One-to-one interviews and focus groups were used to evaluate the acceptability of the animation and whether the theoretical basis was effective.#N##N#Results Twenty three people were recruited to the user group. Facilitated by multiple online consultation methods the group was highly engaged throughout. Fifty-three individuals were randomised online to receive the intervention or control; 26 completed follow-up questionnaires (49%). The pilot online experiment supported the evidence base for the intervention but demonstrated that recruitment methods and loss to follow-up need addressed before a future trial. Though not powered to detect an effect on intentions and behaviour, the study revealed an impact on intentions to be active (increase) and on safe inhaler use (decrease). Qualitative feedback was positive across all groups, the intervention being well received and regarded as understandable, meaningful, engaging and potentially very useful within an asthma review.#N##N#Conclusion We have developed a high quality, two part intervention regarded as meaningful, acceptable and potentially useful. Future work is needed to establish whether acceptability levels and perceived effectiveness translate into behaviour change."
1220530,14040,20561,Introduction to IT Innovation for Change in Healthcare Minitrack,2013,"The innovative application of information technologies (IT) in the consumer, clinical, and public health spheres offers the potential for transformational improvements to the healthcare system. Addressing the significant challenge of developing, evaluating, and integrating such innovations requires a systems approach that encompasses the technical and social dimensions, as well as interrelationships across the personal, clinical and public health levels. Vital to the innovative process are electronic information platforms, or cyber infrastructure, that use grid and cloud-based systems for storage, harmonization, access, analysis, and utilization of data. IT innovation in healthcare includes infrastructures to support large data sets/sources as well as emerging data platforms such as the National Health Information Network (NwHIN), Public Health Information Network (PHIN), Cancer Research Network (CRN), and Health Data.gov. IT innovations are also important in health prevention and promotion. health surveillance data, such as the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), are helpful for assessing population trends and informing health-related policy and practice. Such policy and practice applications can be accelerated through applied research, demonstrations, and open innovation developer challenges. Recent developer challenges have provided a key mechanism for applying disparate data sets to advance health promotion and disease prevention, improve health communication and coordination, and expand the use of applications targeting specific populations and health outcomes. This conference mini-track highlights some of the IT innovations in healthcare for population health and health services. It will feature the following papers: A Hybrid Case Based Recommender in mHealth for Smoking Cessation Lessons from an Online Stop-Smoking Intervention: Adaptations for Mobile Implementation Stage-Based mHealth Communication Interventions for HPV Education Towards Next Generation Health Data Exploration: A Data Cube-based Investigation into Population Statistics for Tobacco Towards Systematically-Enabled Next Generation Community Health Information Portals: The PopSciGrid Pilot These research papers address technical, behavioral, social and health issues, with topics ranging from high performance computing topics concerning the extraction of knowledge from various data collections, data acquisition and analysis in a data intensive health science world, and open technological advancements. A particular emphasis in several of the papers relates to the use of large data sets, mhealth, and cyber infrastructure to prevent, monitor, and manage cancer."
1568202,14040,20561,Introduction to Multi-criteria Decision Support Minitrack,2013,"Almost all decisions people make are based on multiple factors or criteria. Decision makers generally pursue multiple, and often conflicting, objectives. A feasible solution that is optimum with respect to all such objectives or decision criteria almost never exists, and a satisfactory compromise solution is generally sought. Multi-criteria decision-making as a field of research deals with problem theory and solution approaches directly involving multiple decision criteria. Information technology and systems may help in dealing with such multi-criteria decision problems. This mini-track focuses on solution approaches, technology, and systems that support decision-making under consideration of multiple decision criteria. This is the third time that this minitrack is included in the HICSS program, and five contributed papers have been accepted. The papers deal with a wide range of decision problems, from software component selection, to recommendations for location-based services. Furthermore, the relevance of trust in multi-criteria decision support, support for research proposal grouping, and skyline operation for multi-criteria decision support are investigated and discussed. Becker, Kraxner, Plangg, and Rauber, in their paper on Improving Decision Support for Software Component Selection through Systematic Cross-referencing and Analysis of Multiple Decision Criteria discuss challenges and opportunities in using particular characteristics of scale in decision scenarios for software component selection. Building on an existing decision support framework, they formalize quality criteria so that they can be cross-referenced and analyzed across scenarios. The paper by Xu, Xu, and Ma, titled An Ontology based Frequent Item set Method to Support Research Proposal Grouping for Research Project Selection, introduces a novel approach to support grouping of research proposals to aid in research project selection. In this approach, first an ontology is constructed to standardize research keywords, and then a frequent item set with various degrees of support is extracted from the research proposals, based on the ontology. In their paper on Success of Multi Criteria Decision Support Systems: The Relevance of Trust, Maida, Maier, Obwegeser, and Stix present a consolidated view on different dimensions of trust and discuss the specific characteristics and dynamics of trust in multi-criteria decision support, based on a multidimensional model. They test the validity of their model with an empirical study, asking participants to complete a survey after using a specially developed decision aide. Emrich, Chapko, and Werth, in their paper on Adaptive, Multi-criteria Recommendations for Location-based Services, analyze influence factors of mobile users for choice of interest. They derive an adaptable ranking function capable of adjusting preference weights on the influence factors, so as to learn from user behavior and evolve the knowledge base. And finally, the paper by Chai, Liu, Yiu, Wang, and Li on A Novel Dynamic Skyline Operation for Multicriteria Decision Support investigates preference relations in skyline operations, a multi-criteria ranking procedure which generally relies on a predetermined preference system. The authors introduce the concept of preference intensity and propose a new decision model, the Tolerant Skyline operation, or T-skyline, which allows for dynamic decision preferences."
153865,14040,21989,Participant Observation and Experiences in the Design for Affectibility,2014,"This paper reports on our experience as Participant Observers in a Project introducing the XO laptop at an elementary school in Brazil. Working together with all members of the school community, we experienced their daily activities with and without technology. Our objective was to build a better un- derstanding of the affective and emotional relationships developed among the community. Moreover, we wanted to understand how users made use and sense of technology. In this article we investigate the presence of affect in our study scenario using the method of Participant Observation. This study was one of the initial steps towards the design of an educational system to be used at elementa- ry schools. Understanding final users of a given technology within their social and cultural con- text, has recognized importance in the process of designing such technology (3,6). Besides the technical comprehension needed, designers need to understand other in- formal aspects of use. In order to consider requirements from levels that go beyond the technical one, it is important that social-cultural strategies are adopted. Such strat- egies should amplify the vision of the general context of the problem and of the stakeholders involved in the solution. In order to construct this social-technical view of the school context and of the educational technologies, we have adopted, among others, Participant Observation (PO) (1) as research method. In this method, the researcher becomes part of a group and he observes behavior as it happens in the real daily settings - and not only the behavior that is described in formal documents. The researcher interacts with the members of the group as if s/he was one of them. At the same time that s/he is inte- racting with the group, the researcher also observes their actions. This allows him/her to construct a view from his/her perspective as the human being that belongs to that group, sharing ideas, sensations and mainly living and understanding the affective relationships. Affect in the educational context has been studied since long. Piaget, for example, argues that for the intellectual development to take place it is necessary to consider also the affective issues and not only the cognitive ones (9, 15). However, designers of systems for the support of learning usually converge their efforts only to the as- pects that facilitate the development of cognition. The aspects that support or facilitate"
199077,14040,21989,CLIM: An Interactive Tabletop for Landscape Modeling,2013,"Abstract. In this paper we describe our development of an interactive touch tabletop user interface for a landscape design tool. The user interface provides a view of the data, which combines the affordances of a multi-touch tabletop dis-play with a vertical screen for real-time feedback. While the table metaphor fits well with the concepts of a top down view of land-scape, approachable from any direction, the board metaphor provides a clear, shared orientation for read-ing output charts. We also present a data model for landscape projects, which provides a knowledge-based approach to design decision making. We discuss the sourcing of the datasets that drive our landscape model. Keywords: Interactive Tabletop, Landscape Design, Knowledge-based Design, Touch User Interface, Campus Information Modeling. 1 Introduction Decision-making for campus landscape planning may take several months, as it re-quires a negotiation among various professionals, converging on a wide range of knowledge, ideas and goals into one concise plan. Within the scope of an intermediate landscape planning scale, we propose a landscape design tool that provides relevant information and real-time feedback during collaborative design-decision-making ses-sions. Our goals are to 1) to facilitate collaboration among experts by providing a tool that includes the professional knowledge of landscape design and real-time evalua-tions and 2) to document the decision-making processes allowing storage and retrieval of alternative design proposals. This paper is focused on describing how the landscape knowledge embedded into the model becomes activated by the user interface (UI) design. ‘Campus Landscape Information Modeling’ (CLIM) facilitates collaboration and rapid design development by addressing important quantitative and qualitative questions to evaluate design proposals and save alternative scenarios (sequence of projects) to compare over time. CLIM visually presents raster-based land use and vector-based landscape elements. Visual information is rendered into a large table to display, representing an aerial view of campus, and a vertical dashboard display net-worked with informative charts that update in real-time (Figure1a).

529970,14040,20332,STEP: A Scalable Testing and Evaluation Platform,2014,"The emergence of online crowdsourcing sites, online work platforms, and even Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), has created an increasing need for reliably evaluating the skills of the participating users in a scalable way. Many platforms already allow users to take online tests and verify their skills, but the existing approaches face many problems. First of all, cheating is very common in online testing without supervision, as the test questions often “leak” and become easily available online together with the answers. Second, technical skills, such as programming, require the tests to be frequently updated in order to reflect the current state-of-the-art. Third, there is very limited evaluation of the tests themselves, and how effectively they measure the skill that the users are tested for. In this paper, we present a Scalable Testing and Evaluation Platform (STEP), that allows continuous generation and evaluation of test questions. STEP leverages already available content, on Question Answering sites such as Stack Overflow and re-purposes these questions to generate tests. The system utilizes a crowdsourcing component for the editing of the questions, while it uses automated techniques for identifying promising QA threads that can be successfully re-purposed for testing. This continuous question generation decreases the impact of cheating and also creates questions that are closer to the real problems that the skill holder is expected to solve in real life. STEP also leverages the use of Item Response Theory to evaluate the quality of the questions. We also use external signals about the quality of the workers. These identify the questions that have the strongest predictive ability in distinguishing workers that have the potential to succeed in the online job marketplaces. Existing approaches contrast in using only internal consistency metrics to evaluate the questions. Finally, our system employs an automatic “leakage detector” that queries the Internet to identify leaked versions of our questions. We then mark these questions as “practice only,” effectively removing them from the pool of questions used for evaluation. Our experimental evaluation shows that our system generates questions of comparable or higher quality compared to existing tests, with a cost of approximately 3−5 dollars per question, which is lower than the cost of licensing questions from existing test banks."
993013,14040,9896,Information and Expertise Sharing in Inter-Organizational Crisis Management,2014,"Emergency or crisis management, as is well-attested, is a complex management problem. A variety of agencies need to collaborate and coordinate in real-time and with an urgency that is not always present in other domains. It follows that accurate information of varying kinds (e.g. geographical and weather conditions; available skills and expertises; state-of-play; current dispositions and deployments) needs to be made available in a timely fashion to the organizations and individuals who need it. By definition, this information will come from a number of sources both within and across organizations. Large-scale events in particular necessitate collaboration with other organizations. Of course, plans and processes exist to deal with such events but the number of dynamically changing factors as well as the high number of heterogeneous organizations and the high degree of interdependency involved make it impossible to plan for all contingencies. A degree of ongoing improvisation, which typically occurs by means of a variety of information and expertise sharing practices, therefore becomes necessary. This, however, faces many challenges, such as different organizational cultures, distinct individual and coordinative work practices and discrete information systems. Our work entails an examination of the practices of information and expertise sharing, and the obstacles to it, in inter-organizational crisis management. We conceive of this as a design case study, such that we examine a problem area and its scope; conduct detailed enquiries into practice in that area, and provide design recommendations for implementation and evaluation. First, we will present the results of an empirical study of collaboration practices between organizations and public authorities with security responsibilities such as the police, fire departments, public administration and electricity network operators, mainly in scenarios of medium to large power outages in Germany. Based on these results, we will describe a concept, which was designed, implemented and evaluated as a system prototype, in two iterations. While the first iteration focuses on situation assessment, the second iteration also includes inter-organizational collaboration functionalities. Based on the findings of our evaluations with practitioners, we will discuss how to support collaboration with a particular focus on information and expertise sharing."
1417384,14040,9896,Knowledge Management in Practice: A Special Issue,2012,"Organizations of different kinds, from structured companies up to social networks or virtual communities, are becoming increasingly aware of the need to collect, organize, mobilize, and increase the expertise and knowledge which characterize their ability to stay alive, adapt, and evolve in a turbulent context. Knowledge Management (KM) is the current term for the different organizational and technological approaches to answer this need. KM, from a management perspective, is an attempt to rationalize and manage the vast amounts of formal and informal knowledge that any organization, especially large companies, has. KM, from a practice perspective, investigates the everyday practices that lead to organizationally situated use of that formal and informal knowledge (Ackerman et al. 2008). While the KM discourse has long been focusing on opportunities to externalize and represent knowledge in artifacts, the identification of knowledgeable actors and the support of social networks as well as their interactions with artifact becomes highly relevant in a practice perspective (Ackerman et al. 2003). CSCW has examined knowledge and information in organizations from its very beginnings. In more recent years, the CSCW community has examined KM per se. This manifested itself in asking for applied research in the KM practices of real organizations instead of blindly following media hype—the critical realism stance that Robert Kling advocated over the technological utopianism of the media and technology promoters. In addition, the KM investigation in CSCW has followed CSCW’s notable interest in discussing and detailing the interrelationships between technological and organizational innovations, and CSCWas a community has taken on the task of considering those interrelationships critically. This views KM largely as a matter of socio-technical design—and a difficult design problem at that. This special issue adheres to these positions. Our aim was to collect articles reporting on knowledge management in action. We wanted to further the discussion of the issues of KM through the kinds of fine-grained ethnography-based investigations found in this community and this journal. Specifically, we wanted ethnography-based or other interpretivist work that confronted and learned from real organizational situations. We wanted these papers to highlight the problems, requirements, tradeoffs, and technical solutions in KM that can be derived only from field-based research."
140755,14040,21989,Controlling Interaction in Multilingual Conversation,2013,"The present approach targets to provide a framework for facilitating multilingual interaction in online business meetings with an agenda as well as in similar applications in the service sector where there is a less task-oriented form of interaction. A basic problem to be addressed is the control of the topics covered during the interaction and the expression of opinion. In the proposed template-based approach, the System is proposed to act as a mediator to control the dialog flow, within the modeled framework of the sublanguage-specific and pragmatically related design. The domain of the proposed framework concerns routine business meetings via Skype with an agenda, namely standard, controlled conversation. This domain includes services requiring a less task-oriented form of interaction as well as statement of sentiment or opinion. The proposed framework is not recommended for business meetings concerning negotiations or business deals. Conditions involve multilingual conversation with speakers of less spoken languages and an average or less than aver- age knowledge of English. The interaction involves Skype meetings with or without translated subtitles. Subtitles (text messages) are combined with spoken input. Users may speak at the same time while the corresponding, similar or even different text message is generated. The communicating parties have access to prosodic and paralinguistic information, such as tone of voice, as well as facial expressions and other paralinguistic elements. The flow of the conversation can be checked by the System or the User, as well as the topics covered. This is achieved by intervening messages by the System, appear- ing in the screen of the interface. Furthermore, additional free input from the User's utterances may be processed after the interaction. Spoken interaction is processed with the use of Interlinguas (we propose the use of Simple Interlinguas - SILTs) (8) generated simultaneously with translated text messages chosen by the User. The proposed service may be regarded as an alternative to email in routine business meetings, allowing face-to-face interaction and feed-back from paralinguistic elements, such as gestures, facial expression and tone of voice. Furthermore, in multi- lingual applications involving communication with a standard agenda, the proposed approach may be adaptable and reusable in respect to several languages."
1009922,14040,10237,Building industrial-scale real-world recommender systems,2012,"In 2006, Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, a machine learning and data mining competition for movie rating prediction. We offered $1 million to whoever improved the accuracy of our existing system called Cinematch by 10%. We conducted this competition to find new ways to improve the recommendations we provide to our members, which is a key part of our business. However, we had to come up with a proxy question that was easier to evaluate and quantify: the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predicted rating. A year into the competition, the Korbell team won the first Progress Prize with an 8.43% improvement. They reported more than 2000 hours of work in order to come up with the final combination of 107 algorithms that gave them this prize. And, they gave us the source code. We looked at the two underlying algorithms with the best performance in the ensemble. To put these algorithms to use, we had to work to overcome some limitations, for instance that they were built to handle 100 million ratings, instead of the more than 5 billion that we have, and that they were not built to adapt as members added more ratings. But once we overcame those challenges, we put the two algorithms into production, where they are still used as part of our recommendation engine.   You might be wondering what happened with the final Grand Prize ensemble that won the $1M two years later. This is a truly impressive compilation and culmination of years of work, blending hundreds of predictive models to finally cross the finish line. We evaluated some of the new methods offline but the additional accuracy gains that we measured did not seem to justify the engineering effort needed to bring them into a production environment.   This example highlights the fact that, besides improving offline metrics such as the RMSE, recommender systems need to take into account other practical issues such as scalability or deployment. In this tutorial, we go over some of those practical issues that many times are as important as the theory, if not more, in order to build an industrial-scale real-world recommender system."
201038,14040,21989,An Empathic Approach in Assistive Technology to Provide Job Accommodations for Disabilities,2011,"When the psychologist Abraham Maslow first defined the five levels of human need in 1943, people started to realise how human needs should be fulfilled and many products have since been designed to fulfill these needs. Many researches have shown that the desire to achieve a higher level of need is no different between normal people and disabled people. However, social benefits only support a disabled person with their basic needs. To help them achieve a higher level of need, for them, finding a suitable job is the best way forward.An appropriately designed assistive technology (AT) allows the user to be more efficient at work, prevent them suffering occupational injury and enjoy a safe and comfortable work environment. It could be a good tool to help them reach their psychological needs, but designing an appropriate AT requires a designer with a high level of professional knowledge in AT, an understanding of the subject's abilities and being able to realise the task and environment that the subject needs to work in, all of which involve long term training. Additionally, the majority of designers are healthy people; it is very difficult for a healthy person to have the ability to understand the difficulties of a disabled subject, especially young designers. In this research, the researcher used a spinal injured lottery seller in Taiwan as the subject. The researcher observed and analysed his tasks and environment, collected professional suggestions from experts and, based on the user-centred design theory, compared the physical differences between the subject and healthy designers. Additionally, the results were applied to a design and an empathy tool was produced, when wearing it would allow the designers to empathise with the inconvenience of the physical conditions of the subject. The empathy tool was tested and evaluated by various product designers. The researcher designed a scenarios process and asked his participants to practice with it. The result showed that although the suit could not simulate the psychological conditions of the target user, it was, however, successful in mimicking the physical conditions of the subject and allowed the designers to realise the difficulties and problems of the subject through the simulation process. Thus, these experiences were transformed into design knowledge when designing assistive technology."
1589441,14040,20561,Barriers to Increasing the Role of Demand Resources in Electricity Markets,2014,"The objective of this paper is to show that customers can benefit from a smart grid if they become more active participants in electricity markets by 1) relying more on deferrable demand (e.g. electric vehicles and augmenting space conditioning with thermal storage) to shift demand away from peak periods and buy more electricity when prices are low at night, and 2) selling ancillary services such as ramping capacity to mitigate the inherent uncertainty of wind generation. These two factors, coupled with the lower operating cost of wind generation compared to conventional generation from fossil fuels, have the potential for reducing the cost of electricity to customers. However, these benefits will not be realized unless the rates charged to customers reflect the true costs of supply. This paper compares how the bills charged to different types of customer are affected by different rate structures with and without the correct economic incentives. The main savings in operating cost come from the displacement of conventional generation by wind generation, and the main savings in capital cost come from reducing the amount of installed conventional generating capacity needed to maintain System Adequacy by 1) reducing the peak system load, and 2) by using deferrable demand to provide ramping services and reduce the amount of conventional generating capacity needed for operating reserves. A new stochastic form of multi-period Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow is applied in a simulation using a reduction of the North Eastern Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) network for a representative summer day. This model treats potential wind generation as a stochastic input and determines the amount of conventional generating capacity needed to maintain reliability endogenously. The analysis assumes implicitly that all deferrable demand at a node is managed by an aggregator. If the rates are structured with the correct economic incentives (i.e. real-time nodal prices for energy, a demand charge determined by the demand during system peak periods, and compensation for providing ramping services), the results show that 1) the economic benefits for customers with thermal storage are substantial, and 2) the main benefits for customers with electric vehicles (without V2G capabilities in this application) come from buying less gasoline. In contrast, if customers pay conventional rates with a fixed price for energy and no demand charge, the economic incentives are perverse and customers with deferrable demand pay more and customers with no deferrable demand pay less."

1878,14040,21989,Humanization of Work and Environmental Protection in Activity of Enterprise,2014,"Abstract. Industrial production is an integrated process where a human plays the most crucial and vital role. The employees’ ability to perform tasks at shift contributes to a significant loading of health. Thus, providing them good work-ing conditions is necessary. In order to achieve it, safe and environmental friendly systems of work should be assured. In this paper the results of the sur-vey considering safety work and working conditions in Polish enterprises are shown. They indicate that respect for safety and health regulations is essential and in most cases poor working conditions are due to the lack of safety supervi-sion and control. Keywords: green job, humanization, safety, working conditions. 1 Introduction Dynamic and difficult to anticipation changes, which appear in the surrounding of enterprises, require continuous acquiring and actualization of knowledge which is related to production or service activities. Fast and flexible reaction to these changes in the surrounding is the basis for survival and shaping competitive advantage of the enterprise. One of the most important factors of the competitiveness of enterprises is quality of their products and services offered on national and international markets. On the other hand, quality does not only decide about efficiency and productiveness of the enterprise and its success. It is a human who plays a decisive role in the realization of all processes. The results of investigations conducted in Polish and foreign enterprises confirm the existence of huge reserves connected with broadly-taken humanization of work environment and embedded in so called human factor (Butlewski & Tytyk, 2012). However, in order to benefit from this potential it is necessary to apply solutions en-compassing humanization aspects, demands and ergonomic requirements in design work processes (Kawecka-Endler & Mrugalska, 2011; Kawecka-Endler & Mrugalska, 2012). The design processes should be integrated with the whole production (or service) activity of the enterprise. Achieving this goal guarantees several benefits:"
1741586,14040,9896,Enabling Large-Scale Deliberation Using Attention-Mediation Metrics,2012,"Humanity now finds itself faced with a range of highly complex and controversial challenges--such as climate change, the spread of disease, international security, scientific collaborations, product development, and so on--that call upon us to bring together large numbers of experts and stakeholders to deliberate collectively on a global scale. Collocated meetings can however be impractically expensive, severely limit the concurrency and thus breadth of interaction, and are prone to serious dysfunctions such as polarization and hidden profiles. Social media such as email, blogs, wikis, chat rooms, and web forums provide unprecedented opportunities for interacting on a massive scale, but have yet to realize their potential for helping people deliberate effectively, typically generating poorly-organized, unsystematic and highly redundant contributions of widely varying quality. Large-scale argumentation systems represent a promising approach for addressing these challenges, by virtue of providing a simple systematic structure that radically reduces redundancy and encourages clarity. They do, however, raise an important challenge. How can we ensure that the attention of the deliberation participants is drawn, especially in large complex argument maps, to where it can best serve the goals of the deliberation? How can users, for example, find the issues they can best contribute to, assess whether some intervention is needed, or identify the results that are mature and ready to harvest? Can we enable, for large-scale distributed discussions, the ready understanding that participants typically have about the progress and needs of small-scale, collocated discussions?. This paper will address these important questions, discussing (1) the strengths and limitations of current deliberation technologies, (2) how argumentation technology can help address these limitations, and (3) how we can use attention-mediation metrics to enhance the effectiveness of large-scale argumentation-based deliberations."
28409,14040,21989,The Unadorned Desk: Exploiting the Physical Space around a Display as an Input Canvas,2013,"In everyday office work, people smoothly use the space on their physical desks to work with documents of interest, and to keep tools and mate- rials nearby for easy use. In contrast, the limited screen space of computer dis- plays imposes interface constraints. Associated material is placed off-screen (i.e., temporarily hidden) and requires extra work to access (window switching, menu selection) or crowds and competes with the work area (e.g., palettes and icons). This problem is worsened by the increasing popularity of small displays such as tablets and laptops. To mitigate this problem, we investigate how we can exploit an unadorned physical desk space as an additional input canvas. With minimal augmentation, our Unadorned Desk detects coarse hovering over and touching of discrete areas ('items') within a given area on an otherwise reg- ular desk, which is used as input to the desktop computer. We hypothesize that people's spatial memory will let them touch particular desk locations without looking. In contrast to other augmented desks, our system provides optional feedback of touches directly on the computer's screen. We conducted a user study to understand how people make use of this input space. Participants freely placed and retrieved items onto/from the desk. We found that participants or- ganize items in a grid-like fashion for easier access later on. In a second expe- riment, participants had to retrieve items from a predefined grid. When only few (large) items are located in the area, participants were faster without feed- back and there was (surprisingly) no difference in error rates with or without feedback. As the item number grew (i.e., items shrank to fit the area), partici- pants increasingly relied on feedback to minimize errors - at the cost of speed."
1058666,14040,20561,"Grid Modernization: Seamless Integration of Protection, Optimization and Control",2014,"The objectives of smart grid and grid modernization are to increase automation and seamlessly integrate data, models, protection, optimization and control of the power grid. This effort is affected by technological advances. One such technology is the numerical relay which has increased its domination to the point that today has almost completely displaced electromechanical and solid state relays and the most recent technology of merging units that has separated the data acquisition function from protective relays and SCADA systems. The capabilities of the numerical relays are not fully utilized today, specifically, by and large, they simply mimic the logics that were developed for the electromechanical relays but with much more flexibility. Recent developments towards substation automation are utilizing the numerical relays for SCADA, communications and in general an integrated system for protection and control. These approaches indicate the recognition that numerical relays offer much more than simply mimicking protection functions of the past. They also offer the ability to form the basic infrastructure towards a fully automated power system, the subject of this paper. In previous work, we presented a new protection scheme that is a generalization of differential protection. The approach is based on dynamic state estimation. Specifically, the protection scheme is based on continuously monitoring terminal voltages and currents of the component and other possible quantities such as tap setting, temperature, etc. as appropriate for the component under protection. The monitored data are utilized in a dynamic state estimation that continuously provides the dynamic state of the component. The dynamic state is then used to determine the health of the component. Tripping or no tripping is decided on the basis of the health of the component. The present paper takes the above concept one step further. Using the dynamic state estimation of a protection zone as the basic technology, it builds an integrated automation system that performs the protection functions, validates models, transmits the models to the control center, integrates monitoring and control, enables optimization and provides automated disturbance playback capabilities. The system provides the infrastructure and real time models for any application along the spatial extend of the power system."
1585115,14040,20796,Instant foodie: predicting expert ratings from grassroots,2013,"Consumer review sites and recommender systems typically rely on a large volume of user-contributed ratings, which makes rating acquisition an essential component in the design of such systems. User ratings are then summarized to provide an aggregate score representing a popular evaluation of an item. An inherent problem in such summarization is potential bias due to raters self-selection and heterogeneity in terms of experience, tastes and rating scale interpretation. There are two major approaches to collecting ratings, which have different advantages and disadvantages. One is to allow a large number of volunteers to choose and rate items directly (a method employed by e.g. Yelp and Google Places). Alternatively, a panel of raters may be maintained and invited to rate a predefined set of items at regular intervals (such as in Zagat Survey). The latter approach arguably results in more consistent reviews and reduced selection bias, however, at the expense of much smaller coverage (fewer rated items).   In this paper, we examine the two different approaches to collecting user ratings of restaurants and explore the question of whether it is possible to reconcile them. Specifically, we study the problem of inferring the more calibrated Zagat Survey ratings (which we dub 'expert ratings') from the user-generated ratings ('grassroots') in Google Places. To that effect, we employ latent factor models and provide a probabilistic treatment of the ordinal rankings. We can predict Zagat Survey ratings accurately from ad hoc user-generated ratings by joint optimization on two datasets. We analyze the resulting model, and find that users become more discerning as they submit more ratings. We also describe an approach towards cross-city recommendations, answering questions such as 'What is the equivalent of the Per Se restaurant in Chicago'?"
213233,14040,21989,Sound Design in Interactive Environments,2014,"As message transmitters, all acoustic signals - natural or constructed - are perceived as having specific information. However, a little amount of research has been directed to the study of what is heard by people about the world around them and how it occurs, especially with regard to its interrelationship with interactive environments applications. Based on the universe of hypermedia, this study aims to explain the main applications of sound in a broad perspective with regard to its features of content, form and function, which are manifested through the use of dialogue, ambience and sound effects. When hearing, memories are aroused and their meanings associated with the auditory event. Jekosch (2006) suggests that the listener has an acquisition system of sounds and meaning, or, in technical terms, a lexical set of sounds. This lexical set contains invariant auditory resources, such as the shape of the sound (like the typical sound caused by a hammer hitting metal), its contents of experience (strong sound of something crashing into another), and their inter-relationships of functions (use the blow of the hammer to forge the metal). These lexical items are important aspects of information that is used in order to obtain the associative meaning of the corresponding sound. Based on the individual stored meanings, a satisfactory correspondence between perception data, experience data and expectation will attach meaning to the sound event. So, to hear certain types of sound, systems of meanings are activated and used as a reference, being the auditory stimulus a signal carrier that associates these memorized events. As a result, a meaning is assigned to the sound stimulus. Such associations and meanings are also activated when an unknown sound is heard: the perceived characteristics of what is heard are correlated with an internal system of meanings, that contains all that was experienced by the individual, and this new information is then seized. A significant scope for improvement in the field of sound design is given when the sound is analyzed in a broad perspective with regard to its features of content, form and function. The central question, then, focuses on pointing out how listeners process the acoustic events when theyre taken as information carriers. This question can be systematically examined making specific use of modern paradigms of psychoacoustics"
1193902,14040,20358,Build your own music recommender by modeling internet radio streams,2012,"In the Internet music scene, where recommendation technology is key for navigating huge collections, large market players enjoy a considerable advantage. Accessing a wider pool of user feedback leads to an increasingly more accurate analysis of user tastes, effectively creating a rich get richer effect. This work aims at significantly lowering the entry barrier for creating music recommenders, through a paradigm coupling a public data source and a new collaborative filtering (CF) model. We claim that Internet radio stations form a readily available resource of abundant fresh human signals on music through their playlists, which are essentially cohesive sets of related tracks. In a way, our models rely on the knowledge of a diverse group of experts in lieu of the commonly used wisdom of crowds. Over several weeks, we aggregated publicly available playlists of thousands of Internet radio stations, resulting in a dataset encompassing millions of plays, and hundreds of thousands of tracks and artists. This provides the large scale ground data necessary to mitigate the cold start problem of new items at both mature and emerging services.   Furthermore, we developed a new probabilistic CF model, tailored to the Internet radio resource. The success of the model was empirically validated on the collected dataset. Moreover, we tested the model at a cross-source transfer learning manner -- the same model trained on the Internet radio data was used to predict behavior of Yahoo! Music users. This demonstrates the ability to tap the Internet radio signals in other music recommendation setups. Based on encouraging empirical results, our hope is that the proposed paradigm will make quality music recommendation accessible to all interested parties in the community."
1185488,14040,8927,On discovering non-obvious recommendations: using unexpectedness and neighborhood selection methods in collaborative filtering systems,2014,"This paper proposes a number of studies in order to move the field of recommender systems beyond the traditional paradigm and the classical perspective of rating prediction accuracy. We contribute to existing helpful but less explored recommendation strategies and propose new approaches targeting to more useful recommendations for both users and businesses. Working toward this direction, we discuss the studies we have conducted so far and present our future research plans. The overall goal of this research program is to expand our focus from even more accurate rating predictions toward a more holistic experience for the users, by providing them with non-obvious but high quality recommendations and avoiding the over-specialization and concentration bias problems. In particular, we propose a new probabilistic neighborhood-based method as an improvement of the standard $k$-nearest neighbors approach, alleviating some of the most common problems of collaborative filtering recommender systems, based on classical metrics of dispersion and diversity as well as some newly proposed metrics. Furthermore, we propose a concept of unexpectedness in recommender systems and operationalize it by suggesting various mechanisms for specifying the expectations of the users and proposing a recommendation method for providing the users with unexpected but high quality personalized recommendations that fairly match their interests. Besides, in order to generate utility-based recommendations for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that better serve the educational needs of students, we study the satisfaction of users with online courses vis-a-vis student retention. Finally, we summarize the conclusions of the conducted studies, discuss the limitations of our work and also outline the managerial implications of the proposed stream of research."
1071238,14040,20411,Opportunity model for e-commerce recommendation: right product; right time,2013,"Most of existing e-commerce recommender systems aim to recommend the right product to a user, based on whether the user is likely to purchase or like a product. On the other hand, the effectiveness of recommendations also depends on the time of the recommendation. Let us take a user who just purchased a laptop as an example. She may purchase a replacement battery in 2 years (assuming that the laptop's original battery often fails to work around that time) and purchase a new laptop in another 2 years. In this case, it is not a good idea to recommend a new laptop or a replacement battery right after the user purchased the new laptop. It could hurt the user's satisfaction of the recommender system if she receives a potentially right product recommendation at the wrong time. We argue that a system should not only recommend the most relevant item, but also recommend at the right time.   This paper studies the new problem: how to recommend the right product at the right time? We adapt the proportional hazards modeling approach in survival analysis to the recommendation research field and propose a new  opportunity model  to explicitly incorporate time in an e-commerce recommender system. The new model estimates the joint probability of a user making a follow-up purchase of a particular product at a particular time. This joint purchase probability can be leveraged by recommender systems in various scenarios, including the zero-query pull-based recommendation scenario (e.g. recommendation on an e-commerce web site) and a proactive push-based promotion scenario (e.g. email or text message based marketing). We evaluate the opportunity modeling approach with multiple metrics. Experimental results on a data collected by a real-world e-commerce website(shop.com) show that it can predict a user's follow-up purchase behavior at a particular time with descent accuracy. In addition, the opportunity model significantly improves the conversion rate in pull-based systems and the user satisfaction/utility in push-based systems."
114792,14040,21989,A Teacher Model to Speed Up the Process of Building Courses,2013,"Building a new course is a complex task for teachers: the entire process requires different steps, starting with the concept map building and ending with the delivery of the learning objects to stu- dents through a learning management system. Teachers have to spend a lot of time to build or to retrieve the right learning material from lo- cal databases or from specialized repositories on the web. Consequently, having a system supporting this phase is a very important challenge, con- sidering that each teacher expresses her own pedagogy as well. Here we propose a novel Teacher Model that helps teachers to build new courses effectively. The model is based both on a didactic semantic network con- taining concepts and learning material and on Teaching Styles as pro- posed in the literature by Grasha. This framework gives teachers the possibility to share their teaching experience as well. A first experimen- tation of the system gives positive results. 1 Motivations and Goals Quality of teaching is undoubtedly one of the most important ingredients for student learning and consequently for a course of success independently from the delivery platform. The process of preparing a new course is a very complex process where the teacher is involved in several tasks such as: i)building the concept map; ii)retrieving learning material from some didactic repositories or building a new one; iii) building a didactic storyboard; iv)delivering the course on a suitable didactic environment (10,9,5,14). Our research addresses the course building process, in order to give teachers an instrument to speed up the overall process, decreasing their working load and increasing the quality of their didac- tic material. We propose a personalized approach to the course building process, where a model of the teacher, is based both on the Teaching Experience (TE) and on Teaching Styles (TS). The TS is based on the Grasha TS model (6), com- posed of five different dimensions while the TE is a dynamic framework which changes with the teacher's didactic choices, i.e., with her teaching experience and teaching styles. Such a semantic network is a directed graph composed by those concepts and by those learning materials used by teachers of a community to"

This paper focuses on the disruption caused by interruptions and presents a disruption mediating approach for balancing the negative effects of interruptions with respect to the benefits of interruptions relevant to the user goals. Our work shows how Disruption Manager utilizing context and relationships to user goals and tasks can assess when and how to present interruptions in order to reduce their disruptiveness.#R##N##R##N#The Disruption Management Framework was created to take into consideration motivations that influence people's interruption decision process. The framework predicts the effects from interruptions using a three-layer software architecture: a knowledge layer including information about topics related to the ongoing activity, an intermediate layer including summarized information about the user tasks and their stages, and a low level layer including implicit low granularity information, such as mouse movement, context switching and windowing activity to support fail-safe disruption management when no other contextual information is available. The manager supports implicit monitoring of ongoing behaviors and categorizing possible disruptive outcome given the user and system state. The manager monitors actions and uses common sense reasoning in its model to compare communication stream topics with topics files that are active on the desktop.#R##N##R##N#Experiments demonstrate that disruption manager significantly reduces the impact of interruptions and improve people's performance in a multiapplication desktop scenario with email and instant messaging. In a complex order taking activity, disruption manager yielded a 26% performance increase for tasks prioritized as being important and a 32.5% increase for urgent tasks. The evaluation shows that the modulated interruptions did not distract or troubled users. Further, subjects using the Disruption Manager were 5 times more likely to respond effectively to instant messages."
1584980,14040,20561,Introduction to the Transformational Government Minitrack,2012,"Initially, e-Government was considered a solely technical phenomenon. However, in the last few years, research on this topic clearly showed its multidimensional nature and identified the importance of acknowledging strategic, political, managerial, organizational, and external relationship factors to understand and explain the transformation of government enabled by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). This mini-track examines the complexity of effectively managing e-Government and its transformational potential. Increasingly, this involves inter-organizational collaboration and the management of relationships with citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders. Transformational government is a rapidly evolving concept focused on ICT-enabled fundamental changes in the structure, functions, processes, and external relationships of government. Although the meaning of transformed government is still unclear, practical examples of transformational government involve innovative forms of public service provision through a variety of digital channels, new forms of back-office integration and joint-up government, digital engagement using social media, and new forms of open government and open public data. The aims for governments around the world to achieve transformational government are multiple and varied: they include increased efficiency, enhanced effectiveness, better coordination across government, good governance through increased transparency and accountability, increased citizen trust or even empowerment, improved public decision-making, and modernizing government. This mini-track is one of the key international platforms at which the transformational aspects of e-Government, as well as their implications for government, citizens and society, are being discussed from a multidisciplinary perspective. It welcomes papers with an empirical, theoretical, or conceptual contribution that show the importance of strategic, political, institutional, managerial, organizational, and democratic factors in managing transformational e-Government. This year's mini-track attracted seven paper submissions from which three were selected for presentation at the conference."
2316004,14040,422,LCARS: a location-content-aware recommender system,2013,"Newly emerging location-based and event-based social network services provide us with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their activity history. A user can only visit a limited number of venues/events and most of them are within a limited distance range, so the user-item matrix is very sparse, which creates a big challenge for traditional collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. The problem becomes more challenging when people travel to a new city where they have no activity history.   In this paper, we propose LCARS, a location-content-aware recommender system that offers a particular user a set of venues (e.g., restaurants) or events (e.g., concerts and exhibitions) by giving consideration to both personal interest and local preference. This recommender system can facilitate people's travel not only near the area in which they live, but also in a city that is new to them. Specifically, LCARS consists of two components: offline modeling and online recommendation. The offline modeling part, called LCA-LDA, is designed to learn the interest of each individual user and the local preference of each individual city by capturing item co-occurrence patterns and exploiting item contents. The online recommendation part automatically combines the learnt interest of the querying user and the local preference of the querying city to produce the top- k  recommendations. To speed up this online process, a scalable query processing technique is developed by extending the classic Threshold Algorithm (TA). We evaluate the performance of our recommender system on two large-scale real data sets, DoubanEvent and Foursquare. The results show the superiority of LCARS in recommending spatial items for users, especially when traveling to new cities, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency."
1048502,14040,10237,The recommender problem revisited,2014,"In 2006, Netflix announced a $1M prize competition to advance recommendation algorithms. The recommendation problem was simplified as the accuracy in predicting a user rating measured by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). While that formulation helped get the attention of the research community in the area, it may have put an excessive focus on what is simply one of the many possible approaches to recommendations.   In this tutorial we will describe different components of modern recommender systems such as: personalized ranking, similarity, explanations, context-awareness, or search as recommendation. We will use the Netflix use case as a driving example of a prototypical industrial-scale recommender system that has evolved from focusing on rating prediction to full page optimization. We will also review the usage of modern algorithmic approaches that include algorithms such as Factorization Machines [9], Restricted Boltzmann Machines [10], SimRank [7], Deep Neural Networks, or Listwise Learning-to-rank [6, 12, 11].   The original recommendation problem was formulated around the existence of explicit user ratings. However, recommender systems can be built using different kinds of data including implicit behavioral data, social connections, or demographics. In this tutorial we will review the usage of different data types and discuss what the availability of Big Data has brought into the research area.   Finally, and also related to the availability of large quantities of data, we will talk about how system and architectural decisions play a role in understanding the recommender problem.   This tutorial is in part based on recent publications by the author [5, 1, 8, 2, 4, 3]."
729189,14040,11317,Real-time captioning by groups of non-experts,2012,"Real-time captioning provides deaf and hard of hearing people immediate access to spoken language and enables participation in dialogue with others. Low latency is critical because it allows speech to be paired with relevant visual cues. Currently, the only reliable source of real-time captions are expensive stenographers who must be recruited in advance and who are trained to use specialized keyboards. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is less expensive and available on-demand, but its low accuracy, high noise sensitivity, and need for training beforehand render it unusable in real-world situations. In this paper, we introduce a new approach in which groups of non-expert captionists (people who can hear and type) collectively caption speech in real-time on-demand. We present Legion:Scribe, an end-to-end system that allows deaf people to request captions at any time. We introduce an algorithm for merging partial captions into a single output stream in real-time, and a captioning interface designed to encourage coverage of the entire audio stream. Evaluation with 20 local participants and 18 crowd workers shows that non-experts can provide an effective solution for captioning, accurately covering an average of 93.2% of an audio stream with only 10 workers and an average per-word latency of 2.9 seconds. More generally, our model in which multiple workers contribute partial inputs that are automatically merged in real-time may be extended to allow dynamic groups to surpass constituent individuals (even experts) on a variety of human performance tasks."
2654844,14040,21989,Performance and Comfort When Using Motion-Controlled Tools in Complex Tasks,2011,"Abstract. The use of interaction tools in modern work often challenges the human motor system, especially when these tools create awkward postures and discomfort (e.g., mouse arm syndrome). The question whether the trackball is a serious alternative to the mouse was evaluated in this experimental study in terms of motor performance, usability and comfort. In an applied pointing-selection task we varied gain and task difficulty. Results showed a considerably stronger impact of gain and task difficulty on the trackball than on the mouse, especially for the high gain trackball performance slowed down. Second, usability ratings were significantly better for the mouse than for the trackball (independent of the experimental condition). Finally, while the discomfort after mouse usage rose notably, trackball usage led to an even bigger increase in perceived discomfort. Keywords: Human-computer interaction, input devices, Fitts’ Law, repetitive strain injury. 1 Introduction The mouse is still the most widely used input device [1] since it is regarded as fast, precise and easy to handle. However, a rising amount of users experiences discomfort of the upper extremities. These mouse related repetitive strain injuries (RSI) are caused by repetitive movements, extreme wrist positions as well as high muscular load and tension [2, 3]. In recent years, manufactures of input devices have reacted to the rise of mouse-related RSI by developing alternatives considered to be less hazardous concerning muscular strain. Especially the thumb-controlled trackball has been advertized as being a healthy alternative by minimizing strain on the hand, wrist and arm. However, little is know about its efficiency, accuracy and muscular load. Furthermore, no analysis evaluates the trackball as a serious alternative to the mouse by comparing performance measures so far. Accordingly, the present study aims to provide a detailed analysis of motor performance and comfort of trackball and mouse and thus to evaluate the proposed ergonomic advantage of the trackball."
2139238,14040,20332,Saving Money While Polling with InterPoll Using Power Analysis,2014,"Crowd-sourcing is increasingly being used for large-scale polling and surveys. Companies such as SurveyMonkey and Instant.ly make crowd-sourced surveys commonplace by making the crowd accessible through an easy-to-use UI with easy to retrieve results. Further, they do so with a relatively low latency by having dedicated crowds at their disposal. In this paper we argue that the ease with which polls can be created conceals an inherent difficulty: the survey maker does not know how many workers to hire for their survey. Asking too few may lead to samples sizes that “do not look impressive enough.” Asking too many clearly involves spending extra money, which can quickly become costly. Existing crowdsourcing platforms do not provide help with this, neither, one can argue, do they have any incentive to do so. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to determining how many samples (i.e. workers) are required to achieve a certain level of statistical significance by showing how to automatically perform power analysis on questions of interest. Using a range of queries we demonstrate that power analysis can save significant amounts of money and time by often concluding that only a handful of results are required to arrive at a decision. We have implemented our approach within INTERPOLL ,a programmable developer-driven polling system that uses a generic crowd (Mechanical Turk) as a back-end. INTERPOLL automatically performs power analysis by analyzing both the structure of the query and the data that it dynamically polls from the crowd. In all of our studies we obtain statistically significant results for under $30, with most costing less than $10. Our approach saves both time and money for the survey maker."
1162851,14040,9475,Model-based feedback control of distributed air-conditioning loads for fast demand-side ancillary services,2013,"Load control (LC) of distributed populations of air conditioners (ACs) can provide effective demand-side ancillary services while reducing emissions and network operating costs. Pilot trials with ACs typically deploy model-free, open-loop strategies, which cannot deliver the full potential of LC as a network resource. Seeking more advanced strategies, much research in recent years has targeted the development of accurate models and LC approaches for this type of loads. Most existing approaches, however, are restricted to scenarios involving large numbers of ACs, which may not work in small populations, or require two-way communications with the controlled devices, which may come at high costs in widely distributed populations. This paper exploits a previously developed dynamic model for the aggregate demand of populations of ACs to design a simple controller readily implementable in such LC scenarios. The proposed feedback scheme broadcasts thermostat set-point offset changes to the ACs, and requires no direct communications from the devices to the central controller, using instead readings of total aggregate demand from a common power distribution connection point, which may include demand of uncontrolled loads. The scheme is validated on a numerical case study constructed by simulating a distributed population of ACs using real power and temperature data from a 70-house residential precinct, and is shown to deliver robust fast load following performance. The simulation results highlight the practical potential of the proposed model and feedback control scheme for analysing and shaping demand response of ACs using standard control techniques."
973627,14040,20796,Collaborative Filtering Incorporating Review Text and Co-clusters of Hidden User Communities and Item Groups,2014,"Most collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms only make use of the rating scores given by users for items. However, it is often the case that each rating score is associated with a piece of review text. Such review texts, which are capable of providing us valuable information to reveal the reasons why users give a certain rating, have not been exploited and they are usually ignored by most CF algorithms. Moreover, the underlying relationship buried in users and items has not been fully exploited. Items we would recommend can often be characterized into hidden groups (e.g. comedy, horror movie and action movie), and users can also be organized as hidden communities. We propose a new generative model to predict user's ratings on previously unrated items by considering review texts as well as hidden user communities and item groups relationship. Regarding the rating scores, traditional algorithms would not perform well on uncovering the community and group information of each user and each item since the user-item rating matrix is dyadic involving the mutual interactions between users and items. Instead, co-clustering, which is capable of conducting simultaneous clustering of two variables, is able to take advantage of such user-item relationships to better predict the rating scores. Additionally, co-clustering would be more effective for modeling the generation of review texts since different user communities would discuss different topics and vary their own wordings or expression patterns when dealing with different item groups. Besides, by modeling as a mixed membership over community and group respectively, each user or item can belong to multiple communities or groups with varying degrees. We have conducted extensive experiments to predict the missing rating scores on 22 real word datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model comparing with the state-of-the-art methods."
91321,14040,20358,Towards a scalable social recommender engine for online marketplaces: the case of apache solr,2014,"Recent research has unveiled the importance of online social networks for improving the quality of recommenders in several domains, what has encouraged the research community to investigate ways to better exploit the social information for recommendations. However, there is a lack of work that offers details of frameworks that allow an easy integration of social data with traditional recommendation algorithms in order to yield a straight-forward and scalable implementation of new and existing systems. Furthermore, it is rare to find details of performance evaluations of recommender systems such as hardware and software specifications or benchmarking results of server loading tests. In this paper we intend to bridge this gap by presenting the details of a social recommender engine for online marketplaces built upon the well-known search engine Apache Solr. We describe our architecture and also share implementation details to facilitate the re-use of our approach by people implementing recommender systems. In addition, we evaluate our framework from two perspectives: (a) recommendation algorithms and data sources, and (b) system performance under server stress tests. Using a dataset from the SecondLife virtual world that has both trading and social interactions, we contribute to research in social recommenders by showing how certain social features allow to improve recommendations in online marketplaces. On the platform implementation side, our evaluation results can serve as a baseline to people searching for performance references in terms of scalability, model training and testing trade-offs, real-time server performance and the impact of model updates in a production system."
1695945,14040,20854,Contextual constraints: consequences for interaction design,2014,"Constraints are part of any interaction design activity, as they inform as well as challenge and limit the designer. In this one-day workshop, we will discuss how constraints, which are resulting from their context, are fostering or hindering designs and the act of designing. Also constraints that have both positive and negative consequences will be addressed. The focus will be on limitations of how designers engage themselves with the context (e.g., in contextual design) as well as limitations on the design space as such (e.g., light conditions). Characteristics of constrained contexts might be their strict safety or security regulations, costly access, harsh conditions, temporal restrictions, rare existence, communication problems, etc. Examples for such heavily constrained contexts are environments like factories, cars and space ships, domains like finance and administration or seasonal events like New Year's Eve and Christmas, but this list is almost interminable.   With this workshop, we aim to address the assessment of types and forms of contextual constraints affecting design options  and/or  the respective design process. The vision is to better understand how to make use of the beneficial constraints for interaction design, and how to cope with hindering ones. We aim to collect experiences with contextual constraints, and seek to uncover design contexts that have so far rarely been in the focus of interaction design due to their hard approachability. We invite scholars and practitioners to provide a design experience (be it a use case, a design example, a requirements/context study or else) that was influenced by contextual constraints. Finally, the goal of the workshop is to better understand these particular contextually constrained design activities, but also to provide learnings for interaction design in general on how constraints influence the design of interactive systems."
932054,14040,9896,"Contested Collective Intelligence: Rationale, Technologies, and a Human-Machine Annotation Study",2012,"We propose the concept of Contested Collective Intelligence (CCI) as a distinctive subset of the broader Collective Intelligence design space. CCI is relevant to the many organizational contexts in which it is important to work with contested knowledge, for instance, due to different intellectual traditions, competing organizational objectives, information overload or ambiguous environmental signals. The CCI challenge is to design sociotechnical infrastructures to augment such organizational capability. Since documents are often the starting points for contested discourse, and discourse markers provide a powerful cue to the presence of claims, contrasting ideas and argumentation, discourse and rhetoric provide an annotation focus in our approach to CCI. Research in sensemaking, computer-supported discourse and rhetorical text analysis motivate a conceptual framework for the combined human and machine annotation of texts with this specific focus. This conception is explored through two tools: a social-semantic web application for human annotation and knowledge mapping (Cohere), plus the discourse analysis component in a textual analysis software tool (Xerox Incremental Parser: XIP). As a step towards an integrated platform, we report a case study in which a document corpus underwent independent human and machine analysis, providing quantitative and qualitative insight into their respective contributions. A promising finding is that significant contributions were signalled by authors via explicit rhetorical moves, which both human analysts and XIP could readily identify. Since working with contested knowledge is at the heart of CCI, the evidence that automatic detection of contrasting ideas in texts is possible through rhetorical discourse analysis is progress towards the effective use of automatic discourse analysis in the CCI framework."

This process implies the need of using technologies to support connectedness leading to negotiated outcomes, in addition to centralized and decentralized data and models. As Joseph Nye states in his 2010 book on The Power to Lead, leaders as those who help the group create and achieved shared goals,(p. XI) leadership is an integral part of effective group decision and negotiation (GDN) processes. Recognition of this bridge between the GDN and leadership areas allows us to bring to functioning leadership the technology available to support GDN processes. Also, the concept of connectedness has now become pervasive in social generations that are transforming the way organizations work and serve their customers and stakeholders.The newly redesigned HICSS-48 minitrack will continue to support research related to the role of NSS in a Web-centric platform and with applications in electronic markets, e-auctions and automated negotiation agents, and in social computing platforms. More particularly, we would like to expand this minitrack to explore research issues related to the concept, design, implementation, use and evaluation of technologies that involve decision-making, negotiation, leadership and social engagement in business. Since 1991, this minitrack has gathered a respectable collection of papers in this young but promising area of research. Collectively, the selected papers in this minitrack continue to offer innovative and thought-provoking research in computer-supported mediation, now embedded in a social context."
2499355,14040,11166,High Performance Offline and Online Distributed Collaborative Filtering,2012,"Big data analytics is a hot research area both in academia and industry. It envisages processing massive amounts of data at high rates to generate new insights leading to positive impact (for both users and providers) of industries such as E-commerce, Telecom, Finance, Life Sciences and so forth. We consider collaborative filtering (CF) and Clustering algorithms that are key fundamental analytics kernels that help in achieving these aims. High throughput CF and co-clustering on highly sparse and massive datasets, along with a high prediction accuracy, is a computationally challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical design for soft real-time (less than 1-minute.) distributed co-clustering based collaborative filtering algorithm. We study both the online and offline variants of this algorithm. Theoretical analysis of the time complexity of our algorithm proves the efficacy of our approach. Further, we present the impact of load balancing based optimizations on multi-core cluster architectures. Using the Netflix dataset(900M training ratings with replication) as well as the Yahoo KDD Cup(2.3B training ratings with replication) datasets, we demonstrate the performance and scalability of our algorithm on a large multi-core cluster architecture. In offline mode, our distributed algorithm demonstrates around 4x better performance (on Blue Gene/P) as compared to the best prior work, along with high accuracy. In online mode, we demonstrated around 3x better performance compared to baseline MPI implementation. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm provides the best known online and offline performance and scalability results with high accuracy on multi-core cluster architectures."
1717591,14040,10237,Which app will you use next?: collaborative filtering with interactional context,2013,"The application a smart phone user will launch next intuitively depends on the sequence of apps used  recently . More generally, when users interact with systems such as shopping websites or online radio, they click on items that are of interest in the  current  context. We call the sequence of clicks made in the current session  interactional context . It is desirable for a recommender system to use the context set by the user to update recommendations. Most current context-aware recommender systems focus on a relatively less dynamic  representational  context defined by attributes such as season, location and tastes. In this paper, we study the problem of collaborative filtering with interactional context, where the goal is to make personalized and dynamic recommendations to a user engaged in a session. To this end, we propose the  methodname  algorithm that works in two stages. First, users are clustered by their transition behavior (one-step Markov transition probabilities between items), and cluster-level Markov models are computed. Then personalized PageRank is computed for a given user on the corresponding cluster Markov graph, with a personalization vector derived from the current context. We give an interpretation of the second stage of the algorithm as adding an appropriate  context bias , in addition to  click bias  (or rating bias), to a classical neighborhood-based collaborative filtering model, where the neighborhood is determined from a Markov graph. Experimental results on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm, where we achieve at least 20% (up to 37%) improvement over competitive methods in the recall level at top-20."
929017,14040,23757,Tag Based Recommender System for Social Bookmarking Sites,2012,"It is often essential for people to consult with others and ask them about their past experience and thoughts when making choices. Exchanging ideas among people has become more meaningful since the extensive growth of information on the World Wide Web (WWW). People have access to tremendous amount of information, but choosing the most relevant information is of high effort. It was when recommender systems came into existence in 1992 in order to assist users in the process of finding the most appropriate information on WWW, and identify sets of items which are likely to be interesting for the users. Recommender systems have used different sources of data in order to identify users' interests. In addition, by growth of social resource sharing like social book marking sites, tagging activities can be considered as explicit knowledge for user and item modeling. Existing recommender systems lack use of external source of information for recommending the most appropriate item. They mainly use the information of their own website, while there is valuable information on the web which could improve the performance of the predictions. In this paper, we use Open Directory Project (ODP) data as external knowledge about web pages in addition to tagging activities of users in a social book marking site. We have designed a content based recommender system which can recommend the most relevant web pages for each user based on the user's profile and gathered information about web pages from ODP as implicit data. We empirically evaluate effect of ODP data on the predictions using Delicious dataset in order to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our recommender system outperforms when it uses ODP information as external source of data."

On the contrary, developing countries lacking basic necessities of life possess monopolistic electoral system in which candidates are elected based on tribes, family backgrounds, or landlord influences. They extort voters to cast votes against their promises for the provision of basic needs. Similarly voters also poll votes for personal interests being unaware of party manifesto or national interest. These issues can be addressed by social media, resulting as ongoing process of improvement for presently adopted electoral procedures. People of Pakistan utilized social media to garner support and campaign for political parties in General Elections 2013. Political leaders, parties, and people of Pakistan disseminated party's agenda and advocacy of party's ideology on Twitter without much campaigning cost. To study effectiveness of social media inferred from individual's political behavior, large scale analysis, sentiment detection & tweet classification was done in order to classify, predict and forecast election results. The experimental results depicts that social media content can be used as an effective indicator for capturing political behaviors of different parties Positive, negative and neutral behavior of the party followers as well as party's campaign impact can be predicted from the analysis. The analytical findings proved to be having considerable correspondence with actual results as published by Election Commission of Pakistan‥"
142336,14040,20358,Adaptive crowdsourcing for temporal crowds,2013,"Crowdsourcing is rapidly emerging as a computing paradigm that can employ the collective intelligence of a distributed human population to solve a wide variety of tasks. However, unlike organizational environments where workers have set work hours, known skill sets and performance indicators that can be monitored and controlled, most crowdsourcing platforms leverage the capabilities of fleeting workers who exhibit changing work patterns, expertise, and quality of work. Consequently, platforms exhibit significant variability in terms of performance characteristics (like response time, accuracy, and completion rate). While this variability has been folklore in the crowdsourcing community, we are the first to show data that displays this kind of changing behavior. Notably, these changes are not due to a distribution with high variance; rather, the distribution itself is changing over time.   Deciding which platform is most suitable given the requirements of a task is of critical importance in order to optimize performance; further, making the decision(s) adaptively to accommodate the dynamically changing crowd characteristics is a problem that has largely been ignored. In this paper, we address the changing crowds problem and, specifically, propose a multi-armed bandit based framework. We introduce the simple epsilon-smart algorithm that performs robustly. Counterfactual results based on real-life data from two popular crowd platforms demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Further simulations using a random-walk model for crowd performance demonstrate its scalability and adaptability to more general scenarios."
2592299,14040,21989,Using Depth Information for Real-Time Face Detection,2014,"This paper proposes a method for real-time face detection. The proposed method is to use depth information to detect faces in a manner that performs robustly even in response to changes of lighting and face sizes. And we use the depth difference features in depth image and apply this to the boosting algorithm for training and recognition. The depth difference features that this study proposes to use enable dynamic changes to be made to the window according to the face size. The conventional method of face detection was to define the size of the face to be detected in advance, and complete scanning for all the possible sizes. By contrast, this new method requires only a single scan to detect faces of all sizes, since it uses the central depth value to predict size based on 2 nd polynomial model. These detected depth difference features are performed training and recognition step with boosting algorithm(1). The boosting classifier performs recognition by connecting strong classifiers that are constituted by weak classifiers. Research on image-based face detection can be broadly categorized into the knowledge-based method, feature-based method, template-matching, and appearance- based method. In this study, real-time face detection is performed by improving the boosting classifier, which is one of the appearance-based methods, and applying this to depth images. The depth difference features used in this study consist of improved MCT features. The use of these MCT features was proposed by Froba(3). Because of the MCT features used by Froba express local features, they perform very strongly in response to changes in lighting, and the modified AdaBoost classifier with the cascade structure reduces the false positive rate and thereby improves face detection performance. However, when compared to the method for face detection proposed by Viola and Jones(2), which uses Haar-like features combined with the AdaBoost classifier, the MCT feature is at a relatively disadvantage. The MCT feature uses a fixed mask and performs detection using the shape while down-scaling the image, and this results in a relatively slower detection speed in comparison to the Haar-like feature, which extracts the feature by changing the mask size to ensure that strong detection performance in response to changes in the face size occurring in the input image. This paper uses depth images and depth difference feature to perform face"
293216,14040,20358,Subgraph frequencies: mapping the empirical and extremal geography of large graph collections,2013,"A growing set of on-line applications are generating data that can be viewed as very large collections of small, dense social graphs --- these range from sets of social groups, events, or collaboration projects to the vast collection of graph neighborhoods in large social networks. A natural question is how to usefully define a domain-independent 'coordinate system' for such a collection of graphs, so that the set of possible structures can be compactly represented and understood within a common space. In this work, we draw on the theory of graph homomorphisms to formulate and analyze such a representation, based on computing the frequencies of small induced subgraphs within each graph. We find that the space of subgraph frequencies is governed both by its combinatorial properties --- based on extremal results that constrain all graphs --- as well as by its empirical properties --- manifested in the way that real social graphs appear to lie near a simple one-dimensional curve through this space.   We develop flexible frameworks for studying each of these aspects. For capturing empirical properties, we characterize a simple stochastic generative model, a single-parameter extension of Erdos-Renyi random graphs, whose stationary distribution over subgraphs closely tracks the one-dimensional concentration of the real social graph families. For the extremal properties, we develop a tractable linear program for bounding the feasible space of subgraph frequencies by harnessing a toolkit of known extremal graph theory. Together, these two complementary frameworks shed light on a fundamental question pertaining to social graphs: what properties of social graphs are 'social' properties and what properties are 'graph' properties?   We conclude with a brief demonstration of how the coordinate system we examine can also be used to perform classification tasks, distinguishing between structures arising from different types of social graphs."

As our previous studies have shown, a simple transfer to other application domains (e.g. workplace design) may be possible but result into inaccuracies. With the following study we analyzed the applicability of two typical DHMs for the design of personal equipment and for identifying potential conflicts between different pieces of equipment. Such an application differs strongly from automotive applications, but many similar uses of DHMs can be observed in daily life. The analysis addresses different aspects: At first, the general functionality of the DHMs was screened. Required functions were either available instantly, available by workarounds, or unavailable. A subsequent verification and validation study analyzed potential shortcoming for the available functions. It consists of an empirical survey with different typical soldiers' movements. The data include maximum reach, focusing a target with a binocular or aiming with different postures. A number of motion sequences were selected for the analysis. Results show that simple movements were modeled quite accurately. But complex movements were hardly possible to model and large inaccuracies were observed. An important functional shortcoming resulted from limited possibilities to integrate virtual objects of personal equipment into the DHM. This prevented an analysis of conflicts between personal equipment."
1755876,14040,9896,Big Board: Teleconferencing Over Maps for Shared Situational Awareness,2014,"Collaborative technologies for information sharing are an invaluable resource for emergency managers to respond to and manage highly dynamic events such as natural disasters and other emergencies. However, many standard collaboration tools can be limited either because they provide passive presentation and dissemination of information, or because they are targeted towards highly specific usage scenarios that require considerable training to use the tools. We present a real-time gather and share system called Big Board which facilitates collaboration over maps. The Big Board is an open-source, web based, real time visual collaborative environment that runs on all modern web browsers and uses open-source web standards developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and WorldWideWeb Consortium (W3C). An evaluation of Big Board was conducted by school representatives in North Carolina for use in situational understanding for school closure decisions during winter weather events. The decision to close schools has major societal impacts and is one that is usually made based on how well a teenage driver could handle wintry precipitation on a road. Collecting information on the conditions of roads is especially critical, however gathering and sharing of this information within a county can be difficult. Participants in the study found the Big Board intuitive and useful for sharing real time information, such as road conditions and temperatures, leading up to and during a winter storm scenario. We have adapted the Big Board to manage risks and hazards during other types of emergencies such as tropical storm conditions."
2585415,14040,21989,Designing Mobile Phone Interfaces for Age Diversity in South Africa: One-World versus Diverse Islands,2013,"Designing for diversity is a laudable aim. How to achieve this, in the context of mobile phone usage by South African seniors, is a moot point. We considered this question from two possible perspectives: universal (one-world) versus focused design (designing for diverse islands of users). Each island would be characterised by a measure of relative homogeneity in terms of user interface needs. Our particular focus in this paper is age diversity. The universal approach attempts to deliver a design that can be all things to all people - meeting the needs of all users within one user interface. The islander approach delivers specific and different designs for islands within a diverse world. To determine which the best approach would be, in the South African context, we dispatched a team of student researchers to interview participants from an older generation, on a one-to-one basis. It was beneficial to deploy aspiring designers to carry out this research because we wanted to confront aspiring researchers with the differences between their own and other generations' usage of, and attitudes towards, mobile phones. Our study found that there were indeed significant age-related differences in mobile phone usage. Our research delivered insights that led to a model of the factors impacting mobile phone usage of the senior generation as a series of filters between the user and their device. We conclude that the island approach is more suitable for age-specific design. This approach might well become less fitting as a more technologically experienced population ages, but at present there is a clear need for an age-sensitive mobile interface design."
143314,14040,21989,3D Hand Anthropometry of Korean Teenager’s and Comparison with Manual Method,2014,"The requirements of wearing products fitting comfort was conti- nuously increasing and considerable attentions had been paid for a long time. The assessment of the physical dimensions of the human hand provided a me- tric description to establish human-machine compatibility. Higher accuracy in hand anthropometric measurements could be achieved with the aids of an image analysis system. Scanning of hand surfaces either 2D or 3D was an alternative method for manual measurements. Three-dimensional anthropometry may lead to significant improvement in fitting comfort of wearing products. The pur- pose of this study was to measure 3D hand anthropometry and compared it with manual methods. For that purpose, 10 hand measurements of the right hand (lengths, breadths, and circumference of hand and fingers) were taken from 1,700 middle and high school students by age ranged from 13 to 19 years old. The hand was measured by manual (using anthropometric sliding, spreading ca- lipers and measuring tape) and using a high-resolution 3D hand scanner (NEXHAND H-100, Knitech, South Korea) with the scanning accuracy ± 0.5 mm. From the scanned data, the hand measurements were extracted using scan- ning software (Enhand, Knitech, South Korea). Mean and standard deviation for each hand measurements were calculated. T-test statistical test on the data re- vealed that there was no significant difference between the manual and 3D hand measurements (p > 0.05). Therefore, 3D anthropometry can be replaced with manual methods. The data gathered may be used for ergo-design applications of hand tools and devices. And also it can provide a great help to develop a hand anthropometry database for hand wearing products."
2213070,14040,9713,Location-based and preference-aware recommendation using sparse geo-social networking data,2012,"The popularity of location-based social networks provide us with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their location histories. In this paper, we present a location-based and preference-aware recommender system that offers a particular user a set of venues (such as restaurants) within a geospatial range with the consideration of both: 1) User preferences, which are automatically learned from her location history and 2) Social opinions, which are mined from the location histories of the  local experts.  This recommender system can facilitate people's travel not only near their living areas but also to a city that is new to them. As a user can only visit a limited number of locations, the user-locations matrix is very sparse, leading to a big challenge to traditional collaborative filtering-based location recommender systems. The problem becomes even more challenging when people travel to a new city. To this end, we propose a novel location recommender system, which consists of two main parts:  offline modeling  and  online recommendation.  The  offline modeling  part models each individual's personal preferences with a weighted category hierarchy (WCH) and infers the expertise of each user in a city with respect to different category of locations according to their location histories using an iterative learning model. The  online recommendation  part selects candidate  local experts  in a geospatial range that matches the user's preferences using a preference-aware candidate selection algorithm and then infers a score of the candidate locations based on the opinions of the selected  local experts.  Finally, the top- k  ranked locations are returned as the recommendations for the user. We evaluated our system with a large-scale real dataset collected from Foursquare. The results confirm that our method offers more effective recommendations than baselines, while having a good efficiency of providing location recommendations."
1463851,14040,20561,Identifying Weaknesses in VM/Hypervisor Interfaces,2013,"As cloud and virtualized environments become more widely used to solve challenges faced by companies of all sizes, it is increasingly likely that this infrastructure will be a common focus of attacks in the years to come. Successful attacks against this infrastructure could allow an attacker to break out of the virtual environment and gain control of the physical infrastructure effectively compromising the entire system. Given the recent surge in the development and deployment of these environments, it is reasonable to expect that these systems have not undergone the same amount of testing that comes with age and wide acceptance, and which we often require for critical services. Therefore, in-depth analysis of the attack surfaces exposed by these environments is necessary to ensure the security of these systems. This paper describes a Cyber Fast Track (CFT) project to create a testing framework to analyze the interfaces exposed by several hyper visors to potentially untrusted users (inside VMs) for vulnerabilities. The methods used consist of random input testing of emulated devices by intercepting and modifying valid device I/O with a state-aware system. These techniques are general enough that they may be extended to test many interfaces across a wide range of virtualization systems. This project then uses this tool against current versions of several virtualization systems with the ultimate goal to inform developers and system administrators alike about potential vulnerabilities in these systems."
1512116,14040,20561,A Neuro-fuzzy Approach to Bad Debt Recovery in Healthcare,2014,"In the U.S. the healthcare industry is often plagued by unpaid bills, collection agency fees, and outstanding medical testing costs. All these factors contribute significantly to the rising cost of healthcare. Health care providers often have to treat patients on credit, especially in emergency and trauma cases. Unlike financial institutions health care providers do not collect financial information about their patients. This lack of information makes it difficult to evaluate whether a particular patient-debtor is likely to pay his/her bill. In recent years researchers have started to recognize the potential of data mining methods in improving our understanding of medical bad-debt, but there is relatively little research that examines the effectiveness of data mining methods in classifying bad debt in healthcare. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in classifying bad debt in the healthcare context. The data analysis and evaluation of the performance of the ANFIS model are based on a fairly large unbalanced data sample provided by a healthcare company, in which cases with recovered bad debts are grossly under represented. Computer simulation shows that ANFIS is a viable method which produced under some scenarios good classification accuracy. More in-depth interpretation of the results, including nonlinear interaction between various factors, is provided through the analysis of the control surfaces generated by ANFIS and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) charts. Finally the paper also shows the potential of data mining models to classify unknown cases, which are a potential source of revenue recovery."
2846648,14040,20332,Fused matrix factorization with geographical and social influence in location-based social networks,2012,"Recently, location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Gowalla, Foursquare, Facebook, and Brightkite, etc., have attracted millions of users to share their social friendship and their locations via check-ins. The available check-in information makes it possible to mine users' preference on locations and to provide favorite recommendations. Personalized Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a significant task in LBSNs since it can help targeted users explore their surroundings as well as help third-party developers to provide personalized services. To solve this task, matrix factorization is a promising tool due to its success in recommender systems. However, previously proposed matrix factorization (MF) methods do not explore geographical influence, e.g., multi-center check-in property, which yields suboptimal solutions for the recommendation. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to fuse MF with geographical and social influence for POI recommendation in LBSNs. We first capture the geographical influence via modeling the probability of a user's check-in on a location as a Multicenter Gaussian Model (MGM). Next, we include social information and fuse the geographical influence into a generalized matrix factorization framework. Our solution to POI recommendation is efficient and scales linearly with the number of observations. Finally, we conduct thorough experiments on a large-scale real-world LBSNs dataset and demonstrate that the fused matrix factorization framework with MGM utilizes the distance information sufficiently and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods significantly."
1049023,14040,23836,Privacy Preserving Techniques for Location Based Services in Mobile Networks,2012,"The proliferation of smart phones and handheld mobile devices spurs a variety of personalized information services that utilize users' current location, known as Location-Based Services (LBS). Privacy protection is of great importance for such service users in mobile and wireless networks. However, as mobile devices are highly autonomous and heterogeneous, it is challenging to design generic protection techniques and achieve high level of privacy protection. Our study focuses on both potential privacy threats and privacy preserving mechanisms in mobile ad hoc networks. Preliminary work shows that the proposed system architecture and protection mechanisms exhibit satisfactory performance. The remaining work for completing the PhD dissertation is then presented. The proposed research carries significant intellectual merits and potential broader impacts in the following aspects. (1) We investigate the impact of inferential attacks on LBS users in mobile and wireless networks, and prove the vulnerability of using long-term pseudonyms for camouflaging users' real identities. (2) We propose a novel privacy metric to quantify system's resilience to such attack models. (3) An effective and extensible privacy architecture based on the mix zone model is designed. (4) We conduct rigorous analytical study, and design a privacy protection mechanism under real world constraints, e.g., traffic density and heterogeneity on different roads. (5) This proposal addresses the privacy preservation problem from a novel angle and lays a solid foundation for future research in protecting users' location privacy."
1344944,14040,9896,The penguin and the leviathan: towards cooperative human systems design,2012,"A decade ago, Wikipedia burst into a world not ready to comprehend it. Thousands of people cooperating effectively, without price signals to offer 'incentives' or managerial hierarchy to direct efforts, was an impossibility. And yet, it moves. And as it moved it combined with a deep shift across many disciplines, from biology and neuroscience to organizational sociology, experimental economics, and social psychology to paint a very different view of who we are as human beings. Slowly pushing back against decades of ever-refined analyses based on self-interested rationality, we begin to see that we are diverse beings; that a majority of us responds cooperatively to cooperative settings--we tend to treat well those who have treated us well, rather than take advantage of them; we tend to do what we think is right and fair, when it is clear in the setting what that is; we experience empathy, and it makes us more generous and trustworthy; we experience solidarity with others, and that makes us contributed more willingly to the group's goals. Moreover, explicit payments, the touchstone of mechanism design under universal self-interested rationality, turns out to have a much more complex relationship with motivation than simple addition. All this work in basic behavioral sciences combines with observations from organizational sociology, political science, and management studies combines with social software to provide an increasingly better articulated basis on which to develop a field of cooperative human systems design."
1718892,14040,20796,Interactive collaborative filtering,2013,"In this paper, we study collaborative filtering (CF) in an interactive setting, in which a recommender system continuously recommends items to individual users and receives interactive feedback. Whilst users enjoy sequential recommendations, the recommendation predictions are constantly refined using up-to-date feedback on the recommended items. Bringing the interactive mechanism back to the CF process is fundamental because the ultimate goal for a recommender system is about the discovery of interesting items for individual users and yet users' personal preferences and contexts evolve over time during the interactions with the system. This requires us not to distinguish between the stages of collecting information to construct the user profile and making recommendations, but to seamlessly integrate these stages together during the interactive process, with the goal of maximizing the overall recommendation accuracy throughout the interactions. This mechanism naturally addresses the cold-start problem as any user can immediately receive sequential recommendations without providing ratings beforehand. We formulate the interactive CF with the probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) framework, and leverage several exploitation-exploration algorithms to select items, including the empirical Thompson sampling and upper confidence bound based algorithms. We conduct our experiment on cold-start users as well as warm-start users with drifting taste. Results show that the proposed methods have significant improvements over several strong baselines for the MovieLens, EachMovie and Netflix datasets."
2269249,14040,8927,Co-factorization machines: modeling user interests and predicting individual decisions in Twitter,2013,"Users of popular services like Twitter and Facebook are often simultaneously overwhelmed with the amount of information delivered via their social connections and miss out on much content that they might have liked to see, even though it was distributed outside of their social circle. Both issues serve as difficulties to the users and drawbacks to the services.   Social media service providers can benefit from understanding user interests and how they interact with the service, potentially predicting their behaviors in the future. In this paper, we address the problem of simultaneously predicting user decisions and modeling users' interests in social media by analyzing rich information gathered from Twitter. The task differs from conventional recommender systems as the cold-start problem is ubiquitous, and rich features, including textual content, need to be considered. We build predictive models for user decisions in Twitter by proposing Co-Factorization Machines (CoFM), an extension of a state-of-the-art recommendation model, to handle multiple aspects of the dataset at the same time. Additionally, we discuss and compare ranking-based loss functions in the context of recommender systems, providing the first view of how they vary from each other and perform in real tasks. We explore an extensive set of features and conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, concluding that CoFM with ranking-based loss functions is superior to state-of-the-art methods and yields interpretable latent factors."
1062795,14040,422,Making recommendations from multiple domains,2013,"Given the vast amount of information on the World Wide Web, recommender systems are increasingly being used to help filter irrelevant data and suggest information that would interest users. Traditional systems make recommendations based on a single domain e.g., movie or book domain. Recent work has examined the correlations in different domains and designed models that exploit user preferences on a source domain to predict user preferences on a target domain. However, these methods are based on matrix factorization and can only be applied to two-dimensional data. Transferring high dimensional data from one domain to another requires decomposing the high dimensional data to binary relations which results in information loss.   Furthermore, this decomposition creates a large number of matrices that need to be transferred and combining them in the target domain is non-trivial. Separately, researchers have looked into using social network information to improve recommendation. However, this social network information has not been explored in cross domain collaborative filtering. In this work, we propose a generalized cross domain collaborative filtering framework that integrates social network information seamlessly with cross domain data. This is achieved by utilizing tensor factorization with topic based social regularization. This framework is able to transfer high dimensional data without the need for decomposition by finding shared implicit cluster-level tensor from multiple domains. Extensive experiments conducted on real world datasets indicate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-art algorithms for item recommendation, user recommendation and tag recommendation."
814156,14040,20561,Investigating User Acceptance of a Screenshot-Based Interaction System in the Context of Advanced Computer Software Learning,2014,"Most e-learning systems provide course materials in a variety of formats, such as text, image, and video, and allow students to interact with their classmates and teachers by means of discussion forums, chat rooms, or e-mail. However, most interactions between students seeking technical support are in textual format. To promote effective discussion and interaction between users, e-learning systems should make better use of media. Drawing on the media-richness theory, screenshot-based interaction can be regarded as the best medium for describing problems and troubleshooting in the context of computer software. As this form of interaction between users is based on screenshots, it is termed screenshot-based interaction. This study entailed the development of a screenshot-based interaction system, which is a system of discussion forums for advanced computer software learners, by integrating the richness of social-networking media with the traditional structure of present-day discussion forums. The system provided students with a convenient and clear means of explaining advanced computer software problems, by uploading screenshots, dragging rectangles, and leaving comments in text boxes. It also allowed students to give and receive individual responses to these problems, thereby enhancing their learning. In addition, the study investigated user acceptance of the screenshot-based interaction system. The results, based on data collected from 418 students, indicated that students' perceived enjoyment had a strong, positive, and direct effect on their behavioral intention, and that colleague opinion had a direct effect on their perceived enjoyment and their perception of the system's ease of use and usefulness, which in turn affected behavioral intention indirectly."
977429,14040,422,GetJar mobile application recommendations with very sparse datasets,2012,"The Netflix competition of 2006 [2] has spurred significant activity in the recommendations field, particularly in approaches using latent factor models [3,5,8,12] However, the near ubiquity of the Netflix and the similar MovieLens datasets 1  may be narrowing the generality of lessons learned in this field. At GetJar, our goal is to make appealing recommendations of mobile applications (apps). For app usage, we observe a distribution that has higher kurtosis (heavier head and longer tail) than that for the aforementioned movie datasets. This happens primarily because of the large disparity in resources available to app developers and the low cost of app publication relative to movies.   In this paper we compare a latent factor (PureSVD) and a memory-based model with our novel PCA-based model, which we call Eigenapp. We use both accuracy and variety as evaluation metrics. PureSVD did not perform well due to its reliance on explicit feedback such as ratings, which we do not have. Memory-based approaches that perform vector operations in the original high dimensional space over-predict popular apps because they fail to capture the neighborhood of less popular apps. They have high accuracy due to the concentration of mass in the head, but did poorly in terms of variety of apps exposed. Eigenapp, which exploits neighborhood information in low dimensional spaces, did well both on precision and variety, underscoring the importance of dimensionality reduction to form quality neighborhoods in high kurtosis distributions."
2489186,14040,11317,Imaginary phone: learning imaginary interfaces by transferring spatial memory from a familiar device,2011,"We propose a method for learning how to use an imaginary interface (i.e., a spatial non-visual interface) that we call transfer learning. By using a physical device (e.g. an iPhone) a user inadvertently learns the interface and can then transfer that knowledge to an imaginary interface. We illustrate this concept with our Imaginary Phone prototype. With it users interact by mimicking the use of a physical iPhone by tapping and sliding on their empty non-dominant hand without visual feedback. Pointing on the hand is tracked using a depth camera and touch events are sent wirelessly to an actual iPhone, where they invoke the corresponding actions. Our prototype allows the user to perform everyday task such as picking up a phone call or launching the timer app and setting an alarm. Imaginary Phone thereby serves as a shortcut that frees users from the necessity of retrieving the actual physical device. We present two user studies that validate the three assumptions underlying the transfer learning method. (1) Users build up spatial memory automatically while using a physical device: participants knew the correct location of 68% of their own iPhone home screen apps by heart. (2) Spatial memory transfers from a physical to an imaginary inter-face: participants recalled 61% of their home screen apps when recalling app location on the palm of their hand. (3) Palm interaction is precise enough to operate a typical mobile phone: Participants could reliably acquire 0.95cm wide iPhone targets on their palm-sufficiently large to operate any iPhone standard widget."
1581641,14040,20561,Using Ontologies and Soft Systems Methodology to Provide Multi-user Support in Problem Structuring,2012,"Decision support systems (DSS) are aimed at helping decision makers in devising appropriate solutions to business problems while negotiation support systems (NSS) are aimed at assisting stakeholders in reaching mutually satisfactory decisions. The successful use of these systems involves a combination of human ability and computer support. An implicit assumption underlying their use is that the business problems for which they are deployed have been carefully defined by the stakeholders prior to their use. This includes, in particular, understanding of the problem variables and their possible impact on the decision outcomes and knowing which information is necessary for supporting it. However, this assumption might not hold in the modern business environment. This is due to the increasing complexity and rate of change of the environment, the geographical and temporal dispersion of modern organizations, and the diversity and quantity of information sources that is available. In this paper we propose the idea of extending the scope of these systems to include a step preceding the solution process: problem framing. We claim that new technologies such as Web 2.0 provide novel opportunities to add this facility to DSS and NSS. To achieve this, we propose a novel approach combining domain and task ontologies. The task ontology we propose employs concepts from soft systems methodology. Specifically, we suggest that a stakeholder can use the ontologies to understand the problem, frame the issue, and identify the information required for the task. The ontologies can support accessing the information sources when the system is being used by stakeholders."
2355845,14040,10237,Xbox movies recommendations: variational bayes matrix factorization with embedded feature selection,2013,"We present a matrix factorization model inspired by challenges we encountered while working on the Xbox movies recommendation system. The item catalog in a recommender system is typically equipped with meta-data features in the form of labels. However, only part of these features are informative or useful with regard to collaborative filtering. By incorporating a novel sparsity prior on feature parameters, the model automatically discerns and utilizes informative features while simultaneously pruning non-informative features.   The model is designed for binary feedback, which is common in many real-world systems where numeric rating data is scarce or non-existent. However, the overall framework is applicable to any likelihood function. Model parameters are estimated with a Variational Bayes inference algorithm, which is robust to over-fitting and does not require cross-validation and fine tuning of regularization coefficients. The efficacy of our method is illustrated on a sample from the Xbox movies dataset as well as on the publicly available MovieLens dataset. In both cases, the proposed solution provides superior predictive accuracy, especially for long-tail items. We then demonstrate the feature selection capabilities and compare against the common case of simple Gaussian priors. Finally, we show that even without features, our model performs better than a baseline model trained with the popular stochastic gradient descent approach."
765548,14040,10237,OrdRec: an ordinal model for predicting personalized item rating distributions,2011,"We propose a collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation framework, which is based on viewing user feedback on products as ordinal, rather than the more common numerical view. This way, we do not need to interpret each user feedback value as a number, but only rely on the more relaxed assumption of having an order among the different feedback ratings. Such an ordinal view frequently provides a more natural reflection of the user intention when providing qualitative ratings, allowing users to have different internal scoring scales. Moreover, we can address scenarios where assigning numerical scores to different types of user feedback would not be easy. Our approach is based on a pointwise ordinal model, which allows it to linearly scale with data size. The framework can wrap most collaborative filtering algorithms, upgrading those algorithms designed to handle numerical values into being able to handle ordinal values. In particular, we demonstrate our framework with wrapping a leading matrix factorization CF method. A cornerstone of our method is its ability to predict a full probability distribution of the expected item ratings, rather than only a single score for an item. One of the advantages this brings is a novel approach to estimating the confidence level in each individual prediction. Compared to previous approaches to confidence estimation, ours is more principled and empirically superior in its accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on some of the largest publicly available datasets, the Netflix data, and the Yahoo! Music data."
1055653,14040,10237,Real-time top-n recommendation in social streams,2012,"The Social Web is successfully established, and steadily growing in terms of users, content and services. People generate and consume data in real-time within social networking services, such as Twitter, and increasingly rely upon continuous streams of messages for real-time access to fresh knowledge about current affairs. In this paper, we focus on analyzing social streams in real-time for personalized topic recommendation and discovery. We consider collaborative filtering as an online ranking problem and present Stream Ranking Matrix Factorization - RMFX -, which uses a pairwise approach to matrix factorization in order to optimize the personalized ranking of topics. Our novel approach follows a selective sampling strategy to perform online model updates based on active learning principles, that closely simulates the task of identifying relevant items from a pool of mostly uninteresting ones. RMFX is particularly suitable for large scale applications and experiments on the 476 million Twitter tweets dataset show that our online approach largely outperforms recommendations based on Twitter's global trend, and it is also able to deliver highly competitive Top-N recommendations faster while using less space than Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF), a state-of-the-art matrix factorization technique for Collaborative Filtering, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach."
135402,14040,21989,A Study on Query-by-Any-Word Based Music Retrieval System,2014,"Recently, commercial interest in the field of music information re- trieval (MIR) has been growing rapidly. This paper describes a MIR system that accept any Japanese word as query. Previous studies focused on emotion based MIR system generally uses limited words such as major adjectives or kan- sei words. However, emotion of the music is represented by various words in practice. Music review is a one of good example. Word can also express compli- cated emotions with which various emotions are mixed. Starting from this point of view, we propose a method for MIR system that is able to find the appropriate music directory from any word as query. There are three main issues in this study. First one is how to mapping music and emotion. We introduce two-dimensional space which can represent emotion and music in a unified space. This space is obtained automatically from the emotion evaluation data of words and music. Second issue is extraction method for musical feature in order to map to the emo- tion space from given music. In our approach, optimal feature parameters are automatically selected with respect to each axis of the emotion space. Third is- sue is how to cope with any query word. Our method can find a music pieace corresponding to emotion of any word by measurement of relationship between each basic word for the given query word. A feature point of this approach is the use of co-occurrence probability of words obtained from a large scale of web text corpus. We performed a subjective evaluation experiments using 100 classical musical pieces and 50 Japanese words that are often used in music reviews. The experimental results show that our proposed system can find the correct music piece which matches mostly given query word."

A variety of digital traces can now be used to infer how people move about their city and extract their context and habits. Personalization and recommender systems, potentially merged with the data that people store online (e.g., social networks, web ratings), can then not only be used to recommend new places and events that they may find interesting to attend, but, more broadly, personalize and enhance any service that people find themselves using.   The goal of this one-day workshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore, discuss, and understand challenges and new opportunities for personalisation within the urban domain. Topics of discussion during the workshop included: Innovative applications of recommender systems in mobile settings; Location and/or context-based recommender systems; Recommending locations, venues, and social events; Incentives and persuasion in mobile settings; User-centric evaluation of personalised mobile services; Recommender systems for smart cities/urban environments; Intelligent transport systems; Real-time and/or multi-source information processing for personalisation; Personalized and adaptive mobile interfaces; Security, privacy, reputation and trust issues in mobile recommenders; Geographic/location-based social networks and social filtering; Case studies of recommender systems in mobile envi- ronments."
747143,14040,10237,Speeding up the Xbox recommender system using a euclidean transformation for inner-product spaces,2014,"A prominent approach in collaborative filtering based recommender systems is using dimensionality reduction (matrix factorization) techniques to map users and items into low-dimensional vectors. In such systems, a higher inner product between a user vector and an item vector indicates that the item better suits the user's preference. Traditionally, retrieving the most suitable items is done by scoring and sorting all items. Real world online recommender systems must adhere to strict response-time constraints, so when the number of items is large, scoring all items is intractable.   We propose a novel order preserving transformation, mapping the maximum inner product search problem to Euclidean space nearest neighbor search problem. Utilizing this transformation, we study the efficiency of several (approximate) nearest neighbor data structures. Our final solution is based on a novel use of the PCA-Tree data structure in which results are augmented using paths one hamming distance away from the query (neighborhood boosting). The end result is a system which allows approximate matches (items with relatively high inner product, but not necessarily the highest one). We evaluate our techniques on two large-scale recommendation datasets, Xbox Movies and Yahoo~Music, and show that this technique allows trading off a slight degradation in the recommendation quality for a significant improvement in the retrieval time."

In this work we describe a detailed analysis of a sparse, large scale dataset, specifically designed to push the envelope of recommender system models. The Yahoo! Music dataset consists of more than a million users, 600 thousand musical items and more than 250 million ratings, collected over a decade. It is characterized by three unique features: First, rated items are multi-typed, including tracks, albums, artists and genres; Second, items are arranged within a four level taxonomy, proving itself effective in coping with a severe sparsity problem that originates from the unusually large number of items (compared to, e.g., movie ratings datasets). Finally, fine resolution timestamps associated with the ratings enable a comprehensive temporal and session analysis. We further present a matrix factorization model exploiting the special characteristics of this dataset. In particular, the model incorporates a rich bias model with terms that capture information from the taxonomy of items and different temporal dynamics of music ratings. To gain additional insights of its properties, we organized the KddCup-2011 competition about this dataset. As the competition drew thousands of participants, we expect the dataset to attract considerable research activity in the future."
1028856,14040,11470,TelePort: Virtual touring of Dun-Huang with a mobile device,2013,"Some of our daily encountering is the objects of pictures, antiques, sculptures or wall-paintings captured or moved from the source space to another media platform. For example, the Direct Mail advertising of house sale, the historical exhibit in the museum. In fact, few figures or text descriptions will never be able to provide us the rewarding experience unless people can actually visit the source space in person. Inspired by the Boo's doors in the Disney's cartoon of Monsters Inc. which are used as a pathway to different spaces, we propose the “TelePort” as a gateway providing a virtual touring to the source space and achieve the prototype using a mobile device. To begin the TelePort, users first aim the object onto the mobile's screen. Subsequently, the screen view will immediately transfer to the view of the source space seamlessly as if users look into the space from the entrance gate. After transferring to the space, users can explore the source space and interact with the contents belonged to the space in reality through panorama visualization. To support the first person navigation, the viewpoint direction within the space can be detected by the mobile pose. This novel navigation interface can deliver to users an interesting and realistic experience as teleportation. Our contribution is to demonstrate an innovative experience for a virtual tour of the Mogao Caves using a mobile device. The “Teleport” featuring the virtual gateway which brings users to the Cave not only attracts attention but also enhances the experience of space exploring."
1683838,14040,9896,Bridging Identity Gaps—Supporting Identity Performance in Citizen Service Encounters,2012,"This paper explores in situ citizen service encounters in government offices. Drawing upon ethnographically informed fieldwork in Canada and Denmark, we discuss the challenges to supporting citizens in constructing and performing identities in public service settings. Our data suggests that citizens make use of at least three strategies in their attempts to perform the appropriate identities needed to “fit within the system” in specific encounters with government. There exists a strong correlation between citizens’ ability to perform identities that are compatible with the bureaucratic administrative processes and the quality and swiftness of the service they receive. As we bring to light in this paper, this “fitting in” with rigid bureaucratic procedures and IT systems interestingly requires a substantial collaborative effort between the receiver(s) of the service and a complex constellation of surrounding stakeholders and intermediaries. This collaboration and the performing of multiple identities raises challenges for the design of e-government systems aimed at supporting physical and digital citizen service provision, as well as issues regarding privacy, citizenship, and public service quality. Lastly, we turn to a discussion of how the established identity gaps can be addressed through design. Information and communication technologies as well as face-to-face encounters have an important role to play in the building of an interface to government. Here, it is paramount to consider the context in which people and systems must function in order to meet the need for dynamic identity performance."
1690017,14040,20561,"Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Virtual Meeting Tool-Based Innovation for UML Technology Training in Global Organizations",2012,"End-user training is complicated to implement in global corporations whose activities are typically scattered across multiple sites in different countries and leverage information systems in various ways. This is especially true in global software development where the sites may leverage a development tool for totally different purposes. Web-based Virtual Meeting Tools (VMT) enable synchronous communication globally through interactive audio, online chats, video, and the sharing of presentations. They provide potentially a cost effective way to train even complex topics to large numbers of people in global settings. Few industrial experiences from the design and use of VMT-based training innovations have been reported. This paper draws upon a case study in a global corporation to describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a training innovation, consisting of a set of courses delivered by means of a VMT and conference calls, to support the global deployment of a Unified Modeling Language (UML) modeling tool and to develop UML modeling skills. Evaluation is based on interviews to verify 1) the impacts of the innovation on skills, knowledge and motivation, 2) perceived learner satisfaction with respect to the innovation. The innovation proved successful in improving skills, knowledge, and motivation in the case organization and learners were satisfied with it. Other organizations may benefit from using VMT to train people to use similar complex information systems for supporting global software development."
89575,14040,21989,Comparing Input Modalities for Peripheral Interaction: A Case Study on Peripheral Music Control,2013,"Abstract. In graphical user interfaces, every application usually asks for the us-er’s full attention during interaction with it. Even marginal side activities often force the user to switch windows, which results in attention shifts and increased cognitive load. Peripheral interaction addresses this problem by providing input facilities in the periphery of the user’s attention by relying on divided attention and human capabilities such as proprioception and spatial memory. Recent work shows promising results by shifting tasks to the periphery for parallel task execution. Up to now, most of these interfaces rely on tag-based objects, tokens or wearable devices, which need to be grasped and manipulated, e.g., by turn-ing, moving or pressing the device. To explore this design space further, we implemented three modalities for peripheral interaction with a desktop audio player application – graspable inte-raction, touch and freehand gestures. In an eight-week in-situ deployment, we compared the three modalities to each other and to media keys (as the state-of-the-art approach). We found that all modalities can be successfully used in the (visual and attentional) periphery and reduce the amount of cognitive load when interacting with an audio player. With this work we intend to (1) illustrate the variety of possible modalities beyond graspable interfaces, (2) give insights on manual peripheral interaction in general and the respective modalities in particular and (3) elaborate on paper based prototypes for the evaluation of peripheral interaction."
2176316,14040,21989,MATLAB Parallelization through Scalarization,2011,"While the popularity of using high-level programming languages such as MATLAB for scientific and engineering applications continues to grow, its poor performance compared to traditional languages such as Fortran or C continues to impede its deployment in full-scale simulations and data analysis. Additionally, its poor memory performance limits its performance. To ameliorate performance, we have been developing a MATLAB and Octave compiler that improves performance of MATLAB code by performing type inference and using the resulting type information to remove common bottlenecks. We observe that unlike past results, scalarizing array statements, instead of vectorizing scalar statements, is more fruitful when compiling MATLAB to C or C++. Two important situations where such scalarization helps is in expressions containing array subscripts and sequences of related array statements. In both cases, it is possible to generate fused loops and replace array temporaries by scalars, thus reducing the memory bandwidth pressure. Additional array temporaries are obviated in the case of array subscripts. Further, starting with vectorized statements guarantees that the resulting loops can be parallelized, creating opportunities for a mix of thread-level and instruction-level parallelism as well as GPU execution. We have implemented this strategy in a MATLAB compiler that compiles portions of MATLAB to C++ or CUDA C. Evaluation results on a set of benchmarks selected from diverse domains shows speed improvements ranging from 1.5x to almost 17x on an eight-core Intel Core 2 Duo machine."
945030,14040,10237,Query-driven context aware recommendation,2013,"Context aware recommender systems go beyond the traditional personalized recommendation models by incorporating a form of situational awareness. They provide recommendations that not only correspond to a user's preference profile, but that are also tailored to a given situation or context. We consider the setting in which contextual information is represented as a subset of an item feature space describing short-term interests or needs of a user in a given situation. This contextual information can be provided by the user in the form of an explicit query, or derived implicitly.   We propose a unified probabilistic model that integrates user profiles, item representations, and contextual information. The resulting recommendation framework computes the conditional probability of each item given the user profile and the additional context. These probabilities are used as recommendation scores for ranking items. Our model is an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model that provides the capability for joint modeling of users, items, and the meta-data associated with contexts. Each user profile is modeled as a mixture of the latent topics. The discovered latent topics enable our system to handle missing data in item features. We demonstrate the application of our framework for article and music recommendation. In the latter case, the set of popular tags from social tagging Web sites are used for context descriptions. Our evaluation results show that considering context can help improve the quality of recommendations."
2120514,14040,20561,The Value to Consumers of IT-Supported a la Carte Pricing: An Empirical Test of the Strategic Decommoditization Hypothesis,2011,"We evaluate the theory of strategic decommoditization. The theory suggests that firms can strategically utilize Internet technologies to decommoditize the products that are being sold. This prompts the consumer to make a purchase decision that is less focused on price. This is an important new direction in the use of Internet technology to sell perishable products, which are subject to revenue yield management and for which numerous variations of a basic bundled offer are possible. We use data from a large international airline firm that offers tickets and tie-in services via its online portal. The latter includes frequent flyer mileage accrual, seat assignment, and itinerary change, among others. The airline offers a set of standard branded product bundles that can be modified by adding or removing services. This design is commonly referred to as an a la carte offering. We examine sales under this a la carte pricing mechanism and compare it to sales via channels that sell tickets in the more traditional manner, where bundled offers are less transparent and cannot be modified. We develop hypotheses about the value that consumers place on the a la carte channel and on the consequent differences in booking patterns across channels. We find that roughly one of six standard bundles is customized in the a la carte channel, and these customizations occur mainly for the low-feature standard bundles. We also find that the airline's frequent flyer members and business travelers purchase high-feature bundles more often in the a la carte channel than in the traditional channel. These findings support the theory of strategic decommoditization in the air travel context."
2314868,14040,20561,Reusing Relational Queries for Intuitive Decision Optimization,2011,"Decision optimization is used in many applications such as those for finding the best course of action in emergencies. However, optimization solutions require considerable mathematical expertise and effort to generate effective models. On the other hand, reporting applications over databases are more intuitive and have long been established using the mature database query technology. A decision optimization problem can be viewed as an inverse of the reporting problem. For example, a report may tell the total cost of a certain supply chain given the various sourcing and transportation options used; the corresponding optimization problem can be to select among all possible sourcing and transportation options to minimize the total cost. Reusing existing reporting queries for decision optimization will achieve the dual goals of taking advantage of past investments and of making decision optimization more intuitive. To realize these goals, this paper addresses two related technical issues with a decision guidance query language (DGQL) framework. The first is to annotate existing queries to precisely express the optimization semantics, and the second is to translate the annotated queries into equivalent mathematical programming (MP) formulation that can be solved efficiently. This paper presents the decision queries with examples, provides formal syntax and semantics to DGQL, describes an implementation method through a reduction to MP formulation. Finally, the paper illustrates via experiments on a prototype system that the optimization tasks done with DGQL compete squarely with expertly generated MP models."
1625837,14040,20854,On icarus' wings: craft and the art of hybridization,2014,"New products and technologies increasingly blur the boundaries between humans and things. This has major implications for what interaction design can be. In a world of wearable technologies, social robots, smart environments and implanted technologies, the relations we have with technologies can hardly be characterized as use anymore. Rather, concepts like immersion, fusion, implication, or even enhancement apply. In order to analyze the character of these new interactions, we need to expand existing analyses of human-technology relations, most notably the postphenomenological framework, which has traditionally focused on relations of use.   This expansion of our understanding of human-technology interactions has major implications for our understanding of what craftsmanship can be. First of all, it shows that interaction design needs to take into account many new contact points between human beings and technological artifacts, which requires new material accounts of the human and new social accounts of the technological. We need a hybrid ontology in which the boundaries between humans and things are continuously redefined.   Second, it shows that crafting technologies also implies crafting the self. New technologies imply new ways of being human, because they mediate human behavior and experiences in novel ways. In order to deal with these mediating powers, we need technologies of the self, to use an expression of Michel Foucault. Such technologies do not only consist in ascetic practices of  using  technologies, but also in  ascetic design : material arrangements of the ways in which human beings are consciously and responsibly affected, influenced and enacted by technologies."
2085324,14040,20411,Utilizing marginal net utility for recommendation in e-commerce,2011,"Traditional recommendation algorithms often select products with the highest predicted ratings to recommend. However, earlier research in economics and marketing indicates that a consumer usually makes purchase decision(s) based on the product's marginal net utility (i.e., the marginal utility minus the product price). Utility is defined as the satisfaction or pleasure user  u  gets when purchasing the corresponding product. A rational consumer chooses the product to purchase in order to maximize the total net utility. In contrast to the predicted rating, the marginal utility of a product depends on the user's purchase history and changes over time. According to the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, many products have the decreasing marginal utility with the increase of purchase count, such as cell phones, computers, and so on. Users are not likely to purchase the same or similar product again in a short time if they already purchased it before. On the other hand, some products, such as pet food, baby diapers, would be purchased again and again.   To better match users' purchase decisions in the real world, this paper explores how to recommend products with the highest marginal net utility in e-commerce sites. Inspired by the Cobb-Douglas utility function in consumer behavior theory, we propose a novel utility-based recommendation framework. The framework can be utilized to revamp a family of existing recommendation algorithms. To demonstrate the idea, we use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an example and revamp it with the framework. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on an e-commerce (shop.com) data set. The new algorithm significantly improves the base algorithm, largely due to its ability to recommend both products that are new to the user and products that the user is likely to re-purchase."
793856,14040,11491,Improving Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering by Reducing Hubness,2014,"For recommending multimedia items, collaborative filtering (CF) denotes the technique of automatically predicting a user's rating or preference for an item by exploiting item preferences of a (large) group of other users. In traditional memory-based (or neighborhood-based) recommenders, this is accomplished by, first, selecting a number of similar users (or items) and, second, combining their ratings into a single user's predicted rating for an item. Strategies for both defining similarity (i.e., to identify nearest neighbors) and for combining ratings (i.e., to weight their impact) have been extensively studied and even resulted in inconsistent findings.   In this paper, we investigate the effects of the high dimensionality of userxitem matrices on the quality of memory-based movie rating prediction. By examining several publicly available real-world CF data sets, we show that the step of nearest neighbor selection is affected by the phenomena of similarity concentration and hub occurrence due to high-dimensional data spaces and the class of similarity measures used. To mitigate this, we adapt a normalization technique called mutual proximity that has been shown to reduce these effects in classification tasks. Finally, we show that removing hubs and incorporating normalized similarity values into the neighbor weighting step leads to increased rating prediction accuracy, observable on all examined data sets in terms of lowered error measure (RMSE)."
795863,14040,20796,Efficient retrieval of recommendations in a matrix factorization framework,2012,"Low-rank Matrix Factorization (MF) methods provide one of the simplest and most effective approaches to collaborative filtering. This paper is the first to investigate the problem of efficient retrieval of recommendations in a MF framework. We reduce the retrieval in a MF model to an  apparently  simple task of finding the maximum dot-product for the user vector over the set of item vectors. However, to the best of our knowledge the problem of efficiently finding the maximum dot-product in the general case has never been studied. To this end, we propose two techniques for efficient search -- (i) We index the item vectors in a binary spatial-partitioning metric tree and use a simple branch and-bound algorithm with a novel bounding scheme to efficiently obtain exact solutions. (ii) We use spherical clustering to index the users on the basis of their preferences and pre-compute recommendations only for the representative user of each cluster to obtain extremely efficient approximate solutions. We obtain a theoretical error bound which determines the quality of any approximate result and use it to control the approximation. Both these simple techniques are fairly independent of each other and hence are easily combined to further improve recommendation retrieval efficiency. We evaluate our algorithms on real-world collaborative-filtering datasets, demonstrating more than ×7 speedup (with respect to the naive linear search) for the exact solution and over ×250 speedup for approximate solutions by combining both techniques."
2465685,14040,10237,"Rethinking the recommender research ecosystem: reproducibility, openness, and LensKit",2011,"Recommender systems research is being slowed by the difficulty of replicating and comparing research results. Published research uses various experimental methodologies and metrics that are difficult to compare. It also often fails to sufficiently document the details of proposed algorithms or the evaluations employed. Researchers waste time reimplementing well-known algorithms, and the new implementations may miss key details from the original algorithm or its subsequent refinements. When proposing new algorithms, researchers should compare them against finely-tuned implementations of the leading prior algorithms using state-of-the-art evaluation methodologies. With few exceptions, published algorithmic improvements in our field should be accompanied by working code in a standard framework, including test harnesses to reproduce the described results. To that end, we present the design and freely distributable source code of LensKit, a flexible platform for reproducible recommender systems research. LensKit provides carefully tuned implementations of the leading collaborative filtering algorithms, APIs for common recommender system use cases, and an evaluation framework for performing reproducible offline evaluations of algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of LensKit by replicating and extending a set of prior comparative studies of recommender algorithms --- showing limitations in some of the original results --- and by investigating a question recently raised by a leader in the recommender systems community on problems with error-based prediction evaluation."
168133,14040,20332,CollabMap: augmenting maps using the wisdom of crowds,2011,"The creation of high fidelity scenarios for disaster simulation is a major challenge for a number of reasons. First, the maps supplied by existing map providers tend to provide only road or building shapes and do not accurately model open spaces which people use to evacuate buildings, homes, or industrial facilities. Secondly, even if some of the data about evacuation routes is available, the real-world connection points between these spaces and roads and buildings is usually not well defined unless data from buildings’ owners can be obtained. Finally, in order to augment current maps with accurate spatial data, it would require either a good set of training data for a computer vision algorithm to define evacuation routes using pictures or a significant amount of manpower to directly survey a vast area. Against this background, we develop a novel model of geospatial data creation, called CollabMap, that relies on human computation. CollabMap is a crowdsourcing tool to get users contracted via Amazon Mechanical Turk or a similar service to perform micro-tasks that involve augmenting existing maps by drawing evacuation routes, using satellite imagery from Google Maps and panoramic views from Google Street-View. We use human computation to complete tasks that are hard for a computer vision algorithm to perform or to generate training data that could be used by a computer vision algorithm to automatically define evacuation routes."
2018440,14040,9896,Information extraction and manipulation threats in crowd-powered systems,2014,"Crowd-powered systems have become a popular way to augment the capabilities of automated systems in real-world settings. Many of these systems rely on human workers to process potentially sensitive data or make important decisions. This puts these systems at risk of unintentionally releasing sensitive data or having their outcomes maliciously manipulated. While almost all crowd-powered approaches account for errors made by individual workers, few factor in active attacks on the system. In this paper, we analyze different forms of threats from individuals and groups of workers extracting information from crowd-powered systems or manipulating these systems' outcomes. Via a set of studies performed on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform and involving 1,140 unique workers, we demonstrate the viability of these threats. We show that the current system is vulnerable to coordinated attacks on a task based on the requests of another task and that a significant portion of Mechanical Turk workers are willing to contribute to an attack. We propose several possible approaches to mitigating these threats, including leveraging workers who are willing to go above and beyond to help, automatically flagging sensitive content, and using workflows that conceal information from each individual, while still allowing the group to complete a task. Our findings enable the crowd to continue to play an important part in automated systems, even as the data they use and the decisions they support become increasingly important."
2230903,14040,20358,Is it time for a career switch,2013,"Tenure is a critical factor for an individual to consider when making a job transition. For instance,  software engineers  make a job transition to  senior software engineers  in a span of 2 years on average, or it takes for approximately 3 years for  realtors  to switch to  brokers . While most existing work on recommender systems focuses on finding  what  to recommend to a user, this paper places emphasis on  when  to make appropriate recommendations and its impact on the item selection in the context of a job recommender system. The approach we propose, however, is general and can be applied to any recommendation scenario where the decision-making process is dependent on the tenure (i.e., the time interval) between successive decisions.   Our approach is inspired by the proportional hazards model in statistics. It models the tenure between two successive decisions and related factors. We further extend the model with a hierarchical Bayesian framework to address the problem of data sparsity. The proposed model estimates the likelihood of a user's decision to make a job transition at a certain time, which is denoted as the  tenure-based decision probability . New and appropriate evaluation metrics are designed to analyze the model's performance on deciding when is the right time to recommend a job to a user. We validate the soundness of our approach by evaluating it with an anonymous job application dataset across 140+ industries on LinkedIn. Experimental results show that the hierarchical proportional hazards model has better predictability of the user's decision time, which in turn helps the recommender system to achieve higher utility/user satisfaction."
2240023,14040,20358,Sub-event detection during natural hazards using features of social media data,2013,"Social networking sites such as Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, etc. contain a huge amount of user-contributed data for a variety of real-world events. These events can be some natural calamities such as earthquakes, floods, forest fires, etc. or some man-made hazards like riots. This work focuses on getting better knowledge about a natural hazard event using the data available from social networking sites. Rescue and relief activities in emergency situations can be enhanced by identifying sub-events of a particular event. Traditional topic discovery techniques used for event identification in news data cannot be used for social media data because social network data may be unstructured. To address this problem the features or metadata associated with social media data can be exploited. These features can be user-provided annotations (e.g., title, description) and automatically generated information (e.g., content creation time). Considerable improvement in performance is observed by using multiple features of social media data for sub-event detection rather than using individual feature. Proposed here is a two-step process. In the first step, clusters are formed from social network data using relevant features individually. Based on the significance of features weights are assigned to them. And in the second step all the clustering solutions formed in the first step are combined in a principal weighted manner to give the final clustering solution. Each cluster represents a sub-event for a particular natural hazard."
2352740,14040,11317,"Monte carlo methods for managing interactive state, action and feedback under uncertainty",2011,"Current input handling systems provide effective techniques for modeling, tracking, interpreting, and acting on user input. However, new interaction technologies violate the standard assumption that input is certain. Touch, speech recognition, gestural input, and sensors for context often produce uncertain estimates of user inputs. Current systems tend to remove uncertainty early on. However, information available in the user interface and application can help to resolve uncertainty more appropriately for the end user. This paper presents a set of techniques for tracking the state of interactive objects in the presence of uncertain inputs. These techniques use a Monte Carlo approach to maintain a probabilistically accurate description of the user interface that can be used to make informed choices about actions. Samples are used to approximate the distribution of possible inputs, possible interactor states that result from inputs, and possible actions (callbacks and feedback) interactors may execute. Because each sample is certain, the developer can specify most of the behavior of interactors in a familiar, non-probabilistic fashion. This approach retains all the advantages of maintaining information about uncertainty while minimizing the need for the developer to work in probabilistic terms. We present a working implementation of our framework and illustrate the power of these techniques within a paint program that includes three different kinds of uncertain input."
861878,14040,8385,Let's talk about it: evaluating contributions through discussion in GitHub,2014,"Open source software projects often rely on code contributions from a wide variety of developers to extend the capabilities of their software. Project members evaluate these contributions and often engage in extended discussions to decide whether to integrate changes. These discussions have important implications for project management regarding new contributors and evolution of project requirements and direction. We present a study of how developers in open work environments evaluate and discuss pull requests, a primary method of contribution in GitHub, analyzing a sample of extended discussions around pull requests and interviews with GitHub developers. We found that developers raised issues around contributions over both the appropriateness of the problem that the submitter attempted to solve and the correctness of the implemented solution. Both core project members and third-party stakeholders discussed and sometimes implemented alternative solutions to address these issues. Different stakeholders also influenced the outcome of the evaluation by eliciting support from different communities such as dependent projects or even companies. We also found that evaluation outcomes may be more complex than simply acceptance or rejection. In some cases, although a submitter's contribution was rejected, the core team fulfilled the submitter's technical goals by implementing an alternative solution. We found that the level of a submitter's prior interaction on a project changed how politely developers discussed the contribution and the nature of proposed alternative solutions."
2777933,14040,20332,Mechanix: a sketch-based tutoring system for statics courses,2012,"Introductory engineering courses within large universities often have annual enrollments which can reach up to a thousand students. It is very challenging to achieve differentiated instruction in classrooms with class sizes and student diversity of such great magnitude. Professors can only assess whether students have mastered a concept by using multiple choice questions, while detailed homework assignments, such as planar truss diagrams, are rarely assigned because professors and teaching assistants would be too overburdened with grading to return assignments with valuable feedback in a timely manner. In this paper, we introduce Mechanix, a sketch-based deployed tutoring system for engineering students enrolled in statics courses. Our system not only allows students to enter planar truss and free body diagrams into the system just as they would with pencil and paper, but our system checks the student's work against a hand-drawn answer entered by the instructor, and then returns immediate and detailed feedback to the student. Students are allowed to correct any errors in their work and resubmit until the entire content is correct and thus all of the objectives are learned. Since Mechanix facilitates the grading and feedback processes, instructors are now able to assign free response questions, increasing teacher's knowledge of student comprehension. Furthermore, the iterative correction process allows students to learn during a test, rather than simply displaying memorized information."

Driven by curiosity, initiative and interdisciplinary exchange, the Urban Informatics Research Lab at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Australia, is an emerging cluster of people interested in research and development at the intersection of people, place and technology with a focus on cities, locative media and mobile technology. This paper seeks to define, for the first time, what we mean by 'urban informatics' and outline its significance as a field of study today. It describes the relevant background and trends in each of the areas of people, place and technology, and highlights the relevance of urban informatics to the concerns and evolving challenges of CSCW. We then position our work in academia juxtaposed with related research concentrations and labels, followed by a discussion of disciplinary influences. The paper concludes with an expose of the three current research themes of the lab around augmented urban spaces, urban narratives, and environmental sustainability in order to illustrate specific cases and methods, and to draw out distinctions that our affiliation with the Creative Industries Faculty affords."
2897174,14040,11166,Popular Items or Niche Items: Flexible Recommendation Using Cosine Patterns,2014,"Recent years have witnessed the explosive growth of recommender systems in various exciting application domains such as electronic commerce, social networking, and location-based services. A great many algorithms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of recommendation, but until recently the long tail problem rising from inadequate recommendation of niche items is recognized as a real challenge to a recommender. This is particularly true for ultra-massive online retailers who usually have tremendous niche goods for sale. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a pattern-based method called CORE for flexible recommendation of both popular and niche items. CORE has two notable features compared with various existing recommenders. First, it is superior to previous pattern-based methods by adopting cosine rather than frequent patterns for recommendation. This helps filter out spurious cross-support patterns harmful to recommendation. Second, compared with some benchmark methods such as SVD and LDA, CORE does well in niche item recommendation given particularly heavy tailed data sets. Indeed, the coupled configuration of the support and cosine measures enables CORE to switch freely between recommending popular and niche items. Experimental results on two benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of CORE especially in long tail recommendation. To our best knowledge, CORE is among the earliest recommenders designed purposefully for flexible recommendation of both head and tail items."

Mime introduces a real-time signal processing framework that combines a novel three-pixel time-of-flight (TOF) module with a standard RGB camera. The TOF module achieves accurate 3D hand localization and tracking, and it thus enables motion-controlled gestures. The joint processing of 3D information with RGB image data enables finer, shape-based gestural interaction.   Our Mime hardware prototype achieves fast and precise 3D gestural control. Compared with state-of-the-art 3D sensors like TOF cameras, the Microsoft Kinect and the Leap Motion Controller, Mime offers several key advantages for mobile applications and HMD use cases: very small size, daylight insensitivity, and low power consumption. Mime is built using standard, low-cost optoelectronic components and promises to be an inexpensive technology that can either be a peripheral component or be embedded within the HMD unit. We demonstrate the utility of the Mime sensor for HMD interaction with a variety of application scenarios, including 3D spatial input using close-range gestures, gaming, on-the-move interaction, and operation in cluttered environments and in broad daylight conditions."
1003960,14040,9896,The Concept of `Work' in CSCW,2011,"The scope of CSCW, its focus on work, has been a topic of sporadic debate for many years -- indeed, from the very beginning in the late 1980s. But in recent years the issue has become one of general concern. Most of this debate has been taking place in closed fora such as program committees, editorial boards, and email discussion groups, but over the last few years the debate has been brought out in the open in a few publications, in particular in a programmatic article from 2005 by three esteemed CSCW researchers: Andy Crabtree, Tom Rodden, and Steve Benford. They argue that CSCW should `move its focus away from work'. Other researchers argue along the same lines. Taking this open challenge as a welcome cue, the present article addresses CSCW's scope: the rationale for its focus on ordinary work. After an initial discussion of the arguments put forward by Crabtree et al. and by others, the article focuses on an analysis of the concept of `work', drawing on the methods and insights of `ordinary language philosophy', and, flowing from this, a critique of the notion of `work' in conversation analysis. After a critical appraisal of prevailing myths about the realities of work in the contemporary world, the article ends in an attempt to position CSCW in the context of technological development more broadly. The underlying premise of the article is that it is time to reconsider CSCW: to rethink what it is and why it might be important."
2210340,14040,20358,HeteroMF: recommendation in heterogeneous information networks using context dependent factor models,2013,"With the growing amount of information available online, recommender systems are starting to provide a viable alternative and complement to search engines, in helping users to find objects of interest. Methods based on Matrix Factorization (MF) models are the state-of-the-art in recommender systems. The input to MF is user feedback, in the form of a rating matrix. However, users can be engaged in interactions with multiple types of entities across different contexts, leading to multiple rating matrices. In other words, users can have interactions in a heterogeneous information network. Generally, in a heterogeneous network, entities from any two entity types can have interactions with a weight (rating) indicating the level of endorsement. Collective Matrix Factorization (CMF) has been proposed to address the recommendation problem in heterogeneous networks. However, a main issue with CMF is that entities share the same latent factor across different contexts. This is particularly problematic in two cases: Latent factors for entities that are cold-start in a context will be learnt mainly based on the data from other contexts where these entities are not cold-start, and therefore the factors are not properly learned for the cold-start context. Also, if a context has more data compared to another context, then the dominant context will dominate the learning process for the latent factors for entities shared in these two contexts. In this paper, we propose a context-dependent matrix factorization model, HeteroMF, that considers a general latent factor for entities of every entity type and context-dependent latent factors for every context in which the entities are involved. We learn a general latent factor for every entity and transfer matrices for every context to convert the general latent factors into a context-dependent latent factor. Experiments on two real life datasets from Epinions and Flixster demonstrate that HeteroMF substantially outperforms CMF, particularly for cold-start entities and for contexts where interactions in one contexts are dominated by other contexts."
1185057,14040,9896,Layers in Sorting Practices: Sorting out Patients with Potential Cancer,2011,"In the last couple of years, widespread use of standardized cancer pathways has been seen across a range of countries, including Denmark, to improve prognosis of cancer patients. In Denmark, standardized cancer pathways take the form of guidelines prescribing well-defined sequences where steps are planned and pre-booked in order to manage patient trajectories. They are different from typical medical guidelines because they combine both administrative and clinical prescriptions. A key issue related to the enactment of a standardized cancer pathway concerns the decision to initiate a pathway for a particular patient. Due to the limited resources within the Danish healthcare system, initiating cancer pathways for all patients with a remote suspicion of cancer would crash the system, as it would be impossible for healthcare professionals to commit to the prescribed schedules and times defined by the standardized pathways. Thus, sorting patients with symptoms of potential cancer becomes an essential activity. In this paper, we investigate the pre-diagnostic work of sorting patients with symptoms that may potentially be cancer. We identify and conceptualize the sorting practices for potential cancer patients in the pre-diagnostic work as being structured in layers of the interrelated, iterative practices of constructing, organizing, re-organizing, and merging the multiple queues within which each patient is simultaneously situated. We find that the ordering of patients in queues is guided by the formal sorting mechanism, but is handled by informal sorting mechanisms. We identify two informal sorting mechanisms with large impact on the sorting practices, namely subtle categorizing and collective remembering. These informal sorting mechanisms have implications for the design of electronic booking systems because they show that sorting patients before initiating a standardized cancer pathway is not a simple process of deciding on a predefined category that will stipulate particular dates and times. Instead, these informal sorting mechanisms show that the process of sorting patients prior to diagnosis is a collaborative process of merging multiple queues while continuously deciding whether or not a patient's symptoms point to potential cancer."
1343291,14040,11317,Glance: rapidly coding behavioral video with the crowd,2014,"Behavioral researchers spend considerable amount of time coding video data to systematically extract meaning from subtle human actions and emotions. In this paper, we present Glance, a tool that allows researchers to rapidly query, sample, and analyze large video datasets for behavioral events that are hard to detect automatically. Glance takes advantage of the parallelism available in paid online crowds to interpret natural language queries and then aggregates responses in a summary view of the video data. Glance provides analysts with rapid responses when initially exploring a dataset, and reliable codings when refining an analysis. Our experiments show that Glance can code nearly 50 minutes of video in 5 minutes by recruiting over 60 workers simultaneously, and can get initial feedback to analysts in under 10 seconds for most clips. We present and compare new methods for accurately aggregating the input of multiple workers marking the spans of events in video data, and for measuring the quality of their coding in real-time before a baseline is established by measuring the variance between workers. Glance's rapid responses to natural language queries, feedback regarding question ambiguity and anomalies in the data, and ability to build on prior context in followup queries allow users to have a conversation-like interaction with their data - opening up new possibilities for naturally exploring video data."
1920280,14040,20332,Community Poll: Externalizing Public Sentiments in Social Media in a Local Community Context,2014,"Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are commonly used to disseminate up-to-date news information, but they also contain a lot of noise and irrelevant content. The contents of social media platforms are typically filtered by followship or friendship oriented relationships, and is almost always driven by trending news topics at the national scale, making it difficult for users to gather useful information that is most pertinent to a local community context. Research has utilized content analysis techniques to gain insights on the sentiment expressed about political topics on social media sites. However, there has been little attempt to understand how users would perceive this information if opinions and sentiments about news topics were externalized and made aware to them. We designed Community Poll, a smartphone application that aggregates local news feeds with relevant tweets about the local news topics. A Public Attitude Meter is calculated based on the sentiment score of the tweets for each of the local news topic presented in the system. We conducted a 2-week deployment with 16 users about their perception of the system. The users reported that Community Poll helps them digest locally relevant news topics, and quickly gather public opinions associated with the topics. They reported that being aware of public sentiment encouraged them to more actively participate in discussions on social media. Curiosity about a score-based representation is an important element that drove them to consume local news topics that they wouldn’t otherwise be exposed to. Interestingly, although being aware of public sentiment served to reaffirm people’s positions on the local topics, users expressed concerns about how sentiment awareness might bias other people’s judgments regarding news topics."
117475,14040,21989,An Awareness System for Supporting Remote Communication - Application to Long-Distance Relationships,2013,"Recently, the methods of conducting long distance communication have dramatically changed due to improvements in communication technology including TV phones, e-mail, and SNS (Social Networking Services). However, people still have difficulty in enjoying sufficient long distance communication because subtle nuance and atmosphere are difficult to be felt in a distant place. For example, there are many romantic partners with feelings of anxiety about long-distance relationships. This is because an environment that allows the partners to understand each other has not been sufficiently supported. The pur- pose of this study is to help people separated by a long distance to understand each other by enabling the sensing of a partner's feelings from the partner's be- havior. Our target is long-distance romantic partners. When people feel, sense, or are conscious of another person's existence or state, this ability or state is called awareness.. Awareness is nonverbal communication. Awareness shar- ing among people is very important for managing relationships successfully, especially for people separated by a long distance. This is because a partner will develop feelings of unease if awareness sharing is not adequate. Our approach is as follows. First, examine what kind of action is useful for representing the feeling of love. Next, monitor these actions in partners. Third, summarize ac- tions to quantitative indications. The prototype system was evaluated through evaluation experiments. Three pairs of partners used the system for two weeks. The result verified the effectiveness of this system as it promoted mutual com- munication."
2095011,14040,20561,Market Engineering for Electronic Health Services,2012,"Various studies have proven the positive impact of e-health solutions on treatment success and health care spending. Utilization of e-health is therefore urgently recommended by German health authorities. However, the diffusion of such technologies is currently very low, despite the availability of the underlying technology. A market failure is a likely reason for the unsatisfying situation, as there are currently hardly regular business models for electronic health services. This paper conducts a case study on telemonitoring, which has significant positive impact on patients with chronic heart failure, to illustrate a market engineering approach for e-health applications. The introduced case study is located in a southern German region, where health insurances and a physician network want to establish a telemonitoring solution. We investigate the socioeconomic, technical and legal environment in order to derive a transaction object and build a transaction service. Patients will transfer vital parameters to physicians on a daily base. Caregivers observe patients' health status and compile quarterly reports for the e-health provider. The provider distributes the funds of the health insurances according to the compliance among the stakeholders and adjusts the model on an annual base according to the realized savings. The presented solution can be built upon the emerging German infrastructure for telemedicine and be extended to further regions later."
1638489,14040,10237,Toward identification and adoption of best practices in algorithmic recommender systems research,2013,"One of the goals of data-intensive research, in any field of study, is to grow knowledge over time as additional studies contribute to collective knowledge and understanding. Two steps are critical to making such research cumulative -- the individual research results need to be documented thoroughly and conducted on data made available to others (to allow replication and meta-analysis), and the individual research needs to be carried out correctly, following standards and best practices for coding, missing data, algorithm choices, algorithm implementations, metrics, and statistics. This work aims to address a growing concern that the Recommender Systems research community (which is uniquely equipped to address many important challenges in electronic commerce, social networks, social media, and big data settings) is facing a crisis where a significant number of research papers lack the rigor and evaluation to be properly judged and, therefore, have little to contribute to collective knowledge. We advocate that this issue can be addressed through development and dissemination (to authors, reviewers, and editors) of best-practice research methodologies, resulting in specific guidelines and checklists, as well as through tool development to support effective research. We also plan to assess the impact on the field with an eye toward supporting such efforts in other data-intensive specialties."
1444855,14040,20561,"The Many Lives of an Agile Story: Design Processes, Design Products, and Understandings in a Large-Scale Agile Development Project",2012,"In Agile Software Development (ASD), stakeholders use stories to stimulate conversations that create and convey understanding of software requirements. Some authors have argued that ASD methods have limited applicability to large-scale projects because agile stories are not sufficient to capture the complexities of up-front design. This paper reports a 2.5-year field study of how an ASD team for a complex software system adapted the user story concept and the Scrum approach. The team sought to create a convention for representing agile stories which could capture the complexities of the system requirements without burdening the team with unneeded documentation. They developed eight different ways to represent a story. The core representation of the approach was called a HyperEpic, a structured collection of closely-related HyperStories. HyperEpics required 90-99% fewer words than conventional specifications. Because of their dense form, Hyper-epics were not useful for other phases in the design/build processes. The team evolved a design/build work practice that proceeded in stages. In each stage, stories underwent a one or more transformations. Each transformation represented stories differently to create varied kinds of understandings among different stakeholder sets. The team was able to gain the benefits of ASD -- faster development cycles, less documentation, rapid adaptation to insights and conditions."
1355518,14040,11166,Recommender Systems Using Harmonic Analysis,2014,"Recommender systems provide recommendations on variety of personal activities or relevant items of interest. They can play a significant role for E-commerce and in daily personal decisions. However, existing recommender systems still face challenges in dealing with sparse data and still achieving high accuracy and reasonable performance. The issue with missing rating leads to inaccuracies when trying to match items or users for rating prediction. In this paper, we propose to address these challenges with the use of Harmonic Analysis. The paper extends on our previous work, and provides a comprehensive coverage of the method with additional experiments. The method provides a novel multiresolution approach to the user-item matrix and extracts the interplay between users and items at multiple resolution levels. New affinity matrices are defined to measure similarities among users, among items, and across items and users. Furthermore, the similarities are assessed at multiple levels of granularity allowing individual and group level similarities. These affinity matrices thus produce multiresolution groupings of items and users, and in turn lead to higher accuracy in matching similar context for ratings, and more accurate prediction of new ratings. The evaluation of the system shows superiority of the solution compared to state of the art solutions for user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering."
1104111,14040,11166,On the Feature Discovery for App Usage Prediction in Smartphones,2013,"With the increasing number of mobile Apps developed, they are now closely integrated into daily life. In this paper, we develop a framework to predict mobile Apps that are most likely to be used regarding the current device status of a smartphone. Such an Apps usage prediction framework is a crucial prerequisite for fast App launching, intelligent user experience, and power management of smartphones. By analyzing real App usage log data, we discover two kinds of features: The Explicit Feature (EF) from sensing readings of built-in sensors, and the Implicit Feature (IF) from App usage relations. The IF feature is derived by constructing the proposed App Usage Graph (abbreviated as AUG) that models App usage transitions. In light of AUG, we are able to discover usage relations among Apps. Since users may have different usage behaviors on their smartphones, we further propose one personalized feature selection algorithm. We explore minimum description length (MDL) from the training data and select those features which need less length to describe the training data. The personalized feature selection can successfully reduce the log size and the prediction time. Finally, we adopt the kNN classification model to predict Apps usage. Note that through the features selected by the proposed personalized feature selection algorithm, we only need to keep these features, which in turn reduces the prediction time and avoids the curse of dimensionality when using the kNN classifier. The results based on a real dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show the predictive capability for App usage prediction."
1930773,14040,9713,Location recommendation in location-based social networks using user check-in data,2013,"This paper studies the problem of recommending new venues to users who participate in location-based social networks (LBSNs). As an increasingly larger number of users partake in LBSNs, the recommendation problem in this setting has attracted significant attention in research and in practical applications. The detailed information about past user behavior that is traced by the LBSN differentiates the problem significantly from its traditional settings. The spatial nature in the past user behavior and also the information about the user social interaction with other users, provide a richer background to build a more accurate and expressive recommendation model.   Although there have been extensive studies on recommender systems working with user-item ratings, GPS trajectories, and other types of data, there are very few approaches that exploit the unique properties of the LBSN user check-in data. In this paper, we propose algorithms that create recommendations based on four factors:  a ) past user behavior (visited places),  b ) the location of each venue,  c ) the social relationships among the users, and  d ) the similarity between users. The proposed algorithms outperform traditional recommendation algorithms and other approaches that try to exploit LBSN information.   To design our recommendation algorithms we study the properties of two real LBSNs, Brightkite and Gowalla, and analyze the relation between users and visited locations. An experimental evaluation using data from these LBSNs shows that the exploitation of the additional geographical and social information allows our proposed techniques to outperform the current state of the art."
1182440,14040,9896,Crisis Crowdsourcing Framework: Designing Strategic Configurations of Crowdsourcing for the Emergency Management Domain,2014,"Crowdsourcing is not a new practice but it is a concept that has gained substantial attention during recent disasters. Drawing from previous work in the crisis informatics, disaster sociology, and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) literature, this paper first explains recent conceptualizations of crowdsourcing and how crowdsourcing is a way of leveraging disaster convergence. The CSCW concept of articulation work is introduced as an interpretive frame for extracting the salient dimensions of crisis crowdsourcing. Then, a series of vignettes are presented to illustrate the evolution of crisis crowdsourcing that spontaneously emerged after the 2010 Haiti earthquake and evolved to more established forms of public engagement during crises. The best practices extracted from the vignettes clarified the efforts to formalize crisis crowdsourcing through the development of innovative interfaces designed to support the articulation work needed to facilitate spontaneous volunteer efforts. Extracting these best practices led to the development of a conceptual framework that unpacks the key dimensions of crisis crowdsourcing. The Crisis Crowdsourcing Framework is a systematic, problem-driven approach to determining the why, who, what, when, where, and how aspects of a crowdsourcing system. The framework also draws attention to the social, technological, organizational, and policy (STOP) interfaces that need to be designed to manage the articulation work involved with reducing the complexity of coordinating across these key dimensions. An example of how to apply the framework to design a crowdsourcing system is offered with a discussion on the implications for applying this framework as well as the limitations of this framework. Innovation is occurring at the social, technological, organizational, and policy interfaces enabling crowdsourcing to be operationalized and integrated into official products and services."
2555136,14040,10237,Bayesian binomial mixture model for collaborative prediction with non-random missing data,2014,"Collaborative prediction involves filling in missing entries of a user-item matrix to predict preferences of users based on their observed preferences. Most of existing models assume that the data is  missing at random  (MAR), which is often violated in recommender systems in practice. Incorrect assumption on missing data ignores the missing data mechanism, leading to biased inferences and prediction. In this paper we present a Bayesian binomial mixture model for collaborative prediction, where the generative process for data and missing data mechanism are jointly modeled to handle  non-random missing data . Missing data mechanism is modeled by three factors, each of which is related to users, items, and rating values. Each factor is modeled by Bernoulli random variable, and the observation of rating value is determined by the Boolean OR operation of three binary variables. We develop computationally-efficient variational inference algorithms, where variational parameters have closed-form update rules and the computational complexity depends on the number of observed ratings, instead of the size of the rating data matrix. We also discuss implementation issues on hyperparameter tuning and estimation based on empirical Bayes. Experiments on Yahoo! Music and MovieLens datasets confirm the useful behavior of our model by demonstrating that: (1) it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in yielding higher predictive performance; (2) it finds meaningful solutions instead of undesirable boundary solutions; (3) it provides rating trend analysis on why ratings are observed."
1303376,14040,20358,Care to comment?: recommendations for commenting on news stories,2012,"Many websites provide commenting facilities for users to express their opinions or sentiments with regards to content items, such as, videos, news stories, blog posts, etc. Previous studies have shown that user comments contain valuable information that can provide insight on Web documents and may be utilized for various tasks. This work presents a model that predicts, for a given user, suitable news stories for commenting. The model achieves encouraging results regarding the ability to connect users with stories they are likely to comment on. This provides grounds for personalized recommendations of stories to users who may want to take part in their discussion. We combine a content-based approach with a collaborative-filtering approach (utilizing users' co-commenting patterns) in a latent factor modeling framework. We experiment with several variations of the model's loss function in order to adjust it to the problem domain. We evaluate the results on two datasets and show that employing co-commenting patterns improves upon using content features alone, even with as few as two available comments per story. Finally, we try to incorporate available social network data into the model. Interestingly, the social data does not lead to substantial performance gains, suggesting that the value of social data for this task is quite negligible."
198941,14040,21989,The Impact of Gender and Sexual Hormones on Automated Psychobiological Emotion Classification,2013,"It is a challenge to make cognitive technical systems more empathet- ic for user emotions and dispositions. Among channels like facial behavior and nonverbal cues, psychobiological patterns of emotional or dispositional beha- vior contain rich information, which is continuously available and hardly wil- lingly controlled. However, within this area of research, gender differences or even hormonal cycle effects as potential factors in influencing the classification of psychophysiological patterns of emotions have rarely been analyzed so far. In our study, emotions were induced with a blocked presentation of pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and Ulm pictures. For the automated emotion classification in a first step 5 features from the heart rate signal were calculated and in a second step combined with two features of the facial EMG. The study focused mainly on gender differences in automated emotion classification and to a lesser degree on classification accuracy with Support Vector Machine (SVM) per se. We got diminished classification results for a gender mixed population and also we got diminished results for mixing young females with their hormonal cycle phases. Thus, we could show an im- provement of the accuracy rates when subdividing the population according to their gender, which is discussed as a possibility of incrementing automated classification results."
1986168,14040,9896,Boundary-Object Trimming: On the Invisibility of Medical Secretaries' Care of Records in Healthcare Infrastructures,2014,"As health care IT gradually develops from being stand-alone systems towards integrated infrastructures, the work of various groups, occupations and units is likely to become more tightly integrated and dependent upon each other. Hitherto, the focus within health care has been upon the two most prominent professions, physicians and nurses, but most likely other non-clinical occupations will become relevant for the design and implementation of health care IT. In this paper, we describe the cooperative work of medical secretaries at two hospital departments, based on a study evaluating a comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) shortly after implementation. The subset of data on medical secretaries includes observation (11 hours), interviews (three individual and one group) and survey data (31 of 250 respondents were medical secretaries). We depict medical secretaries' core task as to take care of patient records by ensuring that information is complete, up to date, and correctly coded, while they also carry out information gatekeeping and articulation work. The importance of these tasks to the departments' work arrangements was highlighted by the EHR implementation, which also coupled the work of medical secretaries more tightly to that of other staff, and led to task drift among professions. Medical secretaries have been relatively invisible to health informatics and CSCW, and we propose the term `boundary-object trimming' to foreground and conceptualize one core characteristic of their work: maintenance and optimization of the EHR as a boundary object. Finally, we reflect upon the hitherto relative invisibility of medical secretaries which may be related to issues of gender and power."
909542,14040,20561,The Use of Microblogging for Field-Based Scientific Research,2012,"Documenting the context in which data are collected is an integral part of the scientific research lifecycle. In field-based research, contextual information provides a detailed description of scientific practices and thus enables data interpretation and reuse. For field data, losing contextual information often means losing the data altogether. Yet, documenting the context of distributed, collaborative, field-based research can be a significant challenge due to the unpredictable nature of real-world settings and to the high degree of variability in data collection methods and scientific practices of different researchers. In this article, we propose the use of microblogging as a mechanism to support collection, ingestion, and publication of contextual information about the variegated digital artifacts that are produced in field research. We perform interviews with scholars involved in field-based environmental and urban sensing research, to determine the extent of adoption of Twitter and similar microblogging platforms and their potential use for field-specific research applications. Based on the results of these interviews as well as participant observation of field activities, we present the design, development, and pilot evaluation of a microblogging application integrated with an existing data collection platform on a handheld device. We investigate whether microblogging accommodates the variable and unpredictable nature of highly mobile research and whether it represents a suitable mechanism to document the context of field research data early in the scientific information lifecycle."
218958,14040,21989,A Model to Promote Interaction between Humans and Data Fusion Intelligence to Enhance Situational Awareness,2014,"The operator of a Command & Control (C2) system has a crucial role on the improvement of information that is processed through data fusion engines to provide Situational Awareness (SAW). Through direct access to data transformations, operators can improve informa- tion quality, by reducing uncertainty, according to their skills and ex- pertise. Uncertainty, in this work, is considered an adverse condition, which can make the real information less accessible. Although relevant solutions have been reported in the literature on innovative user inter- faces and approaches for quality-aware knowledge representation, these are concerned mostly on transforming the way information is graphically represented and on quantitatively mapping the quality-aware knowledge acquired from systems, respectively. There are few studies that deal more specifically with accessibility for decision-makers in safety-critical situa- tions, such as C2, considering the aspect of data uncertainty. This paper presents a model to help researchers to build uncertainty-aware interfaces for C2 systems, produced by both data fusion and human reasoning over the information. Combined to environmental and personal factors, a tai- lored and enriched knowledge can be built, interchangeable with systems intelligence. A case study on the monitoring of a conflict among rival soc- cer fans is being implemented for the validation of the proposed solution."
1152287,14040,20358,A Monte Carlo algorithm for cold start recommendation,2014,"Recommendation systems have been widely used in E-commerce sites, social networks, etc. One of the core tasks in recommendation systems is to predict the users' ratings on items. Although many models and algorithms have been proposed, how to make accurate prediction for new users with extremely few rating records still remains a big challenge, which is called the cold start problem. Many existing methods utilize additional information, such as social graphs, to cope with the cold start problem. However, the side information may not always be available. In contrast to such methods, we propose a more general solution to address the cold start problem based on the observed user rating records only. Specifically we define a random walk on a bipartite graph of users and items to simulate the preference propagation among users, in order to alleviate the data sparsity problem for cold start users. Then we propose a Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the similarity between different users. This algorithm takes a precomputation approach, and thus can efficiently compute the user similarity given any new user for rating prediction. In addition, our algorithm can easily handle dynamic updates and can be parallelized naturally, which are crucial for large recommendation systems. Theoretical analysis is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm, and extensive experiments also confirm our theoretical findings."
1082288,14040,20796,Leveraging tagging for neighborhood-aware probabilistic matrix factorization,2012,"Collaborative Filtering(CF) is a popular way to build recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. Generally, two kinds of approaches to CF, the  local  neighborhood methods and the  global  matrix factorization models, have been widely studied. Though some previous researches target on combining the complementary advantages of both approaches, the performance is still limited due to the  extreme sparsity of the rating data . Therefore, it is necessary to consider more information for better reflecting user preference and item content. To that end, in this paper, by leveraging the extra tagging data, we propose a novel unified two-stage recommendation framework, named  N eighbor h ood-aware  P robabilistic  M atrix  F actorization(NHPMF). Specifically, we first use the tagging data to select neighbors of each user and each item, then add unique Gaussian distributions on each user's(item's) latent feature vector in the matrix factorization to ensure  similar users(items) will have similar  latent features}. Since the proposed method can effectively explores the external data source(i.e., tagging data) in a unified probabilistic model, it leads to more accurate recommendations. Extensive experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate that our NHPMF model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
55382,14040,21989,Adding Vibrotactile Feedback to Large Interactive Surfaces,2013,"Interactive surfaces and multi-touch tables are increasingly available outside academic contexts, and are entering, for instance, work or educational contexts. A large variety of applications exists for a multitude of tasks. For inte- racting with these applications, existing interaction concepts are often directly mapped to the multi-touch surface, which is often limited by physical con- straints. For instance, to enter text on an interactive surface, most often a virtual keyboard is used. However, users cannot feel when, for instance, they have ac- cidentally pressed two keys at the same time. Research on mobile devices has identified vibrotactile feedback as an effective means to support users when in- teracting with touch screens. In this work, we present results of an experiment in which we investigated whether typical tasks (e.g., typing text, drag-and-drop of items) on interactive multi-touch surfaces can be supported by providing vi- brotactile feedback directly on the surface 1 . We compared direct feedback with distal feedback provided on the user's body, as well as their combination. Sur- prisingly, our results show that all compared variants of vibrotactile feedback had no significant positive effect on the task performance. Yet participants rated tactile feedback significantly higher regarding interaction support and subjec- tive speed compared to no provided feedback."
823185,14040,11317,Sauron: embedded single-camera sensing of printed physical user interfaces,2013,"3D printers enable designers and makers to rapidly produce physical models of future products. Today these physical prototypes are mostly passive. Our research goal is to enable users to turn models produced on commodity 3D printers into interactive objects with a minimum of required assembly or instrumentation. We present Sauron, an embedded machine vision-based system for sensing human input on physical controls like buttons, sliders, and joysticks. With Sauron, designers attach a single camera with integrated ring light to a printed prototype. This camera observes the interior portions of input components to determine their state. In many prototypes, input components may be occluded or outside the viewing frustum of a single camera. We introduce algorithms that generate internal geometry and calculate mirror placements to redirect input motion into the visible camera area. To investigate the space of designs that can be built with Sauron along with its limitations, we built prototype devices, evaluated the suitability of existing models for vision sensing, and performed an informal study with three CAD users. While our approach imposes some constraints on device design, results suggest that it is expressive and accessible enough to enable constructing a useful variety of devices."
1154097,14040,11317,In-air gestures around unmodified mobile devices,2014,"We present a novel machine learning based algorithm extending the interaction space around mobile devices. The technique uses only the RGB camera now commonplace on off-the-shelf mobile devices. Our algorithm robustly recognizes a wide range of in-air gestures, supporting user variation, and varying lighting conditions. We demonstrate that our algorithm runs in real-time on unmodified mobile devices, including resource-constrained smartphones and smartwatches. Our goal is not to replace the touchscreen as primary input device, but rather to augment and enrich the existing interaction vocabulary using gestures. While touch input works well for many scenarios, we demonstrate numerous interaction tasks such as mode switches, application and task management, menu selection and certain types of navigation, where such input can be either complemented or better served by in-air gestures. This removes screen real-estate issues on small touchscreens, and allows input to be expanded to the 3D space around the device. We present results for recognition accuracy (93% test and 98% train), impact of memory footprint and other model parameters. Finally, we report results from preliminary user evaluations, discuss advantages and limitations and conclude with directions for future work."
211367,14040,21989,Enhancing User Immersion and Virtual Presence in Interactive Multiuser Virtual Environments through the Development and Integration of a Gesture-Centric Natural User Interface Developed from Existing Virtual Reality Technologies,2014,"Immersion, referring to the level of physical or psychological submergence of a user within a virtual space relative to that user's consciousness of the real-world environment, has predominantly been established as an indispensable part of interactive media designs. This is most prevalent in Virtual Reality (VR) platforms, as their applications are typically reliant on user believability. With a wide variation of possible methodologies for the enhancement of this feature, the collectively recognised paradigm lies on the emphasis of naturalism in the design of the virtual system (7). Though widely used by some specialised VR applications (4) such concepts are yet to be fully explored in the more contemporary virtual systems such as Social Immersive Virtual Environment (SIVE). The focus of the study described in this paper are the techniques being developed to enhance user immersion, virtual presence and co-presence in a SIVE application, through the design and integration of a VR-based Natural User Interface (NUI) that allows users to naturally and intuitively interact with the virtual environment and other networked users through the utilisation of full body gesture controls. These gestural controls prioritise the emulation of the alternate equivalent of such real-wold interactions, whilst also providing an interface for the seamless and unobtrusive translation of the user's real-world physical state into the virtual environment through intuitive user to virtual avatar proprioceptive coordination."
1045823,14040,9896,Accounting and Co-Constructing: The Development of a Standard for Electronic Health Records,2011,"Patient records are central, constitutive parts of health care and hospitals. Currently, substantial sums are being invested in making patient records electronic, in order to take advantage of IT's ability to quickly accumulate, compute, and propagate data to multiple sites, to enhance coordination of health care services and cooperation among staff, and make patient records immediately accessible to distributed actors. Investors also aim to increase health care services' accountability and integration, and improve quality and efficiency. This paper analyses a Danish national standard for electronic health records, on the basis of an application prototype test designed to that standard. The analysis shows that, inscribed in the standard is an ambition to increase the accountability of staff and health care services at the cost of increased work, loss of overview, and fragmentation of patient cases. Significantly, despite the standard having been conceived and developed in a process of co-construction involving clinicians, clinicians did not find it adequate for their work. This analysis argues this was the result of the model of work embedded in the standard coming from a stance external to practice. Subsequently, a flip-over effect occurred, in which the model of work became a model for work. Hence, this paper argues that co-construction processes should not only include users as representatives of a profession, but strive to produce experiences and knowledge intrinsic to practice."
2519509,14040,20348,One meter to find them all: water network leak localization using a single flow meter,2014,"Leak localization is a major issue faced by water utilities worldwide. Leaks are ideally detected and localized by a network-wide metering infrastructure. However, in many utilities, in-network metering is minimally present at just the inlets of sub-networks called District Metering Area (DMA). We consider the problem of leak localization using data from a single flow meter placed at the inlet of a DMA. We use standard time-series based modeling to detect if a current meter reading is a leak or not, and if so, to estimate the excess flow. Conventional approaches use an a-priori fully calibrated hydraulic model to map the excess flow back to a set of candidate leak locations. However, obtaining an accurate hydraulic model is expensive and hence, beyond the reach of many water utilities.   We present an alternate approach that exploits the network structure and static properties in a novel way. Specifically, we extend the use of centrality metrics to infrastructure domains and use these metrics to map from the excess leak flow to the candidate leak location(s). We evaluate our approach on benchmark water utility network topologies as well as on real data obtained from an European water utility. On benchmark topologies, the localization obtained by our method is comparable to that obtained from a complete hydraulic model. On a real-world network, we were able to localize two out of the three leaks whose data we had access to. Of these two cases, we find that the actual leak location was in the candidate set identified by our approach; further, the approach pruned as much as 78% of the DMA locations, indicating a high degree of localization."
2780647,14040,10237,Recommendation of Shopping Places based on Social and Geographical Influences.,2013,"The project tackled in this article is a shopping recommender system that aims at providing recommendations of new interesting shopping places to users, by considering their tastes and those of their friends, since social friends are often sharing common interests. This kind of system is a Location-Based Social Network. It considers social relationships and check-ins; i.e. the action of visiting a shopping place. In order to recommend shopping places, we are proposing a method combining three separated graphs, namely the social graph, the frequentation graph and a geographic graph into one graph. Hence, in this merged graph, nodes can represent users or places, and edges can connect users to each other (social links), users with places (frequentation relations) or places to each other (geographic relations). Given that check-in behavior of users is strongly dependent on the distances, the geographic graph is constructed considering the density of probabilities that a check-in is done according to its distance to the other check-ins. The Katz centrality is then used on the merged graph to compute the scores of candidate locations to be recommended. Finally, the top-n unvisited shopping places are recommended to the target user. The proposed method is compared to methods from the literature on a real-world datatset. The results confirm the real interest of considering both social and geographic data beyond the frequentations for recommending new places. Generally, our method outperforms significantly the compared methods, but under certain conditions that we analyze, we show it gives sometimes mixed results."
1224760,14040,9896,Giving is caring: understanding donation behavior through email,2014,"Every day, thousands of people make donations to humanitarian, political, environmental, and other causes, a large amount of which occur on the Internet. The solicitations for support, the acknowledgment of a donation and the discussion of corresponding issues are often conducted via email, leaving a record of these social phenomena. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive large-scale data-driven study of donation behavior. We analyze a two-month anonymized email log from several perspectives motivated by past studies on charitable giving: (i) demographics, (ii) user interest, (iii) external time-related factors and (iv) social network influence. We show that email captures the demographic peculiarities of different interest groups, for instance, predicting demographic distributions found in US 2012 Presidential Election exit polls. Furthermore, we find that people respond to major national events, as well as to solicitations with special promotions, and that social connections are the most important factor in predicting donation behavior. Specifically, we identify trends not only for individual charities and campaigns, but also for high-level categories such as political campaigns, medical illnesses, and humanitarian relief. Thus, we show the extent to which large-scale email datasets reveal human donation behavior, and explore the limitations of such analysis."
1475991,14040,10237,Modeling the effect of people's preferences and social forces on adopting and sharing items,2014,"Recommender systems within social networks face three distinct challenges: suggesting what to consume/adopt, what to share and who to share it with. For all three cases, my and others' research work shows that people's decisions to adopt and share depend not only on their preferences for items, but also on social forces such as influence, conformity and identity management. Modeling the combined effects of people's preferences and social forces can lead to socially-aware recommender algorithms and interfaces as well more accurate models of information diffusion.   I take a bottom-up approach to understanding how items are shared or adopted in a social network. First, I conduct behavioral experiments that give insights about, and allow to model the processes by which people decide to share or adopt items. Second, I use data from multiple social networking websites to validate and extend these models and develop tractable algorithms to predict people's decisions on items.   This paper presents preliminary models for adoption and sharing along with future directions towards more accurate models. Results of my current work indicate that people consider their own preferences for items more than the recipients' when sharing and share only highly liked items. When adopting, people's preferences towards items matter, but so do annotations that accompany recommendations based on social influences; I show how their relative effects can be modeled as a mixture distribution."
1053568,14040,23827,Dynamic injection of sketching features into GEF based diagram editors,2013,"Software Engineering in general is a very creative process, especially in the early stages of development like requirements engineering or architectural design where sketching techniques are used to manifest ideas and share thoughts. On the one hand, a lot of diagram tools with sophisticated editing features exist, aiming to support the engineers for this task. On the other hand, research has shown that most formal tools limit designer's creativity by restricting input to valid data. This raises the need for combining the flexibility of sketch-based input with the power of formal tools. With an increasing amount of available touch-enabled input devices, plenty of tools supporting these and similar features were created but either they require the developer to use a special diagram editor generation framework or have very limited extension capabilities. In this paper we propose Scribble: A generic, extensible framework which brings sketching functionality to any new or existing GEF based diagram editor in the Eclipse ecosystem. Sketch features can be dynamically injected and used without writing a single line of code. We designed Scribble to be open for new shape recognition algorithms and to provide a great degree of user control. We successfully tested Scribble in three diagram tools, each having a different level of complexity."
900973,14040,422,Combining latent factor model with location features for event-based group recommendation,2013,"Groups play an essential role in many social websites which promote users' interactions and accelerate the diffusion of information. Recommending groups that users are really interested to join is significant for both users and social media. While traditional group recommendation problem has been extensively studied, we focus on a new type of the problem, i.e., event-based group recommendation. Unlike the other forms of groups, users join this type of groups mainly for participating offline events organized by group members or inviting other users to attend events sponsored by them. These characteristics determine that previously proposed approaches for group recommendation cannot be adapted to the new problem easily as they ignore the geographical influence and other explicit features of groups and users.   In this paper, we propose a method called Pairwise Tag enhAnced and featuRe-based Matrix factorIzation for Group recommendAtioN (PTARMIGAN), which considers location features, social features, and implicit patterns simultaneously in a unified model. More specifically, we exploit matrix factorization to model interactions between users and groups. Meanwhile, we incorporate their profile information into pairwise enhanced latent factors respectively. We also utilize the linear model to capture explicit features. Due to the reinforcement between explicit features and implicit patterns, our approach can provide better group recommendations. We conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation on real word data sets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
714215,14040,20561,A Work-Centered Visual Analytics Model to Support Engineering Design with Interactive Visualization and Data-Mining,2012,"To support the knowledge discovery and decision making from large-scale, multi-dimensional, continuous data sets, novel systems of visual analytics need the capability to identify hidden patterns in data that are critical for in-depth analysis. In this paper, we present a work-centered approach to support visual analytics of complex data sets by combining user-centered interactive visualization and data-oriented computational algorithms. We design and implement a specific system prototype, Learning-based Interactive Visualization for Engineering design (LIVE), for engineering designers to handle overwhelming information such as numerous design alternatives generated from automatic simulating software. During the exploration within a trade space consisting of possible designs and potential solutions, engineering designers want to analyze the data, discover hidden patterns, and identify preferable solutions. The proposed system allows designers to interactively examine large design data sets through visualization and interactively construct data models from automatic data mining algorithms. We expect that our approach can help designers efficiently and effectively make sense of large-scale design data sets and generate decisions. We also report a preliminary evaluation on our system by analyzing a real engineering design problem related to aircraft wing sizing."
2107734,14040,9704,RF-Rec: Fast and Accurate Computation of Recommendations Based on Rating Frequencies,2011,"The goal of recommender systems (RS) is to provide personalized recommendations of products or services to users facing the problem of information overload on the Web. The most popular approaches to retrieve the most relevant items for a user are collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation algorithms and in particular in recent years a number of sophisticated algorithms based, e.g., on matrix factorization or machine learning, have been proposed to improve the predictive accuracy of RS. In our recent work, we proposed a novel recommendation scheme called RF-Rec, which generates predictions simply by counting and combining the frequencies of the different rating values in the usual user-item rating matrix. The scheme has some key advantages when compared with more sophisticated techniques. It is trivial to implement, can generate predictions in constant time and has a high prediction coverage. In this paper we propose extensions to our method in order to further increase the predictive accuracy by introducing schemes to weight and parameterize the components of the predictor. An evaluation on three standard test data sets reveals that the accuracy of our new schemes is higher than traditional CF algorithms in particular on sparse data sets and on a par with a recent matrix factorization algorithm. At the same time, the key advantages of the basic scheme such as computational efficiency, scalability, simplicity and the support for incremental updates are still maintained."
1410580,14040,10237,Ads and the city: considering geographic distance goes a long way,2012,"Social-networking sites have started to offer tools that suggest guests who should be invited to user-defined social events (e.g., birthday parties, networking events). The problem of how to recommend people to events is similar to the more traditional (recommender system) problem of how to recommend events (items) to people (users). Yet, upon Foursquare data of who visits what in the city of London, we show that a state-of-the-art recommender system does not perform well -mainly because of data sparsity. To fix this problem, we add domain knowledge to the recommendation process. From the complex system literature in human mobility, we learn two insights: 1) there are special individuals (often called power users) who visit many places; and 2) individuals go to a venue not only because they like it but also because they are close-by. We model these insights into two simple models and learn that: 1) simply recommending power users works better than random but is far from producing the best recommendations; 2) an item-based recommender system produces accurate recommendations; and 3) recommending places that are closest to a user's geographic center of interest produces recommendations that are as accurate as, if not more accurate than, item-based recommender's. This last result has practical implications as it offers guidelines for designing location-based recommender systems and for partly addressing cold-start situations."
878371,14040,9616,High-Coverage 3D Scanning through Online Structured Light Calibration,2014,"Many 3D scanning techniques rely on two or more well calibrated imaging cameras and a structured light source. Within these setups the light source does not need any calibration. In fact the shape of the target surface can be inferred by the cameras geometry alone, while the structured light is only exploited to establish stereo correspondences. Unfortunately, this approach requires each reconstructed point to exhibit an unobstructed line of sight from three independent points of views. This requirement limits the amount of scene points that can be effectively captured with each shot. To overcome this restriction, several systems that combine a single camera with a calibrated projector have been proposed. However, this type of calibration is more complex to be performed and its accuracy is hindered by both the indirect measures involved and the lower precision of projector optics. In this paper we propose an online calibration method for structured light sources that computes the projector parameters concurrently with regular scanning shots. This results in an easier and seamless process that can be applied directly to most current scanning systems without modification. Moreover, we attain high accuracy by adopting an unconstrained imaging model that is able to handle well even less accurate optics. The improved surface coverage and the quality of the measurements are thoroughly assessed in the experimental section."
1279342,14040,10237,Pareto-efficient hybridization for multi-objective recommender systems,2012,"Performing accurate suggestions is an objective of paramount importance for effective recommender systems. Other important and increasingly evident objectives are novelty and diversity, which are achieved by recommender systems that are able to suggest diversified items not easily discovered by the users. Different recommendation algorithms have particular strengths and weaknesses when it comes to each of these objectives, motivating the construction of hybrid approaches. However, most of these approaches only focus on optimizing accuracy, with no regard for novelty and diversity. The problem of combining recommendation algorithms grows significantly harder when multiple objectives are considered simultaneously. For instance, devising multi-objective recommender systems that suggest items that are simultaneously accurate, novel and diversified may lead to a conflicting-objective problem, where the attempt to improve an objective further may result in worsening other competing objectives. In this paper we propose a hybrid recommendation approach that combines existing algorithms which differ in their level of accuracy, novelty and diversity. We employ an evolutionary search for hybrids following the Strength Pareto approach, which isolates hybrids that are not dominated by others (i.e., the so called Pareto frontier). Experimental results on two recommendation scenarios show that: (i) we can combine recommendation algorithms in order to improve an objective without significantly hurting other objectives, and (ii) we allow for adjusting the compromise between accuracy, diversity and novelty, so that the recommendation emphasis can be adjusted dynamically according to the needs of different users."
966788,14040,9896,Voluntary turnover in a distributed work setting: an examination of the role of spatial propinquity and role similarity in project affiliation networks,2013,"Project affiliation networks (i.e., individuals connected through common project team memberships) create fruitful junctures to understand how individuals are connected to others in their social contexts, especially in distributed organizations. Advances in technology-mediated environments further help individuals develop connections with their colleagues who may or may not be collocated. This embeddedness creates inertial pressures on individuals and constrains them to conform to firm norms and thus stay with the firm. In this paper, we examine whether ties to those who quit the firm can trump the feeling of connection to the firm and thus motivate subsequent quit decisions. We argue that individuals with a greater number of defectors in their project affiliation networks are more likely than others to leave the firm and the influence on those focal individuals will be higher when they are collocated and occupy similar professional roles as the affiliated defectors. We analyze complete project affiliation data linking 728 geographically distributed employees at a multi-national high technology firm across five years to test these arguments. During this time 183 employees voluntarily left the firm. The findings support our arguments and suggest that project affiliation networks in such settings occasion social comparisons among employees and serve as conduits for the diffusion of their career mobility decisions. We discuss the implications of our work for managing voluntary turnover in knowledge intensive distributed organizations."
2520621,14040,20561,Standardized Software for Wind Load Forecast Error Analyses and Predictions Based on Wavelet-ARIMA Models -- Applications at Multiple Geographically Distributed Wind Farms,2013,"This study introduces a standardized forecast error analysis and prediction tool that can be implemented into a software package that predicts the uncertainty range for generation resources involved in the power grid balancing service. The tool is reusable and transferrable to power generation systems of different variability. Given the multi-scale variability and uncertainty of wind generation and forecast errors, a natural choice is to use time-frequency representation (TFR) as a view of the corresponding time series represented over both time and frequency. Here we use wavelet transform (WT) to expand the signal in terms of wavelet functions that are localized in both time and frequency. Each WT component is more stationary and has a consistent auto-correlation pattern. We combined wavelet analyses with time-series forecast approaches such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and tested the approach at five different wind farms with similar or different field and weather conditions. The prediction capability is satisfactory -- the day-ahead prediction of errors matches the original error values very well, including the patterns. The observations are well located within the predictive intervals. Integrating our wavelet-ARIMA (stochastic) model with the weather forecast model (deterministic) will improve our ability significantly to predict wind power generation and reduce predictive uncertainty."
1988523,14040,10237,"A methodology for learning, analyzing, and mitigating social influence bias in recommender systems",2014,"The seminal 2003 paper by Cosley, Lab, Albert, Konstan, and Reidl, demonstrated the susceptibility of recommender systems to rating biases. To facilitate browsing and selection, almost all recommender systems display average ratings before accepting ratings from users which has been shown to bias ratings. This effect is called Social Inuence Bias (SIB); the tendency to conform to the perceived \norm in a community. We propose a methodology to 1) learn, 2) analyze, and 3) mitigate the effect of SIB in recommender systems. In the Learning phase, we build a baseline dataset by allowing users to rate twice: before and after seeing the average rating. In the Analysis phase, we apply a new non-parametric significance test based on the Wilcoxon statistic to test whether the data is consistent with SIB. If significant, we propose a Mitigation phase using polynomial regression and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to predict unbiased ratings. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 9390 ratings from the California Report Card (CRC), a rating-based system designed to encourage political engagement. We found statistically significant evidence of SIB. Mitigating models were able to predict changed ratings with a normalized RMSE of 12.8% and reduce bias by 76.3%. The CRC, our data, and experimental code are available at: http://californiareportcard.org/data/"
903035,14040,11317,Sensor design and interaction techniques for gestural input to smart glasses and mobile devices,2013,"Touchscreen interfaces for small display devices have several limitations: the act of touching the screen occludes the display, interface elements like keyboards consume precious display real estate, and even simple tasks like document navigation - which the user performs effortlessly using a mouse and keyboard - require repeated actions like pinch-and-zoom with touch input. More recently, smart glasses with limited or no touch input are starting to emerge commercially. However, the primary input to these systems has been voice.   In this paper, we explore the space around the device as a means of touchless gestural input to devices with small or no displays. Capturing gestural input in the surrounding volume requires sensing the human hand. To achieve gestural input we have built Mime [3] -- a compact, low-power 3D sensor for short-range gestural control of small display devices. Our sensor is based on a novel signal processing pipeline and is built using standard off-the-shelf components. Using Mime we demonstrated a variety of application scenarios including 3D spatial input using close-range gestures, gaming, on-the-move interaction, and operation in cluttered environments and in broad daylight conditions. In my thesis, I will continue to extend sensor capabilities to support new interaction styles."
1060804,14040,10237,Recommendations as a conversation with the user,2011,"Recommender systems provide users with products or content intended to satisfy their information needs. The primary evaluation measures for recommender systems emphasize either the perceived relevance of the recommendations or the actions driven by those recommendations (e.g., purchases on ecommerce sites or clicks on news and social networking sites). Unfortunately, this transactional emphasis neglects the inherently interactive nature of the user experience.   This tutorial explores recommendations as part of a conversation between users and systems. A conversational approach should provide transparency, control, and guidance. Transparency means that users understand why systems offer particular recommendations. Control means that users can explicitly manipulate the behavior of recommender systems based on personal needs and preferences. Guidance means that systems offers plausible and predictable next steps rather than requiring users to guess the consequences of their interactions.   Finally, there are psychological factors -- in particular, the faith that users place in the recommender system's effectiveness. Since users develop mental models of recommender systems, the system should become more predictable with repeated use.   The tutorial does not require any special background in interfaces or usability. Rather, it summarizes the best lessons from research and industry, offering concrete examples and practical techniques to make recommender systems most effective for users."

Initial work has led to the development of a comprehensive set of variables relating to different passenger groups, forms of transport and journey stages. This paper addresses the main challenges in transforming the variables into usable, accessible computer based tools allowing for the real time collection of information, across multiple journey stages in different EU countries. Non-computer based measurement instruments will be used to gather information from those who may not have or be familiar with mobile technology. Smartphone-based measurement instruments will also be used, hosted in two applications. The mobile applications need to be easy to use, configurable and adaptable according to the context of use. They should also be inherently interesting and rewarding for the participant, whilst allowing for the collection of high quality, valid and reliable data from all journey types and stages (from planning, through to entry into and egress from different transport modes, travel on public and personal vehicles and support of active forms of transport (e.g. cycling and walking). During all phases of the data collection and processing, the privacy of the participant is highly regarded and is ensured. © 2014 Springer International Publishing."
1129592,14040,9896,Collaboration in Translation: The Impact of Increased Reach on Cross-organisational Work,2012,"Coping with the increased levels of geographic and temporal distribution of work and the near ubiquitous accessibility of information fostered by today’s networking technologies has been recognised as one of the greatest challenges facing CSCW research. This trend is reflected in the development of workflow-based tools which cross organisational boundaries, putting pressure on established coordination mechanisms aimed at articulating the work of teams that include co-located and remote members. In this paper, we explore these issues by analysing a localisation activity carried out across organisational boundaries where the pressures for increased distribution and accessibility of information manifest themselves quite clearly both in the way work is specified and locally articulated. We look at how the work is realised in practice, and present an analysis based on the coordination mechanisms, awareness mechanisms and communication flows which occur both inside and outside of the formal workflow-support tools. The analysis reveals a wide variety of informal communication, ad-hoc coordination mechanisms and bricolage activities that are used for local articulation and metawork. As well as providing a concrete illustration of the issues caused by increased distribution, beyond those inherent in the complexity of the work, the analysis reveals a number of opportunities for better supporting the work and for the successful integration of new technologies."
119640,14040,21989,Study on Intuitive Semantics of Orient Traditional Creation Wisdom Contained in the Design of Modern Mechanical Products,2014,"The traditional mechanical products have been considered to be structured products all the time. The concept of priority to function dominates the design philosophy in the long term, but it unilaterally stresses technique and performance of the product but overlooks emotion and care of human, thus making the relationship between human and product dis- harmonious and violating the original intention of human for creation. Then this requires us to think deeply. In the aspect of things perception in China, starting from characters invention by Cang Jie, there were cultural heritages being good at abstraction including intuitive realization, sudden enlighten- ment and empathizing and understanding since ancient times. The six me- thods of character creation reflect the intuitive semantics or the information referred to as intuitive semiology formed very early in Chinese culture. The theoretical achievements of domestic and overseas mechanical product design are presented and analyzed firstly in this essay; and then starting with the study on Chinese traditional creation culture and practical activities, the orient tradi- tional creation wisdom that contains substantial thinking and elements related to intuitive semantics will be researched; finally, the intuitive semantics will be infused into design of modern mechanical products to think and study and survey the relationship between human emotion and technical principles, thus perfecting the innovation theory of modern mechanical product design."
2445217,14040,10237,A user-centric evaluation framework for recommender systems,2011,"This research was motivated by our interest in understanding the criteria for measuring the success of a recommender system from users' point view. Even though existing work has suggested a wide range of criteria, the consistency and validity of the combined criteria have not been tested. In this paper, we describe a unifying evaluation framework, called  ResQue  ( Re commender  s ystems'  Q uality of  u ser  e xperience), which aimed at measuring the qualities of the recommended items, the system's usability, usefulness, interface and interaction qualities, users' satisfaction with the systems, and the influence of these qualities on users' behavioral intentions, including their intention to purchase the products recommended to them and return to the system. We also show the results of applying psychometric methods to validate the combined criteria using data collected from a large user survey. The outcomes of the validation are able to 1) support the consistency, validity and reliability of the selected criteria; and 2) explain the quality of user experience and the key determinants motivating users to adopt the recommender technology. The final model consists of thirty two questions and fifteen constructs, defining the essential qualities of an effective and satisfying recommender system, as well as providing practitioners and scholars with a cost-effective way to evaluate the success of a recommender system and identify important areas in which to invest development resources."
1191029,14040,10237,Musical recommendations and personalization in a social network,2013,"This paper presents a set of algorithms used for music recommendations and personalization in a general purpose social network www.ok.ru, the second largest social network in the CIS visited by more then 40 millions users per day. In addition to classical recommendation features like recommend a sequence and find similar items the paper describes novel algorithms for construction of context aware recommendations, personalization of the service, handling of the cold-start problem, and more. All algorithms described in the paper are working on-line and are able to detect and address changes in the user's behavior and needs in the real time.   The core component of the algorithms is a taste graph containing information about different entities (users, tracks, artists, etc.) and relations between them (for example, user A likes song B with certainty X, track B created by artist C, artist C is similar to artist D with certainty Y and so on). Using the graph it is possible to select tracks a user would most probably like, to arrange them in a way that they match each other well, to estimate which items from a fixed list are most relevant for the user, and more.   In addition, the paper describes the approach used to estimate algorithms efficiency and analyze the impact of different recommendation related features on the users' behavior and overall activity at the service."
2517695,14040,20561,Different Paths to Broadband Access: The Impact of Governance and Policy on Broadband Diffusion in the Developed and Developing Worlds,2011,"A new digital divide is emerging both within and between nations that is due to inequalities in broadband Internet access. Our research examines the broadband digital divide by analyzing the impact of administrative culture and policy initiatives in the form of strategic planning, execution, regulation and investment on broadband diffusion in 139 countries. Our multiple regression analysis shows that factors that determine broadband diffusion in technologically developed countries do not necessarily have the same impact in less developed countries. For example, competition in the telecommunications sector has a positive impact in nations where access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) is expanding, but does not make a significant difference where ICT access is widely available. We also show that when controlling for measures of economic, political, social and educational development, there is greater broadband diffusion in countries that have an administrative culture of sound governance and make a higher shared financial investment in information and communication technologies. These results hold in nations where access to ICTs is expanding, even though the presence of a national telecommunications regulatory authority has a negative impact on broadband diffusion in the same group of countries. Our results suggest that the path to widespread availability and use of broadband requires different strategies depending on a nation's level of technological development. Furthermore, assessing overall government performance in terms of governance and policy initiatives on this journey is more important than factors such as the presence or absence of a national regulatory authority."
760233,14040,11317,ParaFrustum: visualization techniques for guiding a user to a constrained set of viewing positions and orientations,2014,"Many tasks in real or virtual environments require users to view a target object or location from one of a set of strategic viewpoints to see it in context, avoid occlusions, or view it at an appropriate angle or distance. We introduce ParaFrustum, a geometric construct that represents this set of strategic viewpoints and viewing directions. ParaFrustum is inspired by the look-from and look-at points of a computer graphics camera specification, which precisely delineate a location for the camera and a direction in which it looks. We generalize this approach by defining a ParaFrustum in terms of a look-from volume and a look-at volume, which establish constraints on a range of acceptable locations for the user's eyes and a range of acceptable angles in which the user's head can be oriented. Providing tolerance in the allowable viewing positions and directions avoids burdening the user with the need to assume a tightly constrained 6DoF pose when it is not required by the task. We describe two visualization techniques for virtual or augmented reality that guide a user to assume one of the poses defined by a ParaFrustum, and present the results of a user study measuring the performance of these techniques. The study shows that the constraints of a tightly constrained ParaFrustum (e.g., approximating a conventional camera frustum) require significantly more time to satisfy than those of a loosely constrained one. The study also reveals interesting differences in participant trajectories in response to the two techniques."
1664550,14040,20854,DIY)biology and opportunities for HCI,2012,"Over the past decade, a diverse community of biologists, artists, engineers and hobbyists has emerged to pursue biology projects outside of traditional laboratories. Though still in its nascent form, this DIYbio (Do It Yourself Biology) movement has given rise to a host of technical innovations and sharing mechanisms that enable hobbyists to experiment with organic materials. As these developments continue to expand science practice beyond professional settings and into hackspaces, art studios and private homes, HCI research is presented with a range of new opportunities and concerns.   Our workshop will bring together a diverse group of designers and HCI researchers, as well as biologists, bioartists, and members of the DIYbio community to critically re-envision the role HCI might play at the intersection of biology, computation and DIY. This action-based one-day workshop will engage directly with DIYbio initiatives in the UK to explore the materials, practices and challenges of 'garage biology'. Drawing on presentations from DIYbio participants who work with organic materials, hands-on biology activities (such as extracting DNA), and structured discussions, we hope to address themes such as: opportunities and implications for integrating organic materials into interactive systems; technologies that support and hinder public engagement with science; and HCI's role in the public discourse around bioethics and biosafety."
958290,14040,20561,The Influence of Organizational Factors on Inter-team Knowledge Sharing Effectiveness in Agile Environments,2014,"Agile software development is known by focusing on interaction among team members to share knowledge. However, little guidance is provided to encourage interaction across agile teams. Based on a preliminary conceptual model, this paper examines influencing factors, such as organizational strategy, and communication flow and channels, regarding inter-team knowledge sharing (KS) effectiveness in agile environments. We analyze the characteristics and the influence of the mentioned factors through a survey research method. Data was gathered from seven Brazilian agile software organizations. We employed statistical analysis techniques, e.g., structural equation modeling and cross-table analysis, to analyze the results. Within the surveyed companies, organizational strategy reflects on moderate commitment towards knowledge. KS practices are carried out to an acceptable standard. Extensive communication flow and the use of several channels denote that agile companies are also fostering interaction across teams. We found strong relationship between these factors and the companies' experience on agile methods. As companies continue on an agile adoption program, they growingly focus on long-term goals and consider knowledge as strategic resource. However, they still need to improve strategy alignment to all organization levels. Thus, we recommend that agile companies consider these factors when striving on this endeavor."

Most cases are trapped in the system due to a huge backlog of cases, excessive litigation in urban areas, corruption by the court staff and lack of proper monitoring of the functioning of courts. Efficient supervision and monitoring of courts can help in resolving some of the key problems in the system. We present preliminary results from a novel case record-keeping, management and monitoring solution that is able to meet several key performance goals of the National Judicial Policy. The overall aim of the work is to facilitate the work of the monitoring judges by helping them find the proverbial needle in the haystack and not get deluged by the volume of data routinely produced by the typical case-management systems. In this paper, we explore the application of intrusion detection techniques, such as the statistical anomaly detection schemes, to case management systems and present the results from our extensive case studies. Our proposed system, now in pilot, shows high accuracy in flagging anomalous cases, reduces the overall volume of information generated by the system and can help target several of the key reasons behind case pendency while bringing much needed transparency to the overall case-flow."
1896504,14040,11317,Midas: fabricating custom capacitive touch sensors to prototype interactive objects,2012,"An increasing number of consumer products include user interfaces that rely on touch input. While digital fabrication techniques such as 3D printing make it easier to prototype the shape of custom devices, adding interactivity to such prototypes remains a challenge for many designers. We introduce Midas, a software and hardware toolkit to support the design, fabrication, and programming of flexible capacitive touch sensors for interactive objects. With Midas, designers first define the desired shape, layout, and type of touch sensitive areas, as well as routing obstacles, in a sensor editor. From this high-level specification, Midas automatically generates layout files with appropriate sensor pads and routed connections. These files are then used to fabricate sensors using digital fabrication processes, e.g., vinyl cutters and conductive ink printers. Using step-by-step assembly instructions generated by Midas, designers connect these sensors to the Midas microcontroller, which detects touch events. Once the prototype is assembled, designers can define interactivity for their sensors: Midas supports both record-and-replay actions for controlling existing local applications and WebSocket-based event output for controlling novel or remote applications. In a first-use study with three participants, users successfully prototyped media players. We also demonstrate how Midas can be used to create a number of touch-sensitive interfaces."
1597130,14040,10237,High quality recommendations for small communities: the case of a regional parent network,2012,"Traditional recommender systems are well established in scenarios in which enoughitems, users and ratings are available for the algorithms to operate on. However, automatic recommendations are also desirable in smaller online communities which only contain several hundred items and users. Collaborative filters, as one of the most successful technologies for recommender systems, do not perform well here. This paper argues that recommender systems can make use of contextual information and domain specific semantics in order to be able to generate recommendations also for these smaller usage scenarios. The new hybrid recommendation approach presented in the paper enhances traditional neighborhood-based collaborative filtering techniques through the use of new kinds of data and a combination of different recommendation methods (rule, demographic, and average based). While the algorithmic techniques presented in this paper are suitable (especially) for smaller online communities, they can also be applied to improve the quality of recommendations in larger communities. The approach was implemented and evaluated in a small regional bound parent education community. A multi-staged evaluation was conducted in order to determine the quality of recommendations: A cross-validation (recall), an expert questionnaire (recommendation quality) and a field study (user satisfaction). The results show that recommenders even for smaller communities are possible and can produce high quality recommendations."
1396289,14040,23827,Teaching object-orientation with smartphones as digital CRC cards,2013,"Object-orientation is one of the essential parts of every software engineering course. However, according to literature, it often lacks the following: First, modeling on a conceptual level independent from a particular programming language is often neglected. Moreover, the actual process of designing or implementing a piece of software seems to be less important than providing an optimal solution. Finally, students often follow the slides of the teacher passively without thinking about or even questioning the material. But, in order to actively apply a proper form of object-orientation, it is essential that one understands the concepts of this programming paradigm and is able to deal with problems and communicate ideas rather than handling a specific programming language. In this paper we introduce CREWSpace-a tool for co-located collaboration that implements a digital version of the CRC method. To this end, students actively participate in so called CRC sessions, which fosters communication and problem solving skills. In particular, they design a software system on a conceptual level and use our tool to analyze and adjust the proposed design through role play. Moreover, CREWSpace records these analyses for a later replay such that the students are able to reflect on their decisions."
1046319,14040,422,Learning personal + social latent factor model for social recommendation,2012,"Social recommendation, which aims to systematically leverage the social relationships between users as well as their past behaviors for automatic recommendation, attract much attention recently. The belief is that users linked with each other in social networks tend to share  certain  common interests or have similar tastes ( homophily principle ); such similarity is expected to help improve the recommendation accuracy and quality. There have been a few studies on social recommendations; however, they almost completely ignored the heterogeneity and diversity of the social relationship.   In this paper, we develop a joint personal and social latent factor (PSLF) model for social recommendation. Specifically, it combines the state-of-the-art collaborative filtering and the social network modeling approaches for social recommendation. Especially, the PSLF extracts the social factor vectors for each user based on the state-of-the-art mixture membership stochastic blockmodel, which can explicitly express the varieties of the social relationship. To optimize the PSLF model, we develop a scalable expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which utilizes a novel approximate mean-field technique for fast expectation computation. We compare our approach with the latest social recommendation approaches on two real datasets, Flixter and Douban (both with large social networks). With similar training cost, our approach has shown a significant improvement in terms of prediction accuracy criteria over the existing approaches."
1039251,14040,20854,The logic of annotated portfolios: communicating the value of 'research through design',2012,"This paper examines Research Through Design as an orientation to so-called 'Third Wave' Human Computer Interaction (HCI). A number of recent critical reflections are reviewed and the 'disciplinary anxieties', which this approach to HCI has aroused, are discussed. Drawing on Feyerabend's philosophical scepticism over methods and contributions to the Sociology of Science, it is suggested that design research might build its own 'limited rationality' rather than be brought in line with supposed norms for good research or criteria for rigour and relevance of unfamiliar provenance. To this end, a concept of 'annotated portfolio' is advanced, and detailed, as a means for capturing the family resemblances that exist in a collection of artefacts, simultaneously respecting the particularity of specific designs and engaging with broader concerns. The concept is demonstrated through annotating nine well-known pieces created by the Goldsmiths Interaction Research Studio. Treating this collection as an annotated portfolio highlights, formulates and collates interaction design issues in this work in a novel manner. On this basis, annotated portfolios are proposed as a viable means for communicating design thinking in HCI in a descriptive yet generative and inspirational fashion, without having recourse to standards of 'theory' which fit design practice uncomfortably."
707433,14040,11317,Area-based photo-plethysmographic sensing method for the surfaces of handheld devices,2011,"Capturing the user's vital signs is an urgent goal in the HCI community. Photo-plethysmography (PPG) is one approach; it can collect data from the finger tips that indicate the user's autonomic nervous system (ANS) and offers new potentials such as mental stress measurement and drowsy state detection. Our goal is to set PPG sensors on the surfaces of ordinary devices such as mice, smartphones, and steering wheels. This will offer smart monitoring without the burden of additional wearable sensors. Unfortunately, current PPG sensors are very narrow, and even if the sensor is attached to the surface of a device, the user is forced to align and hold the finger to the sensor point, which degrades device usability. To solve this problem, we propose an area-based sensing method that relaxes the alignment requirement. The proposed method uses two thin acrylic plates, a diffuser plate and a detection plate, as an IR waveguide. The proposed method can yield very thin sensing surfaces and gentle curvatures are possible. An experiment compares the proposed method to the conventional point-sensor in terms of LF/HF discrimination performance with the participant in the resting state, and the proposed method is shown to offer comparable sensing performance with superior usability."
2254759,14040,10237,Hybrid event recommendation using linked data and user diversity,2013,"An ever increasing number of social services offer thousands of diverse events per day. Users tend to be overwhelmed by the massive amount of information available, especially with limited browsing options perceived in many event web services. To alleviate this information overload, a recommender system becomes a vital component for assisting users selecting relevant events. However, such system faces a number of challenges owed to the the inherent complex nature of an event. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach built on top of Semantic Web. On the one hand, we use a content-based system enriched with Linked Data to overcome the data sparsity, a problem induced by the transiency of events. On the other hand, we incorporate a collaborative filtering to involve the social aspect, an influential feature in decision making. This hybrid system is enhanced by the integration of a user diversity model designed to detect user propensity towards specific topics. We show how the hybridization of CB+CF systems and the integration of interest diversity features are important to improve predictions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using precision and recall measures."
1961771,14040,11317,6D hands: markerless hand-tracking for computer aided design,2011,"Computer Aided Design (CAD) typically involves tasks such as adjusting the camera perspective and assembling pieces in free space that require specifying 6 degrees of freedom (DOF). The standard approach is to factor these DOFs into 2D subspaces that are mapped to the x and y axes of a mouse. This metaphor is inherently modal because one needs to switch between subspaces, and disconnects the input space from the modeling space. In this paper, we propose a bimanual hand tracking system that provides physically-motivated 6-DOF control for 3D assembly. First, we discuss a set of principles that guide the design of our precise, easy-to-use, and comfortable-to-use system. Based on these guidelines, we describe a 3D input metaphor that supports constraint specification classically used in CAD software, is based on only a few simple gestures, lets users rest their elbows on their desk, and works alongside the keyboard and mouse. Our approach uses two consumer-grade webcams to observe the user's hands. We solve the pose estimation problem with efficient queries of a precomputed database that relates hand silhouettes to their 3D configuration. We demonstrate efficient 3D mechanical assembly of several CAD models using our hand-tracking system."
1256936,14040,11317,Identifying emergent behaviours from longitudinal web use,2013,"Laboratory studies present difficulties in the understanding of how usage evolves over time. Employed observations are obtrusive and not naturalistic. Our system employs a remote capture tool that provides longitudinal low-level interaction data. It is easily deployable into any Web site allowing deployments in-the-wild and is completely unobtrusive. Web application interfaces are designed assuming users' goals. Requirement specifications contain well defined use cases and scenarios that drive design and subsequent optimisations. Users' interaction patterns outside the expected ones are not considered. This results in an optimisation for a stylised user rather than a real one. A bottom-up analysis from low-level interaction data makes possible the emergence of users' tasks. Similarities among users can be found and solutions that are effective for real users can be designed. Factors such as learnability and how interface changes affect users are difficult to observe in laboratory studies. Our solution makes it possible, adding a longitudinal point of view to traditional laboratory studies. The capture tool is deployed in real world Web applications capturing in-situ data from users. These data serve to explore analysis and visualisation possibilities. We present an example of the exploration results with one Web application."
1189604,14040,20561,Teaching Digital Forensics Techniques within Linux Environments,2014,"Appropriately motivating digital forensics topics in an educational environment is a challenging task for a lecturer. Not only will the skill levels of the students vary widely, but designing a lab exercise that introduces a single concept runs the risk of requiring too much additional knowledge to appropriately describe the task or may easily devolve into a contrived example that does not allow the student to fully grasp the extent of the topic at hand. In some cases, this difficulty is compounded by the sheer amount of misinformation that results from years of common knowledge and research becoming invalid after changes to kernels and operating systems. Last year, the Honeynet Project Challenge 12 - Hiding in Plan Sight - and a computer security workshop sought to introduce some concepts regarding information and process hiding and disguising through a series of digital forensics labs. This paper will describe the components of these labs that were successful at motivating a core concept, as well as those that were not as successful and have been subsequently modified based upon feedback. These findings will be presented through a suggested lecture-lab format, and a series of scoped topics that can be used in other educational environments to motivate digital forensics and anti-forensics concepts. Scripts used to build each lab have also been provided to serve as a point of reference."
1958662,14040,10237,Towards a dynamic top-N recommendation framework,2014,"Real world large-scale recommender systems are always dynamic: new users and items continuously enter the system, and the status of old ones (e.g., users' preference and items' popularity) evolve over time. In order to handle such dynamics, we propose a recommendation framework consisting of an online component and an offline component, where the newly arrived items are processed by the online component such that users are able to get suggestions for fresh information, and the influence of longstanding items is captured by the offline component. Based on individual users' rating behavior, recommendations from the two components are combined to provide top- N  recommendation. We formulate recommendation problem as a ranking problem where learning to rank is applied to extend upon matrix factorization to optimize item rankings by minimizing a pairwise loss function. Furthermore, to better model interactions between users and items, Latent Dirichlet Allocation is incorporated to fuse rating information and textual information. Real data based experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models by at least 61.21% and 50.27% in terms of mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) respectively."
1099026,14040,10237,Finding a needle in a haystack of reviews: cold start context-based hotel recommender system demo,2012,"Online hotel searching is a daunting task due to the wealth of online information. Reviews written by other travelers replace the word-of-mouth, yet turn the search into a time consuming task. Users do not rate enough hotels to enable a collaborative filtering based recommendation. Thus, a cold start recommender system is needed. In this work we design a cold start hotel recommender system, which uses the text of the reviews as its main data. We define context groups based on reviews extracted from TripAdvisor.com and Venere.com. We introduce a novel weighted algorithm for text mining. Our algorithm imitates a user that favors reviews written with the same trip intent and from people of similar background (nationality) and with similar preferences for hotel aspects, which are our defined context groups. Our approach combines numerous elements, including unsupervised clustering to build a vocabulary for hotel aspects, semantic analysis to understand sentiment towards hotel features, and the profiling of intent and nationality groups.   We implemented our system which was used by the public to conduct 150 trip planning experiments. We compare our solution to the top suggestions of the mentioned web services and show that users were, on average, 20% more satisfied with our hotel recommendations. We outperform these web services even more in cities where hotel prices are high."
2098550,14040,20561,How Do People Resolve Dilemmas? Eliciting Subjective Decision Factors,2011,"The organization and operation of human societies involve many kinds of social rules which we all more or less obey. Such rules for proper behaviors in a society or a group are called normative or deontic. The deepest, most internalized forms of these rules govern our moral and ethical behaviors. A key concern in this type of situations is deontic conflicts: decisions where all the alternatives lead to the violation of some norms. People think critically about these kinds of decisions. But, what they think about may not be always clear. Our broad focus is on difficult kinds of forced decisions where people need to choose between alternative undesirable outcomes. Most specifically we focus on so-called deontic dilemmas, where each alternative results in some kinds of violation of a normative/ethical rule. An elicitation approach is proposed that helps to identify the subjective factors that people use to resolve these kinds of difficult choices. Our technique is a hybrid of two established research methodologies: repertory grid and conjoint analysis. We illustrate our technique using a well-known challenge problem from psychology, known as the Trolley Problem. The technique is implemented as a prototype web-based application. We refer to our technique as the Open Factor Conjoint Methodology. We identify areas that need further research in order to refine and fully validate the methodology."
365179,14040,20332,Wish: Amplifying Creative Ability with Expert Crowds,2014,"We present  Wish , a system that uses expert members of an online crowd to amplify a user’s ability to carry out complex creative tasks.  When presented with an incomplete or rough draft of creative content (for example, writing, programming, or art), Wish finds and recruits an expert to suggest a possible realization of the user’s vision. Wish contributes a new approach to crowdsourcing complex work. Rather than combining pools of unskilled workers to producing complex output, Wish uses the crowd to identify and recruit a pool of experts, then assigns a single high-quality expert to carry out the task.  This approach retains the benefits of using a crowd — scalability, speed, correctness, and responsiveness — while simplifying the process of crowdsourcing complex work. We demonstrate Wish in the context of three prototype tools.   Draft  enables users to consult a crowd of authors for suggestions on writing.   Hack  lets developers convert pseudocode into working code by pulling results on demand from a crowd of programmers.  Sketch  lets individuals convert rough sketches into fully-refined art by consulting artists.  We illustrate how novice creators can use Wish to amplify their ability, how expert designers can use Wish to explore design spaces and improve the speed of creation, and how new users can use Wish to gain feedback from experts."
1495994,14040,20358,Modeling contextual agreement in preferences,2014,"Personalization, or customizing the experience of each individual user, is seen as a useful way to navigate the huge variety of choices on the Web today. A key tenet of personalization is the capacity to model user preferences. The paradigm has shifted from that of individual preferences, whereby we look at a user's past activities alone, to that of shared preferences, whereby we model the similarities in preferences between pairs of users (e.g., friends, people with similar interests). However, shared preferences are still too granular, because it assumes that a pair of users would share preferences across all items. We therefore postulate the need to pay attention to context, which refers to the specific item on which the preferences between two users are to be estimated. In this paper, we propose a generative model for contextual agreement in preferences. For every triplet consisting of two users and an item, the model estimates both the prior probability of agreement between the two users, as well as the posterior probability of agreement with respect to the item at hand. The model parameters are estimated from ratings data. To extend the model to unseen ratings, we further propose several matrix factorization techniques focused on predicting agreement, rather than ratings. Experiments on real-life data show that our model yields context-specific similarity values that perform better on a prediction task than models relying on shared preferences."
2357071,14040,20561,Constancy and Change in Scientific Collaboration: Coherence and Integrity in Long-Term Ecological Data Production,2012,"The world of science has long been a source of new models, ideas, and technologies in the practice of distributed group collaboration. Recent national-scale investments in 'e-science' or 'cyberinfrastructure, ' continue this trend, promising to extend scientific collaboration through space (geographic and disciplinary) but also time: building new monitoring systems while opening up existing long-term records to new forms of sharing and analysis. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and ethno methodological analysis, this study explores the tensions between continuity and change in long-term ecological monitoring and collaborative research. We observe the work of producing shareable data amidst the ever-present contingencies of day-to-day practice, which must respond to two separate temporal accountabilities: coherence in the short-term and integrity in the long-term. Changing environments, broken instruments, organizational shifts, and turnover in personnel threaten the integrity of the data record, but they also serve as crucial resources for accommodating contingency and change. We argue that the success of current cyber infrastructure investments -- and many other forms of collaborative system development -- will depend on just such delicate and local accommodations between continuity and change."
1277193,14040,22021,BPRS: Belief Propagation based iterative recommender system,2012,"In this paper we introduce the first application of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm in the design of recommender systems. We formulate the recommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to compute the marginal probability distributions of the variables which represent the ratings to be predicted. However, computing these marginal probability functions is computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. Therefore, we utilize the BP algorithm to efficiently compute these functions. Recommendations for each active user are then iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As opposed to the previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving the recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the recommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the recommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a training period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset), we verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of the users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to the state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision accuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a new promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability while providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems."
1684468,14040,20524,The design and evaluation of a tool to support software designers at the whiteboard,2012,"Despite the availability of advanced software design tools, software developers are known to frequently turn to the whiteboard when faced with a specific design problem. Free from any restrictions, they engage in an informal form of software design that relies heavily on sketching. However, whereas whiteboards afford flexibility and fluidity, they at the same time limit a designer in only being able to draw and erase content. This paper presents Calico, a novel software design tool that leverages electronic whiteboards to enhance the design experience with explicit support for the creative, exploratory aspects of design. Specifically, Calico offers a grid to partition the drawing space, scraps to organize and manipulate the content, and a reusable palette together with gesture-based input to address several natural behaviors exhibited by software designers, including frequent shifts in focus, use of low-detail models, use of a variety of notations, and a tendency to refine representations. To evaluate Calico, we performed a laboratory experiment involving the design of an educational traffic simulator. Through a three-pronged analysis examining the use of Calico’s features, design behaviors exhibited by the participants, and the nature of the design conversations, we show how Calico benefits the design process as it takes place at the whiteboard."
1619958,14040,10237,"Trading-off among accuracy, similarity, diversity, and long-tail: a graph-based recommendation approach",2013,"Improving recommendation accuracy is the mostly focused target of recommendation systems, while it has been increasingly recognized that accuracy is not enough as the only quality criterion. More concepts have been proposed recently to augment the evaluation dimensions, such as similarity, diversity, long-tail, etc. Simultaneously considering multiple criteria leads to a multi-task recommendation. In this paper, a graph-based recommendation approach is proposed to effectively and flexibly trade-off among them.   Our approach is considered based a 1st order Markovian graph with transition probabilities between user-item pairs. A cost flow concept is proposed over the graph, so that items with lower costs are stronger recommended to a user. The cost flows are formulated in a recursive dynamic form, whose stability is proved to be guaranteed by appropriately lower-bounding the transition costs. Furthermore, a mixture of transition costs is designed by combining three ingredients related to long-tail, focusing degree and similarity. To evaluate the ingredients, we propose an orthogonal-sparse-orthogonal nonnegative matrix tri-factorization model and an efficient multiplicative algorithm. Empirical experiments on real-world data show promising results of our approach, which could be regarded as a general framework for other affects if transition costs are designed in various ways."

Current approaches in artificial intelligence (AI) typically focus on solving a narrow subset of problems in a given space - for example: automatic speech recognition as part of a conversational assistant, machine vision as part of a question answering service for blind people, or planning as part of a home assistive robot. This approach is necessary to scope the solution, but often results in a large number of systems that are rarely deployed in real-world setting, but instead operate in toy domains, or in situations where other parts of the problem are assumed to be solved.#R##N##R##N#The framework I have developed aims to use the crowd to help in two ways: (i) make it possible to use human intelligence to power parts of a system that automated approaches cannot or do not yet handle, and (ii) provide a means of enabling more effective deployable systems by people to provide reliable training data on-demand. This summary begins with a brief review of prior work, then outlines a number of different system that I have developed to demonstrate the capabilities of this framework, and concludes with future work to be completed as part of my thesis."

In this paper, we present a set of graphical controls intended for the coupling between the design and the evaluation of mobile user interfaces. It is a contribution to user interface early evaluation. The presented controls include mechanisms aiming to inspect their consistency according to a predefined set of ergonomic guidelines. We also report on the proposed approach current imple-mentation, and an example of application. Keywords: User interface evaluation, mobile user interface, early evaluation, graphical control, ergonomic guideline, usability. 1 Introduction The era in which we live is surely the information one. It is marked by the propaga-tion of Information Technologies. Thus, many interactive devices are designed to enable users to manipulate different kinds of information. Among these devices, mobile devices are the most used ones. As a consequence, mobile software designers are faced with many challenges. In this work, we focus on the information display on these devices. In fact, the user interface is the mobile software part ensuring commu-nication between applications and users. Thus, it has to be validated for better use and for ensuring intuitive use. Many works were proposed to provide better interaction between mobile devices and their users: guidelines, design patterns, evaluation methods, etc. [11] [13]. In this paper, we propose a set of graphical controls for designing user interfaces through Integrated Development Environments (IDE) using the WYSIWYG"
212120,14040,21989,Implications of Adaptability of Information,2014,"The visualization of information in computers is a neces- sary work in professional and personal scopes, because nowadays a big amount of information is represented, or at least accompanied, by visual representations in order to give a better interpretation to the viewers. However, two main problems are shown for this topic. By one hand the information could be of different types (nominal, text, ordinal and graph- ics to name a few) and they could come from different resources (data bases, descriptive files, multimedia, etc.). No all visualization techniques are applicable to all kinds of data sets derived by different numerical techniques. By the other hand we have the big amount of devices that the computer equipment uses to display information. This devices ranges from big video walls and immersion systems to mobile devices with a lim- ited amount of resources. An important problem that this entails is how information, been an abstract element ,could be represented in a suitable form in every device that we have available, taking its characteristics into account. In this work, a dissertation of the problems and implications of adaptability of information, a revision of the kinds of data, output dis- plays and techniques for data representation is made, in order to have a base to propose solutions to this problem."

The Impact of Managerial Networks on Career Outcomes and Influence,2012,"Social networks are crucial for gaining information, enhancing one's own influence and promoting the career advancement. This paper addresses the question which network properties explain intra-organizational outcomes at work. Following the idea of Burt concerning the benefits of structural holes, I explore on the one hand the impact of structural holes on influence and career outcomes in a knowledge intensive firm. Considering the specific characteristics of knowledge intensive firms, I incorporate the importance of tie strength and professional closeness in my analysis of organizational outcomes. On the other hand, I explore the resources gained through different tie contents. The relational resources are clustered and analyzed with regard to their structural properties. Data was collected using online questionnaires in a Swiss service firm. The ego-networks of 288 managers were analyzed, using eight name-generating questions. Two effects stand out: Firstly, structural holes, strong ties and professional closeness do enhance influence and career success. Secondly, the networks can be clustered in three different groups: i) work related information, ii) strategic information or cultural norms and iii) personal support. The results show the relevance of tie content for network analysis. The consideration of the resource flow allows a better understanding of the contribution of structural properties to organizational outcomes."
2455361,14040,20358,Rethinking the web as a personal archive,2013,"In recent years the Web has evolved substantially, transforming from a place where we primarily find information to a place where we also leave, share and keep it. This presents a fresh set of challenges for the management of personal information, which include how to underpin greater awareness and more control over digital belongings and other personally meaningful content that is hosted online. In the study reported here, we follow up on research that suggests a sense of ownership and control can be reinforced by federating online content as a virtual, single store; we do this by conducting interviews with 14 individuals about their Web-based content. Participants were asked to give the researchers a tour of online content that is personally meaningful to them; to perform a search for themselves in order to uncover additional content; and to respond to a series of design envisionments. We examine whether there is any value in an integrated personal archive that would automatically update and serve firstly, as a source of information regarding the content within it (e.g. where it is stored, who has the rights to it), and secondly, as a resource for crafting personal artefacts such as scrapbooks, CVs and gifts for others. Our analysis leads us to reject the concept of a single archive. Instead, we present a framework of five different types of online content, each of which has separate implications for personal information management."
1364134,14040,11317,What art can tell us about the brain,2012,"Artists have been doing experiments on vision longer than neurobiologists. Some major works of art have provided insights as to how we see; some of these insights are so fundamental that they can be understood in terms of the underlying neurobiology. For example, artists have long realized that color and luminance can play independent roles in visual perception. Picasso said, Colors are only symbols. Reality is to be found in luminance alone. This observation has a parallel in the functional subdivision of our visual systems, where color and luminance are processed by the newer, primate-specific What system, and the older, colorblind, Where (or How) system. Many techniques developed over the centuries by artists can be understood in terms of the parallel organization of our visual systems. I will explore how the segregation of color and luminance processing are the basis for why some Impressionist paintings seem to shimmer, why some op art paintings seem to move, some principles of Matisse's use of color, and how the Impressionists painted air. Central and peripheral vision are distinct, and I will show how the differences in resolution across our visual field make the Mona Lisa's smile elusive, and produce a dynamic illusion in Pointillist paintings, Chuck Close paintings, and photomosaics. I will explore how artists have intuited important features about how our brains extract relevant information about faces and objects, and I will discuss why learning disabilities may be associated with artistic talent."
2543998,14040,422,Rating prediction with informative ensemble of multi-resolution dynamic models,2011,"The Yahoo! music rating data set in KDD Cup 2011 raises several interesting challenges: (1) The data covers a lengthy time period of more than eight years. (2) Not only are training ratings associated date and time information, so are the test ratings. (3) The items form a hierarchy consisting of four types of items: genres, artists, albums and tracks. To capture the rich temporal dynamics within the data set, we design a class of time-aware matrix/tensor factorization models, which adopts time series based parameterizations and models user/item drifting behaviors at multiple temporal resolutions. We also incorporate the taxonomical structure into the item parameters by introducing sharing parameters between ancestors and descendants in the taxonomy. Finally, we have identified some conditions that systematically affect the effectiveness of different types of models and parameter settings. Based on these findings, we designed an informative ensemble framework, which considers additional meta features when making predictions for a particular pair of user and item. Using these techniques, we built the best single model reported officially, and our final ensemble model got third place in KDD Cup 2011."
843435,14040,20854,Products as platforms: a framework for designing open source interactive artifacts,2014,"Practices related to open source hardware and software, open design and digital fabrication demonstrate new ways for designing and producing things. In the domain of open source technology, novel paradigms emerge in which customization is combined with personal fabrication, product development is expanded by users' co-design, open licenses replace the traditional patents system. We assume that the impact of those paradigms activate opportunities for developing new design approaches that consider products as platforms: similarly to open source prototyping platforms such as Arduino, products-platforms feature several interactive layers that enable people to access, reconfigure and build upon the physical parts, behaviors and interfaces of the product. The workshop aims to engage participants in an experimental process addressed to the conception of interactive products-platforms that are open source artifacts that users can modify or build upon thanks to an ecosystem of shared documentation, services and licenses. In particular, the participants will focus on the definition of solutions for facilitating the configuration, customization and re-production of the interactive product, by discussing the limits and the opportunities of the current open source ecosystem (technology, interfaces, communities, etc.). The workshop reflects on the integration of the human centered design approach into the open source culture and it proposes a framework for designing innovative open source products."
2811769,14040,20332,Transfer learning in collaborative filtering with uncertain ratings,2012,"To solve the sparsity problem in collaborative filtering, researchers have introduced transfer learning as a viable approach to make use of auxiliary data. Most previous transfer learning works in collaborative filtering have focused on exploiting point-wise ratings such as numerical ratings, stars, or binary ratings of likes/dislikes. However, in many real-world recommender systems, many users may be unwilling or unlikely to rate items with precision. In contrast, practitioners can turn to various non-preference data to estimate a range or rating distribution of a user's preference on an item. Such a range or rating distribution is called an uncertain rating since it represents a rating spectrum of uncertainty instead of an accurate point-wise score. In this paper, we propose an efficient transfer learning solution for collaborative filtering, known as transfer by integrative factorization (TIF), to leverage such auxiliary uncertain ratings to improve the performance of recommendation. Inparticular, we integrate auxiliary data of uncertain ratings as additional constraints in the target matrix factorization problem, and learn an expected rating value for each uncertain rating automatically. The advantages of our proposed approach include the efficiency and the improved effectiveness of collaborative filtering, showing that incorporating the auxiliary data of uncertain ratings can really bring a benefit. Experimental results on two movie recommendation tasks show that our TIF algorithm performs significantly better over a state-of-the-art non-transfer learning method."
1817755,14040,9475,Robust Network Routing under Cascading Failures,2014,"We propose a dynamical model for cascading failures in single-commodity network flows. In the proposed model, the network state consists of flows  and  activation status of the links. Network dynamics is determined by a, possibly state-dependent and adversarial, disturbance process that reduces flow capacity on the links, and routing policies at the nodes that have access to the network state, but are oblivious to the presence of disturbance. Under the proposed dynamics, a link becomes irreversibly inactive either due to overload condition on itself or on all of its immediate downstream links. The coupling between link activation and flow dynamics implies that links to become inactive successively are not necessarily adjacent to each other, and hence the pattern of cascading failure under our model is qualitatively different than standard cascade models. The magnitude of a disturbance process is defined as the sum of cumulative capacity reductions across time and links of the network, and the margin of resilience of the network is defined as the infimum over the magnitude of all disturbance processes under which the links at the origin node become inactive. We propose an algorithm to compute an upper bound on the margin of resilience for the setting where the routing policy only has access to information about the local state of the network. For the limiting case when the routing policies update their action as fast as network dynamics, we identify sufficient conditions on network parameters under which the upper bound is tight under an appropriate routing policy. Our analysis relies on making connections between network parameters and monotonicity in network state evolution under proposed dynamics."
821928,14040,10237,Context-aware music recommendation based on latenttopic sequential patterns,2012,"Contextual factors can greatly influence the users' preferences in listening to music. Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discovered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to post-filter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction."
1393570,14040,8806,"Heterogeneous data fusion via matrix factorization for augmenting item, group and friend recommendations",2013,"Up to now, more and more social media sites have started to allow their users to build the social relationships. Take the Last.fm for example (which is a popular music-sharing site), users can not only add each other as friends, but also join interest groups that include people with common tastes. Therefore, in this environment, users might be interested in not only receiving item recommendations, but also friend recommendations whom they might consider putting in the contact list, and group recommendations that they may consider joining in. To support such needs, in this paper, we propose a generalized framework that provides three different types of recommendation in a single system: recommending items, recommending groups and recommending friends. For each type of recommendation, we in depth investigated the algorithm impact of fusing other two information resources (e.g., user-item preferences and friendship to be fused for recommending groups), along with their combined effect. The experiment reveals the ideal fusion mechanism for this multi-output recommender, and validates the benefit of factorization model for fusing bipartite data (such as membership and user-item preferences) and the benefit of regularization model for fusing one mode data (such as friendship). Moreover, the positive effect of integrating similarity measure into the regularization model is identified via the experiment."
1776875,14040,11317,A mixed-initiative tool for designing level progressions in games,2013,"Creating game content requires balancing design considerations at multiple scales: each level requires effort and iteration to produce, and broad-scale constraints such as the order in which game concepts are introduced must be respected. Game designers currently create informal plans for how the game's levels will fit together, but they rarely keep these plans up-to-date when levels change during iteration and testing. This leads to violations of constraints and makes changing the high-level plans expensive. To address these problems, we explore the creation of mixed-initiative game progression authoring tools which explicitly model broad-scale design considerations. These tools let the designer specify constraints on progressions, and keep the plan synchronized when levels are edited. This enables the designer to move between broad and narrow-scale editing and allows for automatic detection of problems caused by edits to levels. We further leverage advances in procedural content generation to help the designer rapidly explore and test game progressions. We present a prototype implementation of such a tool for our actively-developed educational game, Refraction. We also describe how this system could be extended for use in other games and domains, specifically for the domains of math problem sets and interactive programming tutorials."
1978487,14040,20358,Personalized recommendation via cross-domain triadic factorization,2013,"Collaborative filtering (CF) is a major technique in recommender systems to help users find their potentially desired items. Since the data sparsity problem is quite commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (CDCF) hence is becoming an emerging research topic in recent years. However, due to the lack of sufficient dense explicit feedbacks and even no feedback available in users' uninvolved domains, current CDCF approaches may not perform satisfactorily in user preference prediction. In this paper, we propose a generalized Cross Domain Triadic Factorization (CDTF) model over the triadic relation user-item-domain, which can better capture the interactions between domain-specific user factors and item factors. In particular, we devise two CDTF algorithms to leverage user explicit and implicit feedbacks respectively, along with a genetic algorithm based weight parameters tuning algorithm to trade off influence among domains optimally. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate our models and compare with other state-of-the-art models by using two real world datasets. The results show the superiority of our models against other comparative models."
872495,14040,9896,Blogs as a collective war diary,2012,"Disaster-related research in human-centered computing has typically focused on the shorter-term, emergency period of a disaster event, whereas effects of some crises are long-term, lasting years. Social media archived on the Internet provides researchers the opportunity to examine societal reactions to a disaster over time. In this paper we examine how blogs written during a protracted conflict might reflect a collective view of the event. The sheer amount of data originating from the Internet about a significant event poses a challenge to researchers; we employ topic modeling and pronoun analysis as methods to analyze such large-scale data. First, we discovered that blog war topics temporally tracked the actual, measurable violence in the society suggesting that blog content can be an indicator of the health or state of the affected population. We also found that people exhibited a collective identity when they blogged about war, as evidenced by a higher use of first-person plural pronouns compared to blogging on other topics. Blogging about daily life decreased as violence in the society increased; when violence waned, there was a resurgence of daily life topics, potentially illustrating how a society returns to normalcy."
256502,14040,20332,nEmesis: Which Restaurants Should You Avoid Today?,2013,"Computational approaches to health monitoring and epidemiology continue to evolve rapidly. We present an end-to-end system, nEmesis, that automatically identifies restaurants posing public health risks. Leveraging a language model of Twitter users' online communication, nEmesis finds individuals who are likely suffering from a foodborne illness. People's visits to restaurants are modeled by matching GPS data embedded in the messages with restaurant addresses. As a result, we can assign each venue a health score based on the proportion of customers that fell ill shortly after visiting it. Statistical analysis reveals that our inferred health score correlates ( r  = 0.30) with the official inspection data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). We investigate the joint associations of multiple factors mined from online data with the DOHMH violation scores and find that over 23% of variance can be explained by our factors. We demonstrate that readily accessible online data can be used to detect cases of foodborne illness in a timely manner. This approach offers an inexpensive way to enhance current methods to monitor food safety (e.g., adaptive inspections) and identify potentially problematic venues in near-real time."
1634667,14040,11470,Automated semantic leaf image categorization by geometric analysis,2013,"Unravelling mysteries of the diversity of the plant community is a crucial issue both for the development of many botanical industries as well as for the conservation of ecosystem biodiversity. Traditionally, botanists have proposed detailed dichotomous key descriptions (called also characters or concepts) about the morphology of plants and particularly of leaves that allow them to construct relationships between different plants and between plants and their environment. However, extracting these concepts is complicated, painstaking and can only be carried out by experts. One way to accelerate and broaden the use of these concepts is to automatically extract them directly from images. In this paper, we focus on one of the most basic and important concepts: the leaf arrangement. According to this concept, leaves are divided into four categories: simple, pinnnately compound, palmately compound and compound trifoliate. To accomplish this task, we follow a hierarchical scheme, reducing ambiguity between categories from the most different shapes to the most similar ones. The choice of appropriate features is performed based on botanical observations and validated by a statistical study. The method was tested on real world leaf images (the Pl@ntLeaves scans). Experimental results show its robustness for a high number of leaf species (70 species) and even in the presence of some distortions (such as rotation and partial leaf overlapping)."
1638613,14040,11317,DuploTrack: a real-time system for authoring and guiding duplo block assembly,2012,"We demonstrate a realtime system which infers and tracks the assembly process of a snap-together block model using a Kinect® sensor. The inference enables us to build a virtual replica of the model at every step. Tracking enables us to provide context specific visual feedback on a screen by augmenting the rendered virtual model aligned with the physical model. The system allows users to author a new model and uses the inferred assembly process to guide its recreation by others. We propose a novel way of assembly guidance where the next block to be added is rendered in blinking mode with the tracked virtual model on screen. The system is also able to detect any mistakes made and helps correct them by providing appropriate feedback. We focus on assemblies of Duplo® blocks.   We discuss the shortcomings of existing methods of guidance - static figures or recorded videos - and demonstrate how our method avoids those shortcomings. We also report on a user study to compare our system with standard figure-based guidance methods found in user manuals. The results of the user study suggest that our method is able to aid users' structural perception of the model better, leads to fewer assembly errors, and reduces model construction time."
582557,14040,23922,Fast Exact Matrix Completion with Finite Samples,2014,"Matrix completion is the problem of recovering a low rank matrix by observing a small fraction of its entries. A series of recent works [KOM12,JNS13,HW14] have proposed fast non-convex optimization based iterative algorithms to solve this problem. However, the sample complexity in all these results is sub-optimal in its dependence on the rank, condition number and the desired accuracy. #R##N#In this paper, we present a fast iterative algorithm that solves the matrix completion problem by observing $O(nr^5 \log^3 n)$ entries, which is independent of the condition number and the desired accuracy. The run time of our algorithm is $O(nr^7\log^3 n\log 1/\epsilon)$ which is near linear in the dimension of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first near linear time algorithm for exact matrix completion with finite sample complexity (i.e. independent of $\epsilon$). #R##N#Our algorithm is based on a well known projected gradient descent method, where the projection is onto the (non-convex) set of low rank matrices. There are two key ideas in our result: 1) our argument is based on a $\ell_{\infty}$ norm potential function (as opposed to the spectral norm) and provides a novel way to obtain perturbation bounds for it. 2) we prove and use a natural extension of the Davis-Kahan theorem to obtain perturbation bounds on the best low rank approximation of matrices with good eigen-gap. Both of these ideas may be of independent interest."
1084718,14040,11166,Leverage Item Popularity and Recommendation Quality via Cost-Sensitive Factorization Machines,2014,"The accuracy of recommendation trends to be worse towards the long tail of the popularity distribution of items, but items in the long tail are generally considered to be valuable as they occupy a majority part of entire data. In this paper, we develop an instance-level cost-sensitive Factorization Machine (FM) to tackle the problem. The new algorithm allows the FM model to automatically leverage the trade-off between item popularity and recommendation quality. Specifically, by adding a cost criterion to the loss function, the FM model is now able to discriminate the relative importance of popularity from massive data. In addition, we convert several well-known functions into the popularity weighting functions, thereby demonstrating that the proposed method can fit the model parameters to various kinds of measurements. In the experiments, we assess the performance on a real-world music dataset which is collected from an online music streaming service, KKBOX. The dataset contains 1,800,000 listening records that cover 5,000 users and 30,000 songs. The results show that, the proposed method not only keeps the performance as primitive model but also avoids retrieving too much popular music in the top recommendations."
2298896,14040,11317,CrowdLearner: rapidly creating mobile recognizers using crowdsourcing,2013,"Mobile applications can offer improved user experience through the use of novel modalities and user context. However, these new input dimensions often require recognition-based techniques, with which mobile app developers or designers may not be familiar. Furthermore, the recruiting, data collection and labeling, necessary for using these techniques, are usually time-consuming and expensive. We present CrowdLearner, a framework based on crowdsourcing to automatically generate recognizers using mobile sensor input such as accelerometer or touchscreen readings. CrowdLearner allows a developer to easily create a recognition task, distribute it to the crowd, and monitor its progress as more data becomes available. We deployed CrowdLearner to a crowd of 72 mobile users over a period of 2.5 weeks. We evaluated the system by experimenting with 6 recognition tasks concerning motion gestures, touchscreen gestures, and activity recognition. The experimental results indicated that CrowdLearner enables a developer to quickly acquire a usable recognizer for their specific application by spending a moderate amount of money, often less than $10, in a short period of time, often in the order of 2 hours. Our exploration also revealed challenges and provided insights into the design of future crowdsourcing systems for machine learning tasks."
19104,14040,20332,Deep modeling of group preferences for group-based recommendation,2014,"Nowadays, most recommender systems (RSs) mainly aim to s suggest appropriate items for individuals. Due to the social nature of human beings, group activities have become an integral part of our daily life, thus motivating the study on group RS (GRS). However, most existing methods used by GRS make recommendations through aggregating individual ratings or individual predictive results rather than considering the collective features that govern user choices made within a group. As a result, such methods are heavily sensitive to data, hence they often fail to learn group preferences when the data are slightly inconsistent with predefined aggregation assumptions. To this end, we devise a novel GRS approach which accommodates both individual choices and group decisions in a joint model. More specifically, we propose a deep-architecture model built with collective deep belief networks and dual-wing restricted Boltzmann machines. With such a deep model, we can use high-level features, which are induced from lower-level features, to represent group preference so as to relieve the vulnerability of data. Finally, the experiments conducted on a real-world dataset prove the superiority of our deep model over other state-of-the-art methods."
1155252,14040,20358,Social bootstrapping: how pinterest and last.fm social communities benefit by borrowing links from facebook,2014,"How does one develop a new online community that is highly engaging to each user and promotes social interaction? A number of websites offer friend-finding features that help users bootstrap social networks on the website by copying links from an established network like Facebook or Twitter. This paper quantifies the extent to which such social bootstrapping is effective in enhancing a social experience of the website. First, we develop a stylised analytical model that suggests that copying tends to produce a giant connected component (i.e., a connected community) quickly and preserves properties such as reciprocity and clustering, up to a linear multiplicative factor. Second, we use data from two websites, Pinterest and Last.fm, to empirically compare the subgraph of links copied from Facebook to links created natively. We find that the copied subgraph has a giant component, higher reciprocity and clustering, and confirm that the copied connections see higher social interactions. However, the need for copying diminishes as users become more active and influential. Such users tend to create links natively on the website, to users who are more similar to them than their Facebook friends. Our findings give new insights into understanding how bootstrapping from established social networks can help engage new users by enhancing social interactivity."
1927688,14040,10237,"Using canonical correlation analysis for generalized sentiment analysis, product recommendation and search",2011,"Standard Sentiment Analysis applies Natural Language Processing methods to assess an approval value of a given text, categorizing it into negative, neutral, or positive or on a linear scale. Sentiment Analysis can be used to infer ratings values for users based on textual reviews of items such as books, films, or products. We propose an approach to generalizing the concept to multiple dimensions to estimate user ratings along multiple axes such as service, price and value. We use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and derive a mathematical model that can be used as a multivariate regression tool. This model has a number of valuable properties: it can be trained offline and used efficiently on live stream of texts like blogs and tweets, can be used for visualization and data clustering and labeling, and finally it can potentially be incorporated into natural language product search algorithms. At the end we propose an evaluation procedure that can be used on live data when a ground truth is not available. Based on this model we present our preliminary results from empirical data that we have collected from our system Opinion Space1. We show that for this dataset the CCA model outperforms the PCA that was originally used in Opinion Space."
1120011,14040,10237,Movie recommender system for profit maximization,2013,"Traditional recommender systems minimize prediction error with respect to users' choices. Recent studies have shown that recommender systems have a positive effect on the provider's revenue.   In this paper we show that by providing a set of recommendations different than the one perceived best according to user acceptance rate, the recommendation system can further increase the business' utility (e.g. revenue), without any significant drop in user satisfaction. Indeed, the recommendation system designer should have in mind both the user, whose taste we need to reveal, and the business, which wants to promote specific content.   We performed a large body of experiments comparing a commercial state-of-the-art recommendation engine with a modified recommendation list, which takes into account the utility (or revenue) which the business obtains from each suggestion that is accepted by the user. We show that the modified recommendation list is more desirable for the business, as the end result gives the business a higher utility (or revenue). To study possible reduce in satisfaction by providing the user worse suggestions, we asked the users how they perceive the list of recommendation that they received. Differences in user satisfaction between the lists is negligible, and not statistically significant.   We also uncover a phenomenon where movie consumers prefer watching and even paying for movies that they have already seen in the past than movies that are new to them."
1321607,14040,20561,The Impact of Variable Market Price on Optimal Control of Wind-Hydro Storage System in Kenya,2014,"The Lake Turkana Wind Power Project (LTWP) in Northern Kenya is currently under development, scheduled to bring 300MW of wind generation online by the end of 2016. The economic issues raised by the structure of the Kenyan electricity market include a fixed feed-in tariff for the wind generators on the system, and a strict Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). This agreement appears to significantly constrain the ability of the Kenya Power Company to operate the power system in a reliable and efficient manner. This paper analyzes the impact of different price policies on the operation of the LTWP coupled with pumped hydro storage. In particular the modeling results compare the system behavior when operating under the fixed price regime versus dynamic pricing defined by use of locational marginal prices. In addition, benefits from allowing the Kenya Power Company to spill wind as needed, rather than a strict requirement to take all wind power generated are investigated. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of system-driven prices produce a significantly different operational strategy than the fixed price model. Results also show that the exclusion of dispatch flexibility in the form of wind curtailment results in increased price volatility, particularly during periods of high winds."
2314029,14040,20358,New objective functions for social collaborative filtering,2012,"This paper examines the problem of social collaborative filtering (CF) to recommend items of interest to users in a social network setting. Unlike standard CF algorithms using relatively simple user and item features, recommendation in social networks poses the more complex problem of learning user preferences from a rich and complex set of user profile and interaction information. Many existing social CF methods have extended traditional CF matrix factorization, but have overlooked important aspects germane to the social setting. We propose a unified framework for social CF matrix factorization by introducing novel objective functions for training. Our new objective functions have three key features that address main drawbacks of existing approaches: (a) we fully exploit feature-based user similarity, (b) we permit direct learning of user-to-user information diffusion, and (c) we leverage co-preference (dis)agreement between two users to learn restricted areas of common interest. We evaluate these new social CF objectives, comparing them to each other and to a variety of (social) CF baselines, and analyze user behavior on live user trials in a custom-developed Facebook App involving data collected over five months from over 100 App users and their 37,000+ friends."
2474161,14040,20854,Showing is sharing: building shared understanding in human-centered design teams with Dazzle,2012,"Human-centered design teams must integrate diverse individual perspectives into a shared understanding during conceptual design. The team's shared knowledge of their users becomes the basis for later design decisions. We conducted a formative study that shows how generic groupware is insufficient to support the transition from individual to collaborative creative work. We developed a set of design guidelines and implemented them in Dazzle, a collaborative shared display system for co-located design team meetings. Dazzle associates the action of showing information on the shared display with granting the rest of the team access to that information:  showing is sharing . Dazzle also records a history of shown files. Team members can annotate this log using cross-platform synchronized clients. Teams of novice designers tested Dazzle over two consecutive sessions: the first focused on synthesizing user research, and the second focused on brainstorming. Dazzle was very effective at grounding team conversations about user research, but was used less for sharing information during brainstorming tasks. Items from the shared activity log were used as sources of inspiration and decision criteria during the brainstorming task. Future work includes additional support for active decision-making, and ambient feedback on design activity."
1073347,14040,20358,Targeting converters for new campaigns through factor models,2012,"In performance based display advertising, campaign effectiveness is often measured in terms of conversions that represent some desired user actions like purchases and product information requests on advertisers' website. Hence, identifying and targeting potential converters is of vital importance to boost campaign performance. This is often accomplished by marketers who define the user base of campaigns based on behavioral, demographic, search, social, purchase, and other characteristics. Such a process is manual and subjective, it often fails to utilize the full potential of targeting. In this paper we show that by using past converted users of campaigns and campaign meta-data (e.g., ad creatives, landing pages), we can combine disparate user information in a principled way to effectively and automatically target converters for new/existing campaigns. At the heart of our approach is a factor model that estimates the affinity of each user feature to a campaign using historical conversion data. In fact, our approach allows building a conversion model for a brand new campaign through campaign meta-data alone, and hence targets potential converters even before the campaign is run. Through extensive experiments, we show the superiority of our factor model approach relative to several other baselines. Moreover, we show that the performance of our approach at the beginning of a campaign's life is typically better than the other models even when they are trained using all conversion data after the campaign has completed. This clearly shows the importance and value of using historical campaign data in constructing an effective audience selection strategy for display advertising."
2180443,14040,20561,Combining Structured and Unstructured Information Sources for a Study of Data Quality: A Case Study of Zillow.Com,2011,"Zillow is a web-based, leading real-estate information service in the US. We studied user-contributed facts in a sample of Zillow records. User-contributed information seems to improve the completeness and the level of detail of the information on Zillow.com. However, the accuracy of user-contributed facts may not be high. An investigation of the sources of error revealed several weaknesses, including conceptual challenges, information integration failures, and design deficiencies. A lack of shared, user-friendly, conceptual foundation has been found to be a significant drawback. In part, errors are a product of Zillow's wide geographic coverage and highly networked operation. In addition, important peculiarities of a property are often unknown to the public. Information about such peculiarities is typically shared by a small group of people, whose levels of expertise and stakes in that property, and in real estate in general, may differ. This environment poses a challenge for harnessing the collective intelligence. The results demonstrate the success of our unique evaluation strategy, which utilizes a systematic review of a rich set of online sources. A similar strategy may also be useful for large-scale error detection and correction, if an efficient automated equivalent is developed to implement it."
933308,14040,20561,Introduction to Social Networking and Communities Minitrack,2012,"This minitrack has been ongoing under various titles since 2003. Over those years, our emphasis has continued to be on exploring how social media - internet, email, twitter, blogs, social networking, and more - affect the development and support of community-based endeavors. We consider community quite broadly to include work and learning groups, as well as more general social collectives. The empirical and theoretical papers that make up this minitrack address online communities of practice, inquiry, and interest relating to political, educational, business, social, and/or gaming pursuits, with attention to how online community building and management contribute to success in the digital economy and society. While the focus is primarily directed to online communities, papers also address the important interplay between online and offline worlds. The minitrack continues to attract a lot of interest and this year nine papers were selected following peer review of 21 submissions (43% acceptance rate). Papers this year examine issues of psychology and behavior, e.g., in papers on addiction, flaming, and unfriending, Crossover effects between the online and offline worlds, e.g., for those out of work, and those in academia, Learning and information exchange online, And effects and results of in-world, in-community online behavior."
1530773,14040,9896,Path dependent network advantage,2013,"We analyze network volatility as something akin to the hum of a running engine. People active in a network produce vibration and wiggle where the connections and the network structure around these people changes frequently. We want to know how that vibration and wiggle affects their network advantage. We distinguish four dimensions to network volatility (churn, variation, trend, and reversals), measure them with panel data on a population of bankers, then add them to analysis predicting compensation from status and structural-hole measures of network advantage. We find that volatility does not affect performance directly. It creates a slope adjustment that enhances the returns to network advantage. We identify two stability traps that destroy advantage, but the key is not to avoid the traps so much as to avoid them in a particular way. The volatility that enhances is reversal: a pattern in which network advantage is lost then regained, producing oscillations in network metrics, as would be produced by a behavioral pattern of serial closure over time. Bankers who go through reversals enjoy significantly higher returns to their network advantage. In the absence of reversals, in fact, there are no returns to network advantage. We infer a serial closure hypothesis in which reversals are the result of bankers engaging and disengaging closed networks. Networks built through serial closure provide advantage well beyond the level expected from structure alone. We present evidence consistent with the hypothesis, but testing remains for future research. What we can say here is that the way a network develops has substantial implications for the advantage it provides."
642225,14040,20332,Context Trees: Crowdsourcing Global Understanding from Local Views,2014,"Crowdsourcing struggles when workers must see all of the pieces of input to make an accurate judgment. For example, to find the most important scenes in a novel or movie, each worker must spend hours consuming the entire plot to acquire a global understanding and then apply that understanding to each local scene. To enable the crowdsourcing of large-scale goals with only local views, we introduce context trees, a crowdsourcing workflow for creating global summaries of a large input. Context trees recursively combine elements through written summaries to form a tree. Workers can then ground their local decisions by applying those summaries back down to the leaf nodes. In the case of scale ratings such as scene importance, we introduce a weighting process that percolates ratings downwards through the tree so that important nodes in unimportant branches are not overweighted. When using context trees to rate the importance of scenes in a 4000-word story and a 100-minute movie, workers’ ratings are nearly as accurate as those who saw the entire input, and much improved over the traditional approach of splitting the input into independent segments. To explore whether context trees enable crowdsourcing to undertake new classes of goals, we also crowdsource the solution to a large hierarchical puzzle of 462,000 interlocking pieces."
2643152,14040,20332,Plan recognition for exploratory domains using interleaved temporal search,2013,"In exploratory domains, agents' actions map onto logs of behavior that include switching between activities, extraneous actions, and mistakes. These aspects create a challenging plan recognition problem. This paper presents a new algorithm for inferring students' activities in exploratory domains that is evaluated empirically using a new type of flexible and open-ended educational software for science education. Such software has been shown to provide a rich educational environment for students, but challenge teachers to keep track of students' progress and to assess their performance. The algorithm decomposes students complete interaction histories to create hierarchies of interdependent tasks that describe their activities using the software. It matches students' actions to a predefined grammar in a way that reflects that students solve problems in a modular fashion but may still interleave between their activities. The algorithm was empirically evaluated on peoples interaction with two separate software systems for simulating a chemistry laboratory and for statistics education. It was separately compared to the state-of-the-art recognition algorithms for each of the software. The results show that the algorithm was able to correctly infer students' activities significantly more often than the state-of-the-art, and was able to generalize to both of the software systems with no intervention."
704410,14040,10237,"Tell me where to go and what to do next, but do not bother me",2014,"In this demonstration, we present a system that recommends to the user the locations and activities she/he might be interested in according to history GPS trajectories and public places of interest (POI) data. Its innovation lies in the acceptable performance of recommendations in cases where no user comments on activity types are available. Such situations are more realistic considering the restrictions on mobile devices' abilities, users' privacies, or business secret. For this purpose, we first extract stay points according to uses' trajectories, and label them with the top-k common activities which have the most possibility in terms of the POI dataset. Then, by taking stay points as observations, and activities as hidden states, a Hidden Markov model is built to learn the transfer possibilities between activities and the generation probabilities between activities and stay points. Finally, with the obtained model, our system can perform two types of recommendation, i.e. the history based recommendation and the similarity based recommendation. The results of former type are those stay points from user's own history positions. While, the latter one conducts collaborative filtering by taking history based recommendation results from similar users. The demonstration shows the running effects of the implemented prototype system, in which the Microsoft GeoLife trajectories dataset and the DianPing.com POI dataset were loaded. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility."
1364183,14040,9896,Unearthing the Infrastructure: Humans and Sensors in Field-Based Scientific Research,2013,"Distributed sensing systems for studying scientific phenomena are critical applications of information technologies. By embedding computational intelligence in the environment of study, sensing systems allow researchers to study phenomena at spatial and temporal scales that were previously impossible to achieve. We present an ethnographic study of field research practices among researchers in the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS), a National Science Foundation Science & Technology Center devoted to developing wireless sensing systems for scientific and social applications. Using the concepts of boundary objects and trading zones, we trace the processes of collaborative research around sensor technology development and adoption within CENS. Over the 10-year lifespan of CENS, sensor technologies, sensor data, field research methods, and statistical expertise each emerged as boundary objects that were understood differently by the science and technology partners. We illustrate how sensing technologies were incompatible with field-based environmental research until researchers unearthed their infrastructures, explicitly reintroducing human skill and expertise into the data collection process and developing new collaborative languages that emphasized building dynamic sensing systems that addressed human needs. In collaborating around a dynamic sensing model, the sensing systems became embedded not in the environment of study, but in the practices of the scientists."
732503,14040,9896,People in books: using a FlashCam to become part of an interactive book for connected reading,2012,"We introduce People in Books with FlashCam technology, a system that supports children and long-distance family members to act as characters in children's storybooks while they read stories together over a distance. By segmenting the video chat streams of the child and remote family member from their background surroundings, we create the illusion that the child and adult reader are immersed among the storybook illustrations. The illusion of inhabiting a shared story environment helps remote family members feel a sense of togetherness and encourages active reading behaviors for children ages three to five. People In Books is designed to fit into families' traditional reading practices, such as reading ebooks on couches or in bed via netbook or tablet computers. To accommodate this goal we implemented FlashCam, a computationally cost effective and physically small background subtraction system for mobile devices that allows users to move locations and change lighting conditions while they engage in background-subtracted video communications. A lab evaluation compared People in Books with a conventional remote reading application. Results show that People in Books motivates parents and children to be more performative readers and encourages open-ended play beyond the story, while creating a strong sense of togetherness."
2602181,14040,21989,Comparisons of Computer Exposure and Forearm Musculoskeletal Symptoms among Three Computer Groups-The Application of an External Logger,2013,"This study aim was to compare the computer exposure and forearm musculoskeletal symptoms among three computer use groups by an external logger. 30 participants were recruited in this study and divided into three groups: 10 computer-document (CD) processors, 10 computer-aided design (CAD) draftsmen, and 10 online gamers. Computer use of each participant was recorded for 10 consecutive days. Questionnaire survey was conducted to collect musculoskeletal complaints in participants' upper limbs right after data collection period. Quantitative parameters computed using recorded data were daily keystrokes, mouse clicks, wheel scrolling counts, mouse movement and dragged distance. Experimental results showed that the online gamers had the significantly higher keyboard activities than typical keyboard users, CD processors. Also, it had the higher mouse activities than the typical mouse users, CAD draftsmen. However, musculoskeletal complaint in their upper limbs was not greater than that of CD processors and CAD draftsmen. There existed a complicate relationship between cumulative hazards and computer uses. Experimental results indicated that computer use duration alone could not accurately represent the workloads of various computer tasks. Adequate tools are needed for quantifying user computer exposure and providing detailed information for various computer tasks."
708670,14040,20561,Introduction to Network Analysis of Social and Digital Media Minitrack,2014,"Social networks are representation of complex systems defined by the patterns of relationships among a system's components. Networks are created by information flows or other relations among entities through time and space. The goal of network analysis is to describe the structure of a higher-level system based on the pattern of linkages among a set of lower level nodes, and how this structure changes over time. It differs from traditional research by focusing on relationships rather than the attributes of individuals. The complex social networks that people create and manage are dynamic, multi-modal, and increasingly mediated by social and digital media.Network science has progressed in parallel with the development of social and digital media, computers and other information systems. This has provided social and communication network scientists with precise representations of information flows and advanced the state of the science. Additionally, the increased theoretical understanding and analytic representation of computer and information systems provides developers with a greater sense of how people and organizations utilize technology to manage resources embedded in their social and digital networks. The papers in this minitrack represent theoretical and analytic developments in social and digital media research. They focus on new media and information technology, or use new media data in the analysis. They cross disciplines and levels of analysis, using novel approaches to discover aspects of digital networks."
896608,14040,20796,Leveraging Social Connections to Improve Personalized Ranking for Collaborative Filtering,2014,"Recommending products to users means estimating their preferences for certain items over others. This can be cast either as a problem of estimating the  rating  that each user will give to each item, or as a problem of estimating users' relative preferences in the form of a  ranking . Although collaborative-filtering approaches can be used to identify users who rate and rank products similarly, another source of data that informs us about users' preferences is their set of  social connections . Both rating- and ranking-based paradigms are important in real-world recommendation settings, though rankings are especially important in settings where explicit feedback in the form of a numerical rating may not be available. Although many existing works have studied how social connections can be used to build better models for  rating  prediction, few have used social connections as a means to derive more accurate  ranking-based  models. Using social connections to better estimate users' rankings of products is the task we consider in this paper. We develop a model,  SBPR  (Social Bayesian Personalized Ranking), based on the simple observation that users tend to assign higher ranks to items that their friends prefer. We perform experiments on four real-world recommendation data sets, and show that  SBPR  outperforms alternatives in ranking prediction both in warm- and cold-start settings."
774445,14040,23735,Air-ground localization and map augmentation using monocular dense reconstruction,2013,"We propose a new method for the localization of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) with respect to a ground robot. We solve the problem of registering the 3D maps computed by the robots using different sensors: a dense 3D reconstruction from the MAV monocular camera is aligned with the map computed from the depth sensor on the ground robot. Once aligned, the dense reconstruction from the MAV is used to augment the map computed by the ground robot, by extending it with the information conveyed by the aerial views. The overall approach is novel, as it builds on recent developments in live dense reconstruction from moving cameras to address the problem of air-ground localization. The core of our contribution is constituted by a novel algorithm integrating dense reconstructions from monocular views, Monte Carlo localization, and an iterative pose refinement. In spite of the radically different vantage points from which the maps are acquired, the proposed method achieves high accuracy whereas appearance-based, state-of-the-art approaches fail. Experimental validation in indoor and outdoor scenarios reported an accuracy in position estimation of 0.08 meters and real time performance. This demonstrates that our new approach effectively overcomes the limitations imposed by the difference in sensors and vantage points that negatively affect previous techniques relying on matching visual features."
1043249,14040,20411,Collaborative factorization for recommender systems,2013,"Recommender system has become an effective tool for information filtering, which usually provides the most useful items to users by a top-k ranking list. Traditional recommendation techniques such as Nearest Neighbors (NN) and Matrix Factorization (MF) have been widely used in real recommender systems. However, neither approaches can well accomplish recommendation task since that: (1) most NN methods leverage the neighbor's behaviors for prediction, which may suffer the severe data sparsity problem; (2) MF methods are less sensitive to sparsity, but neighbors' influences on latent factors are not fully explored, since the latent factors are often used independently. To overcome the above problems, we propose a new framework for recommender systems, called collaborative factorization. It expresses the user as the combination of his own factors and those of the neighbors', called collaborative latent factors, and a ranking loss is then utilized for optimization. The advantage of our approach is that it can both enjoy the merits of NN and MF methods. In this paper, we take the logistic loss in RankNet and the likelihood loss in ListMLE as examples, and the corresponding collaborative factorization methods are called CoF-Net and CoF-MLE. Our experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that they are more effective than several state-of-the-art recommendation methods."
1301159,14040,20561,Discovery of Community Structures in a Heterogeneous Professional Online Network,2013,"Socio-technical networks that are heterogeneous in composition of actors and the media through which they interact are becoming common, but opportunities to study the emergent community structure of such networks are rare. We report a study of an international online network of educators involved in many forms of professional development and peer support, including sponsored and volunteer-driven activities taking place in both synchronous and asynchronous media, with participants from diverse career stages and occupations in education. A modularity-partitioning algorithm was applied to a directed, weighted, multimodal graph that represents associations between actors and the artifacts (chats, discussions and files) through which they interact. This analysis simultaneously detects cohesive subgroups of actors and artifacts, providing rich information about how communities are technologically embedded. Researchers deeply familiar with the network validated the interpretability of the partitions as corresponding to known activities, while also identifying new findings. The paper describes this interpretative validation, summarizes findings concerning the distribution and nature of communities and groups found within the larger heterogeneous network, and discusses open research questions and implications for practitioners."
2492006,14040,20561,Interoperability by 'Edgeware': Wireless Grids for Emergency Response,2011,"'Edgeware' for wireless grid connectivity, utilizes open specifications developed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) 'Wireless Grid Innovation Testbed' (WiGiT) to enable greater interoperability across devices, networks, applications, content and services. A wide range of new 'edgeware' applications is emerging for businesses, education, government agencies and individuals. Challenges in emergency response include interoperability, social and human factors. 'Edgeware,' a new class of software designed to share resources across people, devices, services and content has the potential capacity to solve problems of interoperability and control over resources, by the creation of wireless grids. This will allow people to access programs and data on disparate devices, across available wired and wireless networks and provide greater access to resources. Emergency services applications of wireless grids will empower citizens through their devices to contribute to their own community response. The authors describe 'Neighborhood Notification System' gridlets, now in development, which are just the first examples of use of wireless grids for emergency response. The authors conclude that police, fire, EMS, hospitals, municipal services, utilities, gas companies, media, and community residents will benefit from enhanced information sharing in emergencies based on this interoperability by 'edgeware' solution."
2259088,14040,21989,Healthcare Interoperability: CDA Documents Consolidation Using Transport Record Summary (TRS) Construction,2013,"Thanks to recent medical record standards and distributed technolo- gy, the exchange of medical documents has become readily available. Health- care institutions are able to share documents with other providers; however, patients who require medical transport are still subject to rudimentary exchange of information through verbal reports and outdated hand written medical notes. An ongoing exchange of medical documents between patient transport units and the facilities they serve would help reduce medical errors. Our approach searches for available documents that are relevant to the patients' current condi- tions based on medical coding within these documents, clinical document archi- tecture (CDA) documents, using HL7 message exchange mechanism in SOAP envelopes. These CDA documents are then consolidated into a single transport record summary (TRS) document to filter out redundancies and provide desti- nation medical service provider with the most pertinent information that is rea- dily accessible to both human and machine. In a time critical environment, access to multiple documents from difference sources is not likely feasible. For this reason, we proposes a CDA document consolidation tool, the TRS Constructor, which creates a TRS by querying and analyzing patient's multiple CDA documents. The new TRS will be registered into the Health Information Exchange (HIE) environment for cross-reference across healthcare facilities and other providers."
72152,14040,21989,Situating Asynchronous Voice in Rural Africa,2013,"Designing for oral users in economically poor places has intensified efforts to develop platforms for asynchronous voice. Often these aim to assist users in rural areas where literacy is lowest, but there are few empirical studies and design tends to be oriented by theory that contrasts the mental functions of oral and literate users, rather than by local practices in social situations. We de- scribe designing an Audio Repository (AR) based on practices, priorities and phone-use in rural Africa. The AR enables users to record, store and share voice files on a shared tablet and via their own cell-phones. We deployed the AR for 10 months in rural Africa and illiterate elders, who have few ways to use free or low-cost phone services, used it to record meetings. Use of, and interactions with, the AR informed the design of a new prototype. They also sensitized us to qualities of collective sense-making that can inspire new interactions but that guidelines for oral users overlook; such as the fusion of meaning and sound and the tuning of speech and bodily movement. Thus, we claim that situating design in local ways of saying enriches the potential for asynchronous voice."
1653332,14040,9896,Support for deictic pointing in CVEs: still fragmented after all these years',2014,"Pointing gestures -- particularly deictic references -- are ubiquitous in face-to-face communication. However, deictic pointing can be much more difficult in collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) than in everyday life -- early studies found that the 'fragmentation' caused by the environment greatly complicated object-based communication. In the fifteen years since these studies appeared, the technologies used in CVEs have improved substantially, and several techniques for improving pointing have been proposed or implemented. What these advances mean for the problems of fragmentation and deictic gesture, however, is not clear. To find out, we conducted a new observational study of deictic pointing in a CVE with several techniques that may reduce fragmentation: extra-wide and third-person views, precise control over an avatar's pointing arm, and visual enhancements such as object highlighting and laser pointing. Our study shows that although pointing has come a long way, problems of fragmentation still occur, and that visual and view enhancements can cause new problems for collaboration, even as they solve others. In addition, the visibility of a gesture's preparatory actions remained important to study participants, even when pointing was augmented. These results provide a richer understanding of the subtlety in avatar-based deictic communication, and of the ways that this critical communication mechanism can be better supported in CVEs."
1478126,14040,422,Silence is also evidence: interpreting dwell time for recommendation from psychological perspective,2013,"Social media is a platform for people to share and vote content. From the analysis of the social media data we found that users are quite inactive in rating/voting. For example, a user on average only votes 2 out of 100 accessed items. Traditional recommendation methods are mostly based on users' votes and thus can not cope with this situation. Based on the observation that the dwell time on an item may reflect the opinion of a user, we aim to enrich the user-vote matrix by converting the dwell time on items into users' ``pseudo votes'' and then help improve recommendation performance. However, it is challenging to correctly interpret the dwell time since many subjective human factors, e.g. user expectation, sensitivity to various item qualities, reading speed, are involved into the casual behavior of online reading. In psychology, it is assumed that people have choice threshold in decision making. The time spent on making decision reflects the decision maker's threshold. This idea inspires us to develop a View-Voting model, which can estimate how much the user likes the viewed item according to her dwell time, and thus make recommendations even if there is no voting data available. Finally, our experimental evaluation shows that the traditional rate-based recommendation's performance is greatly improved with the support of VV model."
1877295,14040,20561,Comparing Decision Rules for Siting Interconnected Wind Farms,2011,"The variability and non-dispatchability of wind power creates many challenges for the operators of electric transmission systems. Current U.S. wind energy policies are focused on encouraging quantities of wind power without much attention paid to quality of the power produced. Using detailed meteorological data from 113 different weather stations in Oklahoma, we simulate power production from a large number of interconnected wind farms and devise a variance-minimizing rule for successively adding farms over a wide geographic area. Our variance-minimizing rule reduces the standard deviation of five-minute averaged wind power output decreases by 27% after grouping of 8 stations. We compare our variance-minimizing decision rule with two other decision rules for incremental wind investment: a nearest-neighbor rule that has been suggested in previous literature and a profit-maximization rule that reflects decentralized decision-makers. All interconnection decision rules reduce the aggregate variance of wind power output, particularly after several stations are interconnected. We find that the nearest-neighbor rule reduces variance by less than half that of the variance-minimization rule. The profit-maximization rule achieves 75% of the variance reduction attained through the variance-minimization rule. We also evaluate and compare wind power variability over hourly and daily time scales and analyze the sensitivity of variance-minimizing wind energy investment patterns to wind-speed measurement frequency. This work is a first step in a larger project, in which we plan to compare the intermittency costs of wind power that arise from different siting policies or decision rules."
1511315,14040,20561,Fast Regulation Service Provision via Aggregation of Thermostatically Controlled Loads,2014,"Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 755 requires scheduling coordinators to procure and compensate more for regulation resources with faster ramping rates. Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs) are a tremendous demand-side resource for providing fast regulation service due to their population size and their ability of being turned ON or OFF simultaneously. In this paper, we consider modeling and control of a collection of TCLs to provide such regulation service. We first develop a non-uniform bin state transition model for aggregate modeling of a collection of TCLs. The non-uniform model presents a potential for more accurate prediction while requiring fewer number of bins (reducing the complexity of the model) than the existing uniform bin models. We also propose a randomized priority control strategy to manipulate the power consumption of TCLs to track a regulation signal, while preventing short cycling, and reducing wear and tear on the equipment. The proposed control strategy is decentralized in the sense that each TCL makes its own decision solely based on a common broadcast command signal. This framework reduces the communication and computational efforts required for implementing the control strategy. We provide illustrative simulations to show the accuracy of the developed non-uniform model and efficacy of the proposed control strategy."
1385126,14040,11317,Data-driven interaction techniques for improving navigation of educational videos,2014,"With an unprecedented scale of learners watching educational videos on online platforms such as MOOCs and YouTube, there is an opportunity to incorporate data generated from their interactions into the design of novel video interaction techniques. Interaction data has the potential to help not only instructors to improve their videos, but also to enrich the learning experience of educational video watchers. This paper explores the design space of data-driven interaction techniques for educational video navigation. We introduce a set of techniques that augment existing video interface widgets, including: a 2D video timeline with an embedded visualization of collective navigation traces; dynamic and non-linear timeline scrubbing; data-enhanced transcript search and keyword summary; automatic display of relevant still frames next to the video; and a visual summary representing points with high learner activity. To evaluate the feasibility of the techniques, we ran a laboratory user study with simulated learning tasks. Participants rated watching lecture videos with interaction data to be efficient and useful in completing the tasks. However, no significant differences were found in task performance, suggesting that interaction data may not always align with moment-by-moment information needs during the tasks."
856177,14040,20561,Disentangling the Value of Information and Analytics through Componentized Business Architecture,2012,"Data has been a key resource in the operation of enterprises for quite some time. Information technology practices have been created to manage data from a variety of perspectives. The growth of data sources and the need to obtain more value from huge volumes have paved the advent of business analytics. Expectations from business managers and executives have risen accordingly. Today, the need to align the value of information and analytics to the resource-base of an organization has become the 'new normal'. Realizing this potential calls for new practices, i.e., IT-centric data management activities need to be complemented with business-centric practices that help understand raw and analytical information entities and their value to operations and strategy. This paper presents models and techniques to help assess the value of information and analytics at the realm of the asset base of organizations. The approach is based on models of business operations and the way information (raw and analytical) is connected to the organization and its business priorities. This linkage builds upon the notions of componentized business architecture, simplified information metamodel and basic relationship between the two concepts. A real-world case study in the insurance industry with the corresponding business architecture frameworks and information models illustrates the practical value of the approach."
1188931,14040,20796,Community-based user recommendation in uni-directional social networks,2013,"Advances in Web 2.0 technology has led to the rising popularity of many social network services. For example, there are over 500 million active users in Twitter. Given the huge number of users, user recommendation has gained importance where the goal is to find a set of users whom a target user is likely to follow. Content-based approaches that rely on tweet content for user recommendation have low precision as tweet contents are typically short and noisy, while collaborative filtering approaches that utilize follower-followee relationships lead to higher precision but data sparsity remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a community-based approach to user recommendation in Twitter-style social networks. Forming communities enables us to reduce data sparsity as the focus is on discover the latent characteristics of communities instead of individuals. We employ an LDA-based method on the follower-followee relationships to discover communities before applying the state-of-the-art matrix factorization method on each of the communities. This approach proves effective in improving the conversion rate (by as much as 20%) as demonstrated by the results of extensive experiments on two real world data sets Twitter and Weibo. In addition, the community-based approach is scalable as the individual community can be analyzed separately."
1212860,14040,11317,SenSkin: adapting skin as a soft interface,2013,"We present a sensing technology and input method that uses skin deformation estimated through a thin band-type device attached to the human body, the appearance of which seems socially acceptable in daily life. An input interface usually requires feedback. SenSkin provides tactile feedback that enables users to know which part of the skin they are touching in order to issue commands. The user, having found an acceptable area before beginning the input operation, can continue to input commands without receiving explicit feedback. We developed an experimental device with two armbands to sense three-dimensional pressure applied to the skin. Sensing tangential force on uncovered skin without haptic obstacles has not previously been achieved. SenSkin is also novel in that quantitative tangential force applied to the skin, such as that of the forearm or fingers, is measured. An infrared (IR) reflective sensor is used since its durability and inexpensiveness make it suitable for everyday human sensing purposes. The multiple sensors located on the two armbands allow the tangential and normal force applied to the skin dimension to be sensed. The input command is learned and recognized using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Finally, we show an application in which this input method is implemented."
2423300,14040,20358,SoCo: a social network aided context-aware recommender system,2013,"Contexts and social network information have been proven to be valuable information for building accurate recommender system. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing works systematically combine diverse types of such information to further improve recommendation quality. In this paper, we propose SoCo, a novel context-aware recommender system incorporating elaborately processed social network information. We handle contextual information by applying random decision trees to partition the original user-item-rating matrix such that the ratings with similar contexts are grouped. Matrix factorization is then employed to predict missing preference of a user for an item using the partitioned matrix. In order to incorporate social network information, we introduce an additional social regularization term to the matrix factorization objective function to infer a user's preference for an item by learning opinions from his/her friends who are expected to share similar tastes. A context-aware version of Pearson Correlation Coefficient is proposed to measure user similarity. Real datasets based experiments show that SoCo improves the performance (in terms of root mean square error) of the state-of-the-art context-aware recommender system and social recommendation model by 15.7% and 12.2% respectively."
1302513,14040,10237,My head is your tail: applying link analysis on long-tailed music listening behavior for music recommendation,2011,"Collaborative filtering, being a popular method for generating recommendations, produces satisfying results for users by providing extremely relevant items. Despite being popular, however, this method is prone to many problems. One of these problems is popularity bias, in which the system becomes skewed towards items that are popular amongst the general user population. These 'obvious' items are, technically, extremely relevant items but fail to be novel. In this paper, we maintain using collaborative filtering methods while still managing to produce novel yet relevant items. This is achieved by utilizing the long-tailed distribution of listening behavior of users, in which their playlists are biased towards a few songs while the rest of the songs, those in the long tail, have relatively low play counts. In addition, we also apply a link analysis method to users and define links between them to create an increasingly fine-grained approach in calculating weights for the recommended items. The proposed recommendation method was available online as a user study in order to measure the relevancy and novelty of the recommended items. Results show that the algorithm manages to include novel recommendations that are still relevant, and shows the potential for a new way of generating novel recommendations."
1844959,14040,20561,Antecedents and Outcomes of Boundary Objects in Knowledge Interaction in the Context of Software Systems Analysis,2011,"Much of knowledge management research has focused on knowledge generation, translation and storage during interactions among knowledge workers, which has led to project success; however, less effort has been made to examine the effects of artifacts or boundary objects that such interactions yield. Thus, the study aimed to help fill this research gap by investigating, not only the categories and characteristics of boundary objects, but also the possible antecedents, taking into consideration the link between outcome and type of boundary object. In the information system field, system design and implementation is a continuous process of interactions between system analysts and end-users, with most interactions occurring in the stage of defining system requirements. Thus, this stage offers an appropriate context to study knowledge interaction. Based on data collected and codified from 82 records of knowledge interaction, the results showed that project performance could be highly enhanced by making use of syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and metaphoric boundary objects. In addition, higher atmosphere leads to a higher frequency of the occurrence of semantic boundary objects. Although the results may be inevitably linked to the context being investigated, the importance of the expected findings will trigger like studies in other contexts."
979216,14040,10237,Generalizing matrix factorization through flexible regression priors,2011,"Predicting user ratings on items is a crucial task in recommender systems. Matrix factorization methods that computes a low-rank approximation of the incomplete user-item rating matrix provide state-of-the-art performance, especially for users and items with several past ratings (warm starts). However, it is a challenge to generalize such methods to users and items with few or no past ratings (cold starts). Prior work [4][32] have generalized matrix factorization to include both user and item features for performing better regularization of factors as well as provide a model for smooth transition from cold starts to warm starts. However, the features were incorporated via linear regression on factor estimates. In this paper, we generalize this process to allow for arbitrary regression models like decision trees, boosting, LASSO, etc. The key advantage of our approach is the ease of computing --- any new regression procedure can be incorporated by plugging in a standard regression routine into a few intermediate steps of our model fitting procedure. With this flexibility, one can leverage a large body of work on regression modeling, variable selection, and model interpretation. We demonstrate the usefulness of this generalization using the MovieLens and Yahoo! Buzz datasets."
2074109,14040,20796,Learning to rank audience for behavioral targeting in display ads,2011,"Behavioral targeting (BT), which aims to sell advertisers those behaviorally related user segments to deliver their advertisements, is facing a bottleneck in serving the rapid growth of long tail advertisers. Due to the small business nature of the tail advertisers, they generally expect to accurately reach a small group of audience, which is hard to be satisfied by classical BT solutions with large size user segments. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic generative model named Rank Latent Dirichlet Allocation (RANKLDA) to rank audience according to their ads click probabilities for the long tail advertisers to deliver their ads. Based on the basic assumption that users who clicked the same group of ads will have a higher probability of sharing similar latent search topical interests, RANKLDA combines topic discovery from users' search behaviors and learning to rank users from their ads click behaviors together. In computation, the topic learning could be enhanced by the supervised information of the rank learning and simultaneously, the rank learning could be better optimized by considering the discovered topics as features. This co-optimization scheme enhances each other iteratively. Experiments over the real click-through log of display ads in a public ad network show that the proposed RANKLDA model can effectively rank the audience for the tail advertisers."
1950385,14040,20561,Reliability Assessment at Day-Ahead Operating Stage in Power Systems with Wind Generation,2013,"This paper proposes to evaluate reliability performances at operating stage for power systems with variable wind generation. This is a first step towards recognizing the stronger coupling of power system decision making across different timescales. In the day-ahead energy-reserve co-optimization unit commitment model, the validity of using operating reserve as an approximation of long-term reliability requirement is tested with realistic wind generation profile. Reliability indices such as Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) and Loss of Expected Energy (LOEE) are computed at each hour of the day at the conclusion of the day-ahead unit commitment decision. Numerical experiments conducted in the IEEE Reliability Test System suggest that while operating reserve requirement does not change within a day, the actual reliability performance of the system varies significantly depending on (i) system loading conditions , (ii) wind power variation, and (iii) operating rules. Also, the operating reserve requirement is shown to either over-approximate or under-approximate the reliability requirement of power system. It indicates that operating reserve could be a very coarse deterministic approximation of system reliability requirement especially with high wind penetration. A much more integrated approach for modeling, analysis, and decision making is envisaged for provision of reliable and cost-effective electricity services."
1147621,14040,422,GeoMF: joint geographical modeling and matrix factorization for point-of-interest recommendation,2014,"Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important means to help people discover attractive locations. However, extreme sparsity of user-POI matrices creates a severe challenge. To cope with this challenge, viewing mobility records on location-based social networks (LBSNs) as implicit feedback for POI recommendation, we first propose to exploit weighted matrix factorization for this task since it usually serves collaborative filtering with implicit feedback better. Besides, researchers have recently discovered a spatial clustering phenomenon in human mobility behavior on the LBSNs, i.e., individual visiting locations tend to cluster together, and also demonstrated its effectiveness in POI recommendation, thus we incorporate it into the factorization model. Particularly, we augment users' and POIs' latent factors in the factorization model with activity area vectors of users and influence area vectors of POIs, respectively. Based on such an augmented model, we not only capture the spatial clustering phenomenon in terms of two-dimensional kernel density estimation, but we also explain why the introduction of such a phenomenon into matrix factorization helps to deal with the challenge from matrix sparsity. We then evaluate the proposed algorithm on a large-scale LBSN dataset. The results indicate that weighted matrix factorization is superior to other forms of factorization models and that incorporating the spatial clustering phenomenon into matrix factorization improves recommendation performance."
2396799,14040,10237,Exploiting temporal influence in online recommendation,2014,"In this paper we give methods for time-aware music recommendation in a social media service with the potential of exploiting immediate temporal influences between users. We consider events when a user listens to an artist the first time and this event follows some friend listening to the same artist short time before. We train a blend of matrix factorization methods that model the relation of the influencer, the influenced and the artist, both the individual factor decompositions and their weight learned by variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Special care is taken since events of influence form a subset of the positive implicit feedback data and hence we have to cope with two different definitions of the positive and negative implicit training data. In addition, in the time-aware setting we have to use online learning  and  evaluation methods. While SGD can easily be trained online, evaluation is cumbersome by traditional measures since we will have potentially different top recommendations at different times. Our experiments are carried over the two-year scrobble history of 70,000 Last.fm users and show a 5% increase in recommendation quality by predicting temporal influences."
1497839,14040,20561,Cost Allocation in Ancillary Service Markets,2014,"Market designs for reserve capacity in power systems face new challenges in terms of demand side participation (DSP) and renewable energy in-feed. In order to enhance power system flexibility and to reduce the amounts required of reserve capacity two key issues have to be tackled: First, financial incentives for DSP to participate in Ancillary Service markets. Second, incentives for intermittent sources and demand to adhere to their forecasted in-feed schedule. Therefore, we consider the public good aspect of reliable electricity supply and treat deviations from the schedule in in-feed or consumption as negative externalities in electricity market operation. Our contributions are twofold: First, we present a novel methodology which incorporates the individual evaluation of reserves via a suitable cost allocation framework and therefore enhances DSP to ensure operational security. Second, we provide a framework to establish market based adaptive in-feed premiums for renewable energy sources and to assess investments in DSP and distributed storage in order to reduce the amount of reserve capacity procured by the System Operator. A simulation study shows that our approach leads to a Pareto-efficient reduction in the amount of procured reserves and hence social costs."
978828,14040,9896,Interactional Order and Constructed Ways of Seeing with Touchless Imaging Systems in Surgery,2014,"While surgical practices are increasingly reliant on a range of digital imaging technologies, the ability for clinicians to interact and manipulate these digital representations in the operating theatre using traditional touch based interaction devices is constrained by the need to maintain sterility. To overcome these concerns with sterility, a number of researchers are have been developing ways of enabling interaction in the operating theatre using touchless interaction techniques such as gesture and voice to allow clinicians control of the systems. While there have been important technical strides in the area, there has been little in the way of understanding the use of these touchless systems in practice. With this in mind we present a touchless system developed for use during vascular surgery. We deployed the system in the endovascular suite of a large hospital for use in the context of real procedures. We present findings from a study of the system in use focusing on how, with touchless interaction, the visual resources were embedded and made meaningful in the collaborative practices of surgery. In particular we discuss the importance of direct and dynamic control of the images by the clinicians in the context of talk and in the context of other artefact use as well as the work performed by members of the clinical team to make themselves sensable by the system. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for how we think about the design, evaluation and use of these systems."
803114,14040,20561,"Transportation Performances Measures and Metrics: Overall Transportation Effectiveness (OTE): A Framework, Prototype and Case Study",2013,"Transportation is essential to global economy. Nevertheless, Logistic Service Provisioning (LSP) is an industry with typically low margins. Competition is fierce and processes often inefficient, one example being a high percentage of empty miles (for trucks) resulting in unnecessary costs. Collaboration and better information exchange between LSPs and their supply chain partners are perceived to be essential in reducing empty miles. As a basis for collaboration initiatives, it is important to identify how LSPs currently perform. There is an urgent need for performance measurement. Business Intelligence (BI) matured over recent years and provides methods and tools for the construction of performance measurement dashboards. Still, LSPs struggle to identify accurate and effective performance indicators and face difficulties to implement these in a BI dashboard. To address this problem, we follow a design science approach to develop an Overall Transportation Effectiveness (OTE) framework using an extensive literature analysis and an analysis of current performance measurement practices. The OTE framework is implemented in a BI dashboard, which we piloted and evaluate in the Dutch branch of one of Europe's largest LSPs. The paper concludes with a discussion of our findings and an outlook on potential future work."

Enterprises are aware that to derive real business value from Big Data and seek competitive advantages, they need to have available the right tool to extract, capture and organize a wide variety of useful data and insights from different sources, and to be able to easily use and analyze it within the context of their data. In this paper we present Big Graph, a solution for enterprises to manage Big Data and facilitate data integration, making the enterprise data more accessible and easier to use externally. Big Graph provides the technology and expertise to build a data-centric enterprise architecture by enabling intuitive navigation, knowledge discovery, extensibility and social analysis. It offers 'social' capabilities that enable unified communications and collaborations to help enterprises to reduce the time and cost needed to analyze critical information and efficiently improve enterprise productivity. It is believed that Big Graph is a suitable tool capable of facilitating enterprises to create and link their data as a graph allowing information flow around their world and outside."
768121,14040,20411,Preference preserving hashing for efficient recommendation,2014,"Recommender systems usually need to compare a large number of items before users' most preferred ones can be found This process can be very costly if recommendations are frequently made on large scale datasets. In this paper, a novel hashing algorithm, named Preference Preserving Hashing (PPH), is proposed to speed up recommendation. Hashing has been widely utilized in large scale similarity search (e.g. similar image search), and the search speed with binary hashing code is significantly faster than that with real-valued features. However, one challenge of applying hashing to recommendation is that, recommendation concerns users' preferences over items rather than their similarities. To address this challenge, PPH contains two novel components that work with the popular matrix factorization (MF) algorithm. In MF, users' preferences over items are calculated as the inner product between the learned real-valued user/item features. The first component of PPH constrains the learning process, so that users' preferences can be well approximated by user-item similarities. The second component, which is a novel quantization algorithm,generates the binary hashing code from the learned real-valued user/item features. Finally, recommendation can be achieved efficiently via fast hashing code search. Experiments on three real world datasets show that the recommendation speed of the proposed PPH algorithm can be hundreds of times faster than original MF with real-valued features, and the recommendation accuracy is significantly better than previous work of hashing for recommendation."
1925879,14040,20561,A Balanced Scorecard Approach to Perioperative Process Management: A Case Study Perspective,2013,"This study examines business process management practices of balanced scorecard and dashboard applications to monitor, measure, and improve a hospital's perioperative process at strategic, tactical, and day-to-day operations levels. This paper identifies how dynamic technological activities of analysis, evaluation, and synthesis applied to internal and external organizational data can highlight complex relationships within integrated hospital processes to target opportunities for improvement and ultimately yield improved process capabilities. The identification of existing limitations, potential capabilities, and the subsequent contextual understanding are contributing factors that yield measured improvement within a hospital's perioperative process. Based on a 90-month longitudinal study of a large 909 registered-bed teaching hospital, this case study investigates the impact of integrated information systems to identify, qualify, and quantify business analytics used to improve perioperative efficiency and effectiveness across patient quality of care, operational efficiency, and financial cost effectiveness. The theoretical and practical implications and/or limitations of this study's results are also discussed with respect to practitioners and researchers alike."
1808441,14040,11317,NaviRadar: a novel tactile information display for pedestrian navigation,2011,"We introduce NaviRadar: an interaction technique for mobile phones that uses a radar metaphor in order to communicate the user's correct direction for crossings along a desired route. A radar sweep rotates clockwise and tactile feedback is provided where each sweep distinctly conveys the user's current direction and the direction in which the user must travel. In a first study, we evaluated the overall concept and tested five different tactile patterns to communicate the two different directions via a single tactor. The results show that people are able to easily understand the NaviRadar concept and can identify the correct direction with a mean deviation of 37° out of the full 360° provided. A second study shows that NaviRadar achieves similar results in terms of perceived usability and navigation performance when compared with spoken instructions. By using only tactile feedback, NaviRadar provides distinct advantages over current systems. In particular, no visual attention is required to navigate; thus, it can be spent on providing greater awareness of one's surroundings. Moreover, the lack of audio attention enables it to be used in noisy environments or this attention can be better spent on talking with others during navigation."
2587255,14040,22113,Interfacing virtual agents with collaborative knowledge: open domain question answering using wikipedia-based topic models,2011,"This paper is concerned with the use of conversational agents as an interaction paradigm for accessing open domain encyclopedic knowledge by means of Wikipedia. More precisely, we describe a dialog-based question answering system for German which utilizes Wikipedia-based topic models as a reference point for context detection and answer prediction. We investigate two different perspectives to the task of interfacing virtual agents with collaborative knowledge. First, we exploit the use of Wikipedia categories as a basis for identifying the broader topic of a spoken utterance. Second, we describe how to enhance the conversational behavior of the virtual agent by means of a Wikipedia-based question answering component which incorporates the question topic. At large, our approach identifies topic-related focus terms of a user's question, which are subsequently mapped onto a category taxonomy. Thus, we utilize the taxonomy as a reference point to derive topic labels for a user's question. The employed topic model is thereby based on explicitly given concepts as represented by the document and category structure of the Wikipedia knowledge base. Identified topic categories are subsequently combined with different linguistic filtering methods to improve answer candidate retrieval and reranking. Results show that the topic model approach contributes to an enhancement of the conversational behavior of virtual agents."
1986834,14040,20561,Predicting the Risk of Low Back Disorders due to Manual Handling Tasks,2012,"Work related low back disorders (LBDs) due to manual material handling (MMH) tasks have long been recognized as one of the main occupational disabling injury that affects the quality of life of the industrial working population in the U.S. One of the efforts to comprehend the nature and phenomenon of LBDs due to MMH tasks was undertaken by Marras [18]. Based on multiple experiments they created a seminal data set and used it to build logistic regression models to identify significant variables and classify manual lifting tasks into high risk and low risk with respect to LBDs. Since then a number of studies have used the same data set to build and test various classification models. This paper analyzes the previous studies and employs the same data set to build and test seven classification methods. Though the performances of our best models are better than those reported in National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOHS) Guides and two of our previous studies, they are generally less optimistic than those reported in several other studies, this paper proposes a more systematic and reliable approach to creating and validating classifiers to distinguish between low and high risk manual lifting jobs that contribute to LBDs."
629428,14040,20332,Discovering spammers in social networks,2012,"As the popularity of the social media increases, as evidenced in Twitter, Facebook and China's Renren, spamming activities also picked up in numbers and variety. On social network sites, spammers often disguise themselves by creating fake accounts and hijacking normal users' accounts for personal gains. Different from the spammers in traditional systems such as SMS and email, spammers in social media behave like normal users and they continue to change their spamming strategies to fool anti-spamming systems. However, due to the privacy and resource concerns, many social media websites cannot fully monitor all the contents of users, making many of the previous approaches, such as topology-based and content-classification-based methods, infeasible to use. In this paper, we propose a Supervised Matrix Factorization method with Social Regularization (SMFSR) for spammer detection in social networks that exploits both social activities as well as users' social relations in an innovative and highly scalable manner. The proposed method detects spammers collectively based on users' social actions and social relations. We have empirically tested our method on data from Renren.com, which is one of the largest social networks in China, and demonstrated that our new method can improve the detection performance significantly."
1389325,14040,20561,Do Competitive Environments Have an Effect on Managerial Decision Making? An Empirical Investigation of the Newsvendor Problem,2014,"Our research aims to extend the literature by empirically investigating a few critical aspects of the Newsvendor decision making problem that have not been studied before. First, we look at the impact of playing the game in a competitive (tournament) environment, where all subjects in the room are ranked by their profits after each round. We also study the impact of incrementally adding decision support information on the outcome biases of the tournament participants. Finally, we investigate gender differences in decision making in the tournament newsvendor decision-making game. Our results show that displaying the best performance results per round (beyond telling each subject his own performance ranking) can increase the subjects' performance in terms of order quantities. We find that when we display the best performance results after each round in the competitive environment, subjects reduce their pull to the center bias, and gravitate toward the optimal order quantities in both high and low profit conditions as indirect decision support information is provided. We also observe that showing additional direct cues (such as the realized fill rate per round, or even plots of the expected profit as a function of the order size) has a negative effect on order quantity in the high profit condition, but helps participants in the low profit case after controlling for the learning-by-doing effect. Significant gender differences are only observed in the high competitive environment."
833220,14040,9896,Institutional logics of the EMR and the problem of 'perfect' but inaccurate accounts,2014,"Electronic Medical Records promise to simultaneously enhance coordination and provide transparency and accountability in work process. As such, EMR are purported to benefit both hospitals and patients. In this paper we use grounded empirical data to explore how this promise plays out in the everyday tasks of healthcare providers. Building on the small body of CSCW literature that suggests that the accounting functions of EMR are impinging on the ability of medical personnel to coordinate work, we draw on the theoretical lens of new institutionalism to outline how certain institutional logics around safety and accountability are shaping the experience of EMR systems in situ. We suggest that the institutional logics that currently characterize U.S. healthcare are embedded in the EMR design itself, structuring how institutional values such as 'safety' are achieved and evaluated. Using over one year of ethnographic research in an obstetrical unit, we find that the institutional logics of 'safety' embedded in the EMR create negative organizational outcomes, effectively undermining coordination and necessitating inaccurate accounts of work. We provide design implications to address these issues in the current institutional environment and envision how systems might be designed to promote alternate logics of safety that are social, dynamic, and cast humans as expert agents in the system."
1240723,14040,20561,Phasor Measurement Unit Placement for Identifying Power Line Outages in Wide-Area Transmission System Monitoring,2014,"Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are widely recognized to be instrumental for enhancing the power system situational awareness - a key step toward the future power grid. With limited PMU resources and high installation costs, it is of great importance to develop strategic PMU deployment methods. This paper focuses on optimally selecting PMU locations for monitoring transmission line status across the wide-area grid. To bypass the combinatorial search involved, a linear programming reformulation is first developed to provide an upper bound estimate for the global optimum. Furthermore, a greedy heuristic method is adopted with the complexity only linearly in the number of PMUs, while leveraging on the upper bound estimate a branch-and-bound algorithm is also developed to achieve a near-optimal performance at a reduced complexity. Numerical tests on various IEEE test cases demonstrate the validity of our proposed methods, greatly advocating the satisfactory performance the simple greedy method at only linear complexity. This suggests a hybrid method by using the greedy solution as a warm start to reduce the number of BB iterations."
1308766,14040,9896,A social crowd-controlled orchestra,2013,"We present a novel social interactive system that brings music creation to the crowds. It allows anyone with a personal electronic device and regardless of their musical expertise to participate in the music an orchestra generates, while also encouraging social interactions among participants. Users can be either musicians or conductors. The latter drive the group's music production, while the others follow simple game-like instructions on their device for playing the conductor's selected songs. The primary mode of interaction for playing songs, consists of rotating one's electronic device in different ways. Our system also provides different social interaction cues that aim for novice and expert users to start conversations with each other and improve the group's performance as well as construct a community among participants. We report on a qualitative analysis, which suggests that users appreciate the system's versatility in providing service to a variety of devices and enjoy participating in the orchestra with their own personal device. Users judged the social interaction cues the system provided to be effective. We believe our findings aid the design of future social intelligent environments that seek to build communities with participants through music."
781546,14040,20358,Recommending investors for crowdfunding projects,2014,"To bring their innovative ideas to market, those embarking in new ventures have to raise money, and, to do so, they have often resorted to banks and venture capitalists. Nowadays, they have an additional option: that of crowdfunding. The name refers to the idea that funds come from a network of people on the Internet who are passionate about supporting others' projects. One of the most popular crowdfunding sites is Kickstarter. In it, creators post descriptions of their projects and advertise them on social media sites (mainly Twitter), while investors look for projects to support. The most common reason for project failure is the inability of founders to connect with a sufficient number of investors, and that is mainly because hitherto there has not been any automatic way of matching creators and investors. We thus set out to propose different ways of recommending investors found on Twitter for specific Kickstarter projects. We do so by conducting hypothesis-driven analyses of pledging behavior and translate the corresponding findings into different recommendation strategies. The best strategy achieves, on average, 84% of accuracy in predicting a list of potential investors' Twitter accounts for any given project. Our findings also produced key insights about the whys and wherefores of investors deciding to support innovative efforts."
2067445,14040,21989,Exploring Initiative Interactions on a Proxemic and Ambient Public Screen,2014,"Public screens are common in modern society, and provide information services to audiences. However, as more and more screens are installed, it becomes a burden for users to find information concerning themselves quickly. This is because screens cannot understand what users really need, they only display pre-designed information related to a certain location. To ensure better cohabitation between people and screens, one solution is to make screens understand users rather than make users understand screens. Given that it is difficult, even for humans, to interpret other people's intentions, it is far harder for screens to understand users. We need first to decide which kinds of information about users could be helpful for a screen to estimate to users' needs. In this paper, we study a public interactive screen, which can speculate as to users' intentions by interpreting their proxemic attributes (such as dis- tance, movement, etc.) and context information (identity, locations, etc.). Based on proxemic interaction semantics, we built an interactive pub- lic screen, which: 1) could interpret users' needs in advance and display relevant information; 2) be available for multi-users and display distinct information to them; 3) be open for data exchanges with users' mobile devices. Through a lab study, we demonstrate that the screen presented in this paper is more attractive to users and could provide users with useful information more rapidly and precisely than traditional screens."
1730671,14040,20796,Graph-based Point-of-interest Recommendation with Geographical and Temporal Influences,2014,"The availability of user check-in data in large volume from the rapid growing location-based social networks (LBSNs) enables a number of important location-aware services. Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of such services, which is to recommend POIs that users have not visited before. It has been observed that: (i) users tend to visit nearby places, and (ii) users tend to visit different places in different time slots, and in the same time slot, users tend to periodically visit the same places. For example, users usually visit a restaurant during lunch hours, and visit a pub at night. In this paper, we focus on the problem of  time-aware POI recommendation , which aims at recommending a list of POIs for a user to visit at a given time. To exploit both  geographical and temporal influences  in time aware POI recommendation, we propose the Geographical-Temporal influences Aware Graph (GTAG) to model check-in records, geographical influence and temporal influence. For effective and efficient recommendation based on GTAG, we develop a preference propagation algorithm named  Breadth first Preference Propagation  (BPP). The algorithm follows a relaxed breath-first search strategy, and returns recommendation results within at most 6 propagation steps. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the proposed graph-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art POI recommendation methods substantially."
2122719,14040,23836,An Effective Self-adaptive Load Balancing Algorithm for Peer-to-Peer Networks,2012,"The field of parallel and distributed computing has become increasingly significant as recent advances in electronic and integrated circuit technologies. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud computing networks are the largest contributor of network traffic on the Internet. Measurement plays an important role in different P2P applications, we should enhance the measurement-based optimization of P2P networking and applications. In especial, to enhance the file sharing efficiency in P2P networks while reducing the inter-domain traffic, extensive schemes are proposed and file sharing is becoming seriously concerned. However, difference in ability, free-riding behavior and high churn have caused great unbalance on load degree between high speed network nodes. This paper presents a self-adaptive load balancing algorithm, where nodes create binary tree back-up node tables for their shared hot files automatically, and transfer extra query quest connection sent originally to heavy-load nodes and to back-up nodes. The experimental results reveal our algorithm can reduce load degree of heavy-load nodes and bring ideal balance between high speed network nodes, although under high churn, it also has balance effect and lower load degree of the whole network systems."
1585748,14040,9713,LORE: exploiting sequential influence for location recommendations,2014,"Providing location recommendations becomes an important feature for location-based social networks (LBSNs), since it helps users explore new places and makes LBSNs more prevalent to users. In LBSNs,  geographical influence  and  social influence  have been intensively used in location recommendations based on the facts that geographical proximity of locations significantly affects users' check-in behaviors and social friends often have common interests. Although human movement exhibits sequential patterns, most current studies on location recommendations do not consider any  sequential influence  of locations on users' check-in behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new approach called LORE to exploit sequential influence on location recommendations. First, LORE incrementally mines sequential patterns from location sequences and represents the sequential patterns as a  dynamic Location-Location Transition Graph  (L 2 TG). LORE then predicts the probability of a user visiting a location by  Additive Markov Chain  (AMC) with L 2 TG. Finally, LORE fuses  sequential influence  with  geographical influence  and  social influence  into a unified recommendation framework; in particular the geographical influence is modeled as  two-dimensional check-in probability distributions  rather than  one-dimensional distance probability distributions  in existing works. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for LORE using two large-scale real data sets collected from Foursquare and Gowalla. Experimental results show that LORE achieves significantly superior location recommendations compared to other state-of-the-art recommendation techniques."
1346380,14040,11166,Exploring Social Influence on Location-Based Social Networks,2014,"Recently, with the advent of location-based social networking services (LBSNs), travel planning and location-aware information recommendation based on LBSNs have attracted much research attention. In this paper, we study the impact of social relations hidden in LBSNs, i.e., The social influence of friends. We propose a new social influence-based user recommender framework (SIR) to discover the potential value from reliable users (i.e., Close friends and travel experts). Explicitly, our SIR framework is able to infer influential users from an LBSN. We claim to capture the interactions among virtual communities, physical mobility activities and time effects to infer the social influence between user pairs. Furthermore, we intend to model the propagation of influence using diffusion-based mechanism. Moreover, we have designed a dynamic fusion framework to integrate the features mined into a united follow probability score. Finally, our SIR framework provides personalized top-k user recommendations for individuals. To evaluate the recommendation results, we have conducted extensive experiments on real datasets (i.e., The Go Walla dataset). The experimental results show that the performance of our SIR framework is better than the state-of the-art user recommendation mechanisms in terms of accuracy and reliability."
1808813,14040,8927,Learning multiple-question decision trees for cold-start recommendation,2013,"For cold-start recommendation, it is important to rapidly profile new users and generate a good initial set of recommendations through an interview process --- users should be queried adaptively in a sequential fashion, and multiple items should be offered for opinion solicitation at each trial. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that learns to conduct the interview process guided by a decision tree with multiple questions at each split. The splits, represented as sparse weight vectors, are learned through an L_1-constrained optimization framework. The users are directed to child nodes according to the inner product of their responses and the corresponding weight vector. More importantly, to account for the variety of responses coming to a node, a linear regressor is learned within each node using all the previously obtained answers as input to predict item ratings. A user study, preliminary but first in its kind in cold-start recommendation, is conducted to explore the efficient number and format of questions being asked in a recommendation survey to minimize user cognitive efforts. Quantitative experimental validations also show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both the prediction accuracy and user cognitive efforts."
1737369,14040,9896,Turning Conflicts into Collaboration,2013,"In model-driven software development, software models are the main artifacts used not only for supporting brainstorming, analysis, and design purposes, but also for generating executable code. Such software models are usually not created by one single developer, but within a team. To coordinate team work, versioning systems have proven to be indispensable for managing modifications performed by different modelers at the same time. When concurrently performed modifications are contradicting each other, the standard versioning paradigm requires the person who detected the conflict to resolve it immediately in order to keep the evolved artifacts in a consistent state. Whereas this approach works well in later phases of the software development process, in early phases, when the development team had not established a consolidated view on the system under development yet, the conflicts might provide valuable information on the various intentions of the modelers. This information might be lost if removed in an undocumented manner by a single modeler. We propose an alternative versioning paradigm for models, where conflicts are temporarily tolerated and discuss its technical realization for current modeling languages such as the UML. The resolution of conflicts is then not performed by one single modeler but within a team so that a consolidated version of the model is obtained."
2200343,14040,422,HySAD: a semi-supervised hybrid shilling attack detector for trustworthy product recommendation,2012,"Shilling attackers apply biased rating profiles to recommender systems for manipulating online product recommendations. Although many studies have been devoted to shilling attack detection, few of them can handle the  hybrid  shilling attacks that usually happen in practice, and the studies for real-life applications are rarely seen. Moreover, little attention has yet been paid to modeling both labeled and unlabeled user profiles, although there are often a few labeled but numerous unlabeled users available in practice. This paper presents a Hybrid Shilling Attack Detector, or HySAD for short, to tackle these problems. In particular, HySAD introduces MC-Relief to select effective detection metrics, and Semi-supervised Naive Bayes (SNB_lambda) to precisely separate Random-Filler model attackers and Average-Filler model attackers from normal users. Thorough experiments on MovieLens and Netflix datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HySAD in detecting hybrid shilling attacks, and its robustness for various obfuscated strategies. A real-life case study on product reviews of Amazon.cn is also provided, which further demonstrates that HySAD can effectively improve the accuracy of a collaborative-filtering based recommender system, and provide interesting opportunities for in-depth analysis of attacker behaviors. These, in turn, justify the value of HySAD for real-world applications."
1847059,14040,11317,Digits: freehand 3D interactions anywhere using a wrist-worn gloveless sensor,2012,"Digits is a wrist-worn sensor that recovers the full 3D pose of the user's hand. This enables a variety of freehand interactions on the move. The system targets mobile settings, and is specifically designed to be low-power and easily reproducible using only off-the-shelf hardware. The electronics are self-contained on the user's wrist, but optically image the entirety of the user's hand. This data is processed using a new pipeline that robustly samples key parts of the hand, such as the tips and lower regions of each finger. These sparse samples are fed into new kinematic models that leverage the biomechanical constraints of the hand to recover the 3D pose of the user's hand. The proposed system works without the need for full instrumentation of the hand (for example using data gloves), additional sensors in the environment, or depth cameras which are currently prohibitive for mobile scenarios due to power and form-factor considerations. We demonstrate the utility of Digits for a variety of application scenarios, including 3D spatial interaction with mobile devices, eyes-free interaction on-the-move, and gaming. We conclude with a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our system, and discussion of strengths, limitations and future work."
1175805,14040,9896,'On the ground' in Sidi Bouzid: investigating social media use during the tunisian revolution,2013,"We present a study conducted in Sidi Bouzid, the Tunisian town where the Arab Revolution, also known as 'Arab Spring', started, and where the role of Web 2.0 and social media applications in the people's uprising have been much discussed. We identify four relevant phenomena: (1) the publication of classified materials via WikiLeaks challenged the regime's legitimacy, (2) Web 2.0 connected local activists with Arab satellite TV, (3) social media linked the young activists with actors in other cities in Tunisia, (4) social media allowed organizing resistance inside Sidi Bouzid. Methodologically, we question a too deterministic view of the role of the new media and the representativeness of investigative techniques that uniquely use the new media in order to assess their impact. At the same time, rigorous investigations 'on the ground' are extremely difficult. We present a modest and initial attempt to provide such an 'on the ground' approach, cognizant of necessary limitations. We compare our findings with studies which analyze data downloaded out of social media applications and suggest that studies of the kind we describe offer additional insight and play an essential role in better understanding political uses of social media."
2256511,14040,11317,Interactive record/replay for web application debugging,2013,"During debugging, a developer must repeatedly and manually reproduce faulty behavior in order to inspect different facets of the program's execution. Existing tools for reproducing such behaviors prevent the use of debugging aids such as breakpoints and logging, and are not designed for interactive, random-access exploration of recorded behavior. This paper presents Timelapse, a tool for quickly recording, reproducing, and debugging interactive behaviors in web applications. Developers can use Timelapse to browse, visualize, and seek within recorded program executions while simultaneously using familiar debugging tools such as breakpoints and logging. Testers and end-users can use Timelapse to demonstrate failures in situ and share recorded behaviors with developers, improving bug report quality by obviating the need for detailed reproduction steps. Timelapse is built on Dolos, a novel record/replay infrastructure that ensures deterministic execution by capturing and reusing program inputs both from the user and from external sources such as the network. Dolos introduces negligible overhead and does not interfere with breakpoints and logging. In a small user evaluation, participants used Timelapse to accelerate existing reproduction activities, but were not significantly faster or more successful in completing the larger tasks at hand. Together, the Dolos infrastructure and Timelapse developer tool support systematic bug reporting and debugging practices."
27546,14040,22113,Collaborative filtering on ordinal user feedback,2013,"We propose a collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation framework which is based on viewing user feedback on products as ordinal, rather than the more common numerical view. Such an ordinal view frequently provides a more natural reflection of the user intention when providing qualitative ratings, allowing users to have different internal scoring scales. Moreover, we can address scenarios where assigning numerical scores to different types of user feedback would not be easy. The framework can wrap most collaborative filtering algorithms, enabling algorithms previously designed for numerical values to handle ordinal values. We demonstrate our framework by wrapping a leading matrix factorization CF method. A cornerstone of our method is its ability to predict a full probability distribution of the expected item ratings, rather than only a single score for an item. One of the advantages this brings is a novel approach to estimating the confidence level in each individual prediction. Compared to previous approaches to confidence estimation, ours is more principled and empirically superior in its accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on two of the largest publicly available datasets: the Netflix data and the Yahoo! Music data."
1711256,14040,9896,Computer Interaction Analysis: Toward an Empirical Approach to Understanding User Practice and Eye Gaze in GUI-Based Interaction,2011,"Today's personal computers enable complex forms of user interaction. Unlike older mainframe computers that required batch processing, personal computers enable real-time user control on a one-to-one basis. Such user interaction involves mixed initiative, logic, language and pointing gestures, features reminiscent of interaction with another human. Yet there are also major differences between computer interaction and human interaction, such as computers' inability to stray from scripts or to adapt to the idiosyncrasies of particular recipients or situations. Given these similarities and differences, can we study computer interaction using methods similar to those for studying human interaction? If so, are the findings from the analysis of human interaction also useful in understanding computer interaction? In this paper, we explore these questions and outline a novel methodological approach for examining human-computer interaction, which we call computer interaction analysis. We build on earlier approaches to human interaction with a computer and adapt them to the latest technologies for computer screen capture and eye tracking. In doing so, we propose a new transcription notation scheme that is designed to represent the interweaving streams of input actions, display events and eye movements. Finally we demonstrate the approach with concrete examples involving the phenomena of placeholding, repair and referential practices."
1805547,14040,11317,"ShrinkyCircuits: sketching, shrinking, and formgiving for electronic circuits",2014,"In this paper we describe the development of ShrinkyCircuits, a novel electronic prototyping technique that captures the flexibility of sketching and leverages properties of a common everyday plastic polymer to enable low-cost, miniature, planar, and curved, multi-layer circuit designs in minutes. ShrinkyCircuits take advantage of inexpensive prestressed polymer film that shrinks to its original size when exposed to heat. This enables improved electrical characteristics though sintering of the conductive electrical layer, partial self-assembly of the circuit and components, and mechanically robust custom shapes Including curves and non-planar form factors. We demonstrate the range and adaptability of ShrinkyCircuits designs from simple hand drawn circuits with through-hole components to complex multilayer, printed circuit boards (PCB), with curved and irregular shaped electronic layouts and surface mount components. Our approach enables users to create extremely customized circuit boards with dense circuit layouts while avoiding messy chemical etching, expensive board milling machines, or time consuming delays in using outside PCB production houses."
1314364,14040,20561,Integrating Business Partners on Demand: The Effect on Capacity Planning for Cost Driven Support Processes,2012,Capacity planning for business processes is still a major challenge. Technology enabling on demand integration of business partners handling peak load at short notice may help. We model a three-stage supply chain with a service provider receiving demand from its customers usually executed by an in-house unit. Alternatively the demand can be routed to external business partners if these offer capacity and a preferable execution. Then the capacity planning problem of the service provider is examined: In what way does this on demand integration capability affect the optimal level of in-house capacity? The model consists of two separate queuing systems (in-house unit and external business partners) along with their relevant cost functions. Furthermore a routing algorithm is developed. It evaluates both systems for every incoming order and decides about routing to the preferable one. To derive results a discrete-event simulation is necessary performed within a case study of the securities trading and settlement process. Three insights are gained: There are situations where on demand integration leads to reduced optimal capacity. Furthermore the risk of allocating an inappropriate amount of capacity can be reduced as well as the total operating costs of the business process.
799576,14040,10237,Adaptive social similarities for recommender systems,2011,"Collaborative filtering (CF) is an effective recommendation technique, which selects items for an individual user based on similar users' preferences. However, CF may not fully reflect the procedure how people choose an item in real life, for users are more likely to ask friends for opinions instead of asking similar strangers. Recently, some recommendation methods based on social network have been raised. These approaches incorporate social network into the CF algorithms and users' preferences can be influenced by the favors of their friends. These social approaches require the knowledge of similarities among friends. There are two popular similarity functions: Vector Space Similarity (VSS) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). However, both friends similarity functions are based on the item-sets they rated in common. In most cases, these functions are impractical, i.e. if two friends do not share the same items in common, the similarity between them will be zeros. To solve this problem, we propose an Adaptive Social Similarity (ASS) function based on the matrix factorization technique. We conduct our experiment on a large dataset: Epinions, which is a widely-used dataset with social information. The experiment results illustrate that our approach outperforms the baseline models and achieves a better performance than social-based method in [4]."
1336603,14040,9896,Augmented virtual identities: facilitating rehabilitation and societal reconnect,2013,"Virtual worlds are well-known as being fantasy spaces sealed off from the real world, but more careful analysis reveals that the boundaries between the real and the virtual are quite porous. Participants or such experiences carry with them their unique set of subjective behavioral assumptions and attitudes that cannot be disentangled from their interactions in the virtual world and vice versa.   Like the real world; these modeled worlds simulate appearances very similar to the real one or a hybrid fantasy; which also dictates the rules and conduct accordingly in the simulated world and potentially in the real world, depending on the immersive-ness of the experience.   From a psychoanalytic viewpoint; these simulations of hybrid fantasies, aspirations or desires originate from within one's own self i.e. the 'unconscious' - a suppressed part of our being which finds itself in control and many a times pampered in these environments, transcending socio-economic, cultural, physical or psychological barriers.   Be it engaging web portals, virtual environments, online multiplayer gaming or a simple Avatar on a common chat client; the depiction of this world is very similar to the real one, involving real-time actions, and communication, where the degree of immediacy may vary according to its usage, intent and design."
262498,14040,21989,The Effect of Presentation on Visual Working Memory,2014,"This paper reports experiments investigating the effect of presenta- tion on visual working memory (VWM) when set-size increases. The capacity of VWM is limited to approximately four items (Luck & Vogel, 1997) and in- creasing set-size impairs the performance in visual tasks. Also, the performance in visuospatial tasks was better in the simultaneous presentation than in the se- quential presentation. However, it is possible that large set-size in the simulta- neous presentation caused overload in visual processing, and also, there is a possibility to increase interference among stimuli.Therefore, we speculated that performance in a simultaneous presentation would show a sharper decrease than in a partitioned presentation, which divides stimuli into two halves in order to reduce visual processing load and interference among stimuli when number of stimuli increases. Thus, the experiments with two types of set-size and two types of presentations (simultaneous and partitioned) were performed.The expe- riment examined whether a probe item was old or novel after seeing 4 or 8 items that appeared at random locations. These items were displayed either in simultaneous or in a partitioned manner. The results revealed a significant inte- raction between set-size and presentation. In a small set-size condition, perfor- mance was better in the simultaneous presentation than in the partitioned pres- entation. However, no difference was found between performances for both presentations in the large set-size condition, as it was influenced by the parti- tioned presentation. The results proposed that the partitioned presentation was more stable method to show items than the simultaneous presentation when set- size is large."
2215306,14040,10237,Local learning of item dissimilarity using content and link structure,2012,"In the  Recommendation Problem , it is often important to find a set of items  similar  to a particular item or a group of items. This problem of finding similar items for the recommendation task may also be viewed as a link prediction problem in a network, where the items can be treated as the nodes. The strength of the edge connecting two items represents the similarity between the items. In this context, a central challenge is to suitably define an appropriate  dissimilarity function  between the items. For content based recommender systems, the dissimilarity function should take into account the individual attributes of the items. The same attribute may have different importances in different parts of the underlying network. We focus on the problem of  learning a suitable dissimilarity function between items  and address it by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem which captures the local weightages of the attributes in different regions of the graph. The constraints are imposed in such a way that the non-connected nodes show higher value of dissimilarity than the connected nodes. The local tuning of the weights learns the optimal value of weights in various parts of the network: from the portions having rich graph information to the portions having only content information. Detailed experimentation shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the Adamic Adar metric as well as logistic regression methodology."
161215,14040,21989,TIDE: Lightweight Device Composition for Enhancing Tabletop Environments with Smartphone Applications,2013,"Interactive surfaces like tabletop computers provide large touch- enabled displays, support novel forms of interaction and collaboration, and extend computation to new environments. However, being a novel platform, the existing application pool is limited and applications existing for other platforms have to be re-developed. At the same time, smartphones are pervasive computers that users carry around and with a large pool of applications. This paper presents TIDE, a lightweight device composition middleware to bring existing smartphone applica- tions onto the tabletop. Through TIDE, applications running on the smartphone are displayed on the tabletop computer, and users can interact with them through the tabletop's interactive surface. TIDE contributes to the areas of device compo- sition and tabletops by providing an OS-level middleware that is transparent to the smartphone applications, maintaining privacy by limiting content transfer between devices, and enhancing the usefulness of tabletops with already existing smart- phone applications and software developers. We present the design and imple- mentation of TIDE, the study of different interaction techniques to manipulate TIDE's interactive content, and an analysis of different research directions. Initial user feedback shows that TIDE is easy to use, learnable, and convenient for colla- borative activities and private environments."
1049678,14040,9896,Crowd synthesis: extracting categories and clusters from complex data,2014,"Analysts synthesize complex, qualitative data to uncover themes and concepts, but the process is time-consuming, cognitively taxing, and automated techniques show mixed success. Crowdsourcing could help this process through on-demand harnessing of flexible and powerful human cognition, but incurs other challenges including limited attention and expertise. Further, text data can be complex, high-dimensional, and ill-structured. We address two major challenges unsolved in prior crowd clustering work: scaffolding expertise for novice crowd workers, and creating consistent and accurate categories when each worker only sees a small portion of the data. To address these challenges we present an empirical study of a two-stage approach to enable crowds to create an accurate and useful overview of a dataset: A) we draw on cognitive theory to assess how re-representing data can shorten and focus the data on salient dimensions; and B) introduce an iterative clustering approach that provides workers a global overview of data. We demonstrate a classification-plus-context approach elicits the most accurate categories at the most useful level of abstraction."
1856175,14040,9896,The Mind's Eye on Personal Profiles: A Cognitive Perspective on Profile Elements that Inform Initial Trustworthiness Assessments and Social Awareness in Virtual Project Teams,2013,"Collaboration in virtual project teams heavily relies on interpersonal trust, for which perceived professional trustworthiness is an important determinant. In face to face teams colleagues form a first impression of each others trustworthiness based on signs and signals that are `naturally' available. However, virtual project team members do not have the same opportunities to assess trustworthiness. This study provides insight in the information elements that virtual project team members value to assess professional trustworthiness in the initial phase of collaboration. The trustworthiness formed initially is highly influential on interpersonal trust formed during latter collaboration. We expect trustors in virtual teams to especially value information elements (= small containers for personal data stimulating the availability of specific information) that provide them with relevant cues of trust warranting properties of a trustee. We identified a list with fifteen information elements that were highly valued across trustors (n?=?226) to inform their trustworthiness assessments. We then analyzed explanations for preferences with the help of a theory-grounded coding scheme for perceived trustworthiness. Results show that respondents value those particular information elements that provide them with multiple cues (signaling multiple trust warranting properties) to assess the trustworthiness of a trustee. Information elements that provide unique cues (signaling for a specific trust warranting property) could not be identified. Insight in these information preferences can inform the design of artefacts, such as personal profile templates, to support acquaintanceships and social awareness especially in the initial phase of a virtual project team."
1654485,14040,20561,An Efficient Preprocessing Algorithm to Speed-Up Multistage Production Decision Optimization Problems,2013,"In this paper we focus on the problem of optimizing a Multistage Production Network (MPN), in which a number of products need to be manufactured. Each product can be produced by one or more assembly node processes, where each assembly is composed of several machines working in parallel. For the required demand of the output products, a decision must be made on how much should be produced by each MPN assembly node, which machines should be on and their output level as to minimize the total production cost. We previously proposed the online-decomposition algorithm (ODA) based on offline preprocessing of static assembly components in order to catalog optimal machine configurations and cost functions for possible assembly outputs. The online ODA uses the preprocessed catalog to decompose the original MPN problem into smaller problems and reduce the exponential search space of machine configurations into a small number of optimal or near optimal machine configurations. Thus, ODA significantly improves the online solution quality and time complexity at the expense of the offline preprocessing. In this paper we focus on preprocessing and propose an adaptive algorithm that considers only a small part of the discretized range of assembly output values, by iteratively classifying outputs based on their predicted machine configuration. We also conduct an initial experimental evaluation, that shows significant improvement in preprocessing time with no reduction in the quality of the online solution."
1688539,14040,9475,A market-based mechanism for providing demand-side regulation service reserves,2011,"We develop a market-based mechanism that enables a building Smart Microgrid Operator (SMO) to offer regulation service reserves and meet the associated obligation of fast response to commands issued by the wholesale market Independent System Operator (ISO) who provides energy and purchases reserves. The proposed market-based mechanism allows the SMO to control the behavior of internal loads through price signals and to provide feedback to the ISO. A regulation service reserves quantity is transacted between the SMO and the ISO for a relatively long period of time (e.g., a one hour long time-scale). During this period the ISO repeatedly requests from the SMO to decrease or increase its consumption. We model the operational task of selecting an optimal short time-scale dynamic pricing policy as a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes average SMO and ISO utility. We then formulate an associated non-linear programming static problem that provides an upper bound on the optimal utility. We study an asymptotic regime in which this upper bound is tight and the static policy provides an efficient approximation of the dynamic pricing policy. We demonstrate, verify and validate the proposed approach through a series of Monte Carlo simulations of the controlled system time trajectories."
1468987,14040,20561,Network Centrality and Contributions to Online Public Good--The Case of Chinese Wikipedia,2012,"Internet technology enables virtual collaboration and plays an important role in knowledge production. However, collaborative technology will not function without conducive underlying social mechanisms. Previous research mostly investigates individual-level motivations of editors, with only a few exceptions examining the collaboration relationships. In this paper, we take a structural perspective and investigate the impact of positions (centralities) of editors in the collaboration networks on their efforts and effort allocations. To achieve this, we empirically reconstruct the dynamic collaboration network of Chinese Wikipedia for the period between 2002 and 2007. Based on a dynamic view of the network, we compose a panel data set that covers both the contribution behavior and network position characteristics of Wikipedia editors. We strengthen our causal interpretation by leveraging the exogenous block that prevented Wikipedia editors in Mainland China from accessing the website. We find distinctive effort allocation patterns that strongly correlate with network centrality measures. This confirms theoretical predictions derived in recent developments in network economics and social network theories. This research enhances our understanding about how collaboration network structure shapes individuals' behavior in online collaboration platforms."
1541642,14040,11166,Who Wrote This? Textual Modeling with Authorship Attribution in Big Data,2014,"By representing large corpora with concise and meaningful elements, topic-based generative models aim to reduce the dimension and understand the content of documents. Those techniques originally analyze on words in the documents, but their extensions currently accommodate meta-data such as authorship information, which has been proved useful for textual modeling. The importance of learning authorship is to extract author interests and assign authors to anonymous texts. Author-Topic (AT) model, an unsupervised learning technique, successfully exploits authorship information to model both documents and author interests using topic representations. However, the AT model simplifies that each author has equal contribution on multiple-author documents. To overcome this limitation, we assumes that authors give different degrees of contributions on a document by using a Dirichlet distribution. This automatically transforms the unsupervised AT model to Supervised Author-Topic (SAT) model, which brings a novelty of authorship prediction on anonymous texts. The SAT model outperforms the AT model for identifying authors of documents written by either single authors or multiple authors with a better Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and a significantly higher Area Under Curve (AUC). The SAT model not only achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art techniques e.g. Random forests but also maintains the characteristics of the unsupervised models for information discovery i.e. Word distributions of topics, author interests, and author contributions."
1688793,14040,9896,Supporting air traffic control collaboration with a TableTop system,2011,"Collaboration is key to safety and efficiency in Air Traffic Control. Legacy paper-based systems enable seamless and non-verbal collaboration, but trends in new software and hardware for ATC tend to separate controllers more and more, which hinders collaboration. This paper presents a new interactive system designed to support collaboration in ATC. We ran a series of interviews and workshops to identify collaborative situations in ATC. From this analysis, we derived a set of requirements to support collaboration: support mutual awareness, communication and coordination, dynamic task allocation and simultaneous use with more than two people. We designed a set of new interactive tools to fulfill the requirements, by using a multi-user tabletop surface, appropriate feedthrough, and reified and partially-accomplishable actions. Preliminary evaluation shows that feedthrough is important, users benefit from a number of tools to communicate and coordinate their actions, and the tabletop is actually usable by three people both in tightly coupled tasks and parallel, individual activities. At a higher level, we also found that co-location is not enough to generate mutual awareness if users are not engaged in meaningful collaboration."
1837821,14040,20358,A proximity-based fallback model for hybrid web recommender systems,2013,"Although there are numerous websites that provide recommendation services for various items such as movies, music, and books, most of studies on recommender systems only focus on one specific item type. As recommender sites expand to cover several types of items, though, it is important to build a hybrid web recommender system that can handle multiple types of items.   The switch hybrid recommender model provides a solution to this problem by choosing an appropriate recommender system according to given selection criteria, thereby facilitating cross-domain recommendations supported by individual recommender systems. This paper seeks to answer the question of how to deal with situations where no appropriate recommender system exists to deal with a required type of item. In such cases, the switch model cannot generate recommendation results, leading to the need for a fallback model that can satisfy most users most of the time.   Our fallback model exploits a graph-based proximity search, ranking every entity on the graph according to a given proximity measure. We study how to incorporate the fallback model into the switch model, and propose a general architecture and simple algorithms for implementing these ideas. Finally, we present the results of our research result and discuss remaining challenges and possibilities for future research."
1944729,14040,422,Active learning for online bayesian matrix factorization,2012,"The problem of large-scale online matrix completion is addressed via a Bayesian approach. The proposed method learns a factor analysis (FA) model for large matrices, based on a small number of observed matrix elements, and leverages the statistical model to actively select which new matrix entries/observations would be most informative if they could be acquired, to improve the model; the model inference and active learning are performed in an online setting. In the context of online learning, a greedy, fast and provably near-optimal algorithm is employed to sequentially maximize the mutual information between past and future observations, taking advantage of submodularity properties. Additionally, a simpler procedure, which directly uses the posterior parameters learned by the Bayesian approach, is shown to achieve slightly lower estimation quality, with far less computational effort. Inference is performed using a computationally efficient online variational Bayes (VB) procedure. Competitive results are obtained in a very large collaborative filtering problem, namely the Yahoo! Music ratings dataset."
897516,14040,10237,Sample selection for MCMC-based recommender systems,2013,"Bayesian Inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has been shown to provide high prediction quality in recommender systems. The advantage over learning methods such as coordinate descent/alternating least-squares (ALS) or (stochastic) gradient descent (SGD) is that MCMC takes uncertainty into account and moreover MCMC can easily integrate priors to learn regularization values. For factorization models, MCMC inference can be done with efficient Gibbs samplers.   However, MCMC algorithms are not point estimators, but they generate a chain of models. The whole chain of models is used to calculate predictions. For large scale models like factorization methods with millions or billions of model parameters, saving the whole chain of models is very storage intensive and can even get infeasible in practice. In this paper, we address this problem and show how a small subset from the chain of models can approximate the predictive distribution well. We use the fact that models from the chain are correlated and propose online selection techniques to store only a small subset of the models. We perform an empirical analysis on the large scale Netflix dataset with several Bayesian factorization models, including matrix factorization and SVD++. We show that the proposed selection techniques approximate the predictions well with only a small subset of model samples."
2054017,14040,9896,Markup as you talk: establishing effective memory cues while still contributing to a meeting,2012,"Meeting participants can experience cognitive overload when they need both to verbally contribute to ongoing discussion while simultaneously creating notes to promote later recall of decisions made during the meeting. We designed two novel cuing tools to reduce the cognitive load associated with note-taking, thus improving verbal contributions in meetings. The tools combine real-time automatic speech recognition (ASR) with lightweight annotation to transform note-taking into a low overhead markup process. To create lightweight notes, users do not generate the notes' content themselves. Instead they simply highlight important phrases in a real-time ASR transcript (Highlighter tool), or press a button to indicate when they heard something important (Hotspots tool). We evaluated these markup tools against a traditional pen-and-paper baseline with 26 users. Hotspots was highly successful: compared with handwritten notes, it increased participants' conversational contributions and reduced their perception of overload in the meeting, while improving recall of the meeting two months later. Highlighter also improved recall without compromising conversational contributions, although users found it more demanding."
710222,14040,10237,Deviation-based and similarity-based contextual SLIM recommendation algorithms,2014,"Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) have been demonstrated to be able to enhance recommendations by adapting users' preferences to different contextual situations. In recent years, several CARS algorithms have been developed to incorporated into the recommender systems. For example, differential context modeling (DCM) was modified based on traditional neighborhood collaborative filtering (NBCF), context-aware matrix factorization (CAMF) coupled contextual dependency with the matrix factorization technique (MF), and tensor factorization directly models contexts as additional dimensions in the multi-dimensional space, etc. CAMF works well but it is difficult to interpret the latent features in the algorithm. DCM is good for explanation but it may only work well on data sets with dense contextual ratings. Recently, we successfully incorporate contexts into Sparse LInear Method (SLIM) and develop contextual SLIM (CSLIM) recommendation algorithms which take advantages of both NBCF and MF. CSLIM are demonstrated as more effective and promising context-aware recommenders. In this work, we provide the introduction on the framework of the CSLIM algorithms, present the current state of the research, and discuss our ongoing future work to develop and improve our CSLIM models for context-aware recommendations."
1427369,14040,20411,Collaborative personalized tweet recommendation,2012,"Twitter has rapidly grown to a popular social network in recent years and provides a large number of real-time messages for users. Tweets are presented in chronological order and users scan the followees' timelines to find what they are interested in. However, an information overload problem has troubled many users, especially those with many followees and thousands of tweets arriving every day. In this paper, we focus on recommending useful tweets that users are really interested in personally to reduce the users' effort to find useful information. Many kinds of information on Twitter are available for helping recommendation, including the user's own tweet history, retweet history and social relations between users. We propose a method of making tweet recommendations based on collaborative ranking to capture personal interests. It can also conveniently integrate the other useful contextual information. Our final method considers three major elements on Twitter: tweet topic level factors, user social relation factors and explicit features such as authority of the publisher and quality of the tweet. The experiments show that all the proposed elements are important and our method greatly outperforms several baseline methods."
2335858,14040,20561,Breathing New Life into Static Materials,2011,"Many libraries have large quantities of books that are rarely used. A practice that is becoming increasingly popular is to put them in remote repositories, which often only expedites their pace into oblivion. We call such collections static materials because of their extremely low usage rate. In this paper we propose a method which, through digitization, gives them a new life. Our approach starts with identifying a feasible objective that could make a 'collection' emerge from certain static materials, then systematically extract and digitize objects of the selected theme from those materials. The resulting collection from such a practice may be unique, significant, and useful. We demonstrate this idea by describing a digital library of old photographs of Taiwan, extracted almost exclusively from existing pre-1945 Japanese books held in the National Taiwan University Library. This collection, numbered at 39,743, covers a wide spectrum of topics, and fills a visual documentary void in Taiwanese history. This digital library can be accessed at http://photo.lib.ntu.edu.tw/pic/db/oldphoto.jsp"
1997548,14040,10237,"Distributed, real-time bayesian learning in online services",2012,"The last ten years have seen a tremendous growth in Internet-based online services such as search, advertising, gaming and social networking. Today, it is important to analyze large collections of user interaction data as a first step in building predictive models for these services as well as learn these models in real-time. One of the biggest challenges in this setting is scale: not only does the sheer scale of data necessitate parallel processing but it also necessitates distributed models; with over 900 million active users at Facebook, any user-specific sets of features in a linear or non-linear model yields models of a size bigger than can be stored in a single system.   In this talk, I will give a hands-on introduction to one of the most versatile tools for handling large collections of data with distributed probabilistic models: the sum-product algorithm for approximate message passing in factor graphs. I will discuss the application of this algorithm for the specific case of generalized linear models and outline the challenges of both approximate and distributed message passing including an in-depth discussion of expectation propagation and Map-Reduce."
1608603,14040,20561,Networks of Change: Learning from Peers about Science Teaching,2014,"Rapid changes in the knowledge base of science raise challenges on how to disseminate new knowledge and associated pedagogical practices to pre-college teachers. Accelerating that process by seeding knowledge in a network for dissemination and adoption is one aim of the `EnLiST' NSF-funded project on entrepreneurial leadership in STEM teaching and learning. As part of that initiative, a study was conducted to explore how teachers' networks support learning about new teaching practices. Questionnaire and interview data address how and from whom teachers learn about the teaching of science. Results show that information about science teaching techniques is of primary importance, most trusted from those who share the common experience of the classroom. New science content from wider contacts is `refreshing', but most valued when tied to teaching practice. Classroom management, matters external to their school, and administrative matters also form learning networks. All learning is best received in amounts that fit `in just as much time as I have'. Results help understand how communication practices fit with existing cultural practice and teacher learning, how such interaction may be examined from a social network perspective, and how technology may support such networks."
281666,14040,20332,Crowdsourcing a HIT: Measuring Workers' Pre-Task Interactions on Microtask Markets,2013,"The ability to entice and engage crowd workers to participate in human intelligence tasks (HITs) is critical for many human computation systems and large-scale experiments. While various metrics have been devised to measure and improve the quality of worker output via task designs, effective recruitment of crowd workers is often overlooked. To help us gain a better understanding of crowd recruitment strategies we propose three new metrics for measuring crowd workers' willingness to participate in advertised HITs: conversion rate, conversion rate over time, and nominal conversion rate. We discuss how the conversion rate of workers—the number of potential workers aware of a task that choose to accept the task—can affect the quantity, quality, and validity of any data collected via crowdsourcing. We also contribute a tool — turkmill — that enables requesters on Amazon Mechanical Turk to easily measure the conversion rate of HITs. We then present the results of two experiments that demonstrate how conversion rate metrics can be used to evaluate the effect of different HIT designs. We investigate how four HIT design features (value proposition, branding, quality of presentation, and intrinsic motivation) affect conversion rates. Among other things, we find that including a clear value proposition has a strong significant, positive effect on the nominal conversion rate. We also find that crowd workers prefer commercial entities to non-profit or university requesters."
2342253,14040,20561,Political Communication and Influence through Microblogging--An Empirical Analysis of Sentiment in Twitter Messages and Retweet Behavior,2012,"Microblogging services such as Twitter are said to have the potential for increasing political participation. Given the feature of 'retweeting' as a simple yet powerful mechanism for information diffusion, Twitter is an ideal platform for users to spread not only information in general but also political opinions through their networks as Twitter may also be used to publicly agree with, as well as to reinforce, someone's political opinions or thoughts. Besides their content and intended use, Twitter messages ('tweets') also often convey pertinent information about their author's sentiment. In this paper, we seek to examine whether sentiment occurring in politically relevant tweets has an effect on their retweetability (i.e., how often these tweets will be retweeted). Based on a data set of 64,431 political tweets, we find a positive relationship between the quantity of words indicating affective dimensions, including positive and negative emotions associated with certain political parties or politicians, in a tweet and its retweet rate. Furthermore, we investigate how political discussions take place in the Twitter network during periods of political elections with a focus on the most active and most influential users. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of our results."
51855,14040,21989,Extending Mobile Interfaces with External Screens,2013,"Mobile phones allow for the use of all kinds of applications, and their mobile applications often provide similar functionalities as desktop applica- tions. However, they are constrained by the limited screen size of the mobile device. Accordingly, designs of mobile user interfaces require optimization for small screens. As a consequence, users are provided with less context and often have to switch views or resize content such as maps or pictures. We present MobIES 1 , a novel approach for extending mobile user interfaces by using exter- nal screens (e.g., the mobile phone and a large screen). Users can utilize more space and can thus overview a larger information context. We present a novel interaction and application concept and describe how user interfaces can be spanned across displays. Further, we contribute an original approach for using Near Field Communication to detect the devices' spatial relation. We report on a user study which compared MobIES with standard mobile settings. Results from the system usability scale show that interaction with MobIES is subjective- ly more usable. Furthermore, it provides higher perceived information clarity and supports faster sharing of information to others."
1609635,14040,23876,Manhattan: Supporting real-time visual team activity awareness,2013,"Collaboration is essential for the development of complex software systems. An important aspect of collaboration is team awareness: The understanding of the activity of others that provides a context for one's activity. We claim that the current IDE support for awareness is inadequate: The typical setting is to rely on software configuration management systems (SCMs), which are based on an explicit check-out/check-in model. If developers rely only on SCMs information, they become aware of concurrent changes only when they commit their code to the repository. This generates problems such as complex merging and redundant work. Most tools to raise awareness notify developers of emerging conflicts in the form of textual notifications. We propose to improve the notification by using real-time visualization integrated in the IDE to notify developers of team activity. Our approach, implemented in a tool called Manhattan, eases team activity comprehension by relying on a city metaphor. Manhattan depicts a software system as a live city that changes as the underlying system evolves. Within the city, Manhattan renders team activity information, updating developers in real-time about changes implemented by the entire development team. Further, Manhattan provides programmers with immediate feedback about emerging conflicts in which they are involved."
2236534,14040,21989,JIT Compilation Policy on Single-Core and Multi-core Machines,2011,"Dynamic or Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation is crucial to achieve acceptable performance for applications written in traditionally interpreted languages, such as Java and C#. Such languages enable the generation of portable applications that are written and compiled once, and can be executed by a virtual machine on any supported architecture. However, by virtue of occurring at runtime, dynamic compilation adds to the overall execution time of the application, and can potentially slow down program execution if performed injudiciously. Selective compilation is a technique that was developed for single-core architectures to manage the compilation overhead by dynamically determining and compiling only the most critical program regions. Current processors have evolved from single-core machines to those supporting multiple tightly-integrated cores. Consequently, research is needed to explore the best JIT compilation policy on multi-core machines with several concurrent compiler threads. In this paper, we present novel experimental configurations to understand the benefits of dynamic compilation, and find the best JIT compilation policies on single and multi-core machines. Our results validate earlier claims that compiling a small percentage of methods has an inordinately large impact on performance. We show that spawning a greater number of simultaneous compiler threads can achieve better program performance on single-core machines. Our results also reveal that more than an increase in compiler aggressiveness, a small increase in the number of compiler threads achieves the best application performance on multi-core machines."
837832,14040,10237,REDD 2014 -- international workshop on recommender systems evaluation: dimensions and design,2014,"Evaluation is a cardinal issue in recommender systems; as in any technical discipline, it highlights to a large extent the problems that need to be solved by the field and, hence, leads the way for algorithmic research and development in the community. Yet, in the field of recommender systems, there still exists considerable disparity in evaluation methods, metrics and experimental designs, as well as a significant mismatch between evaluation methods in the lab and what constitutes an effective recommendation for real users and businesses. Even after the relevant quality dimensions have been defined, a clear evaluation protocol should be specified in detail and agreed upon, allowing for the comparison of results and experiments conducted by different authors. This would enable any contribution to the same problem to be incremental and add up on top of previous work, rather than grow sideways. The REDD 2014 workshop seeks to provide an informal forum to tackle such issues and to move towards better understood and shared evaluation methodologies, allowing one to leverage the efforts and the workforce of the academic community towards meaningful and relevant directions in real-world developments."
861229,14040,11317,Pause-and-play: automatically linking screencast video tutorials with applications,2011,"Video tutorials provide a convenient means for novices to learn new software applications. Unfortunately, staying in sync with a video while trying to use the target application at the same time requires users to repeatedly switch from the application to the video to pause or scrub backwards to replay missed steps. We present Pause-and-Play, a system that helps users work along with existing video tutorials. Pause-and-Play detects important events in the video and links them with corresponding events in the target application as the user tries to replicate the depicted procedure. This linking allows our system to automatically pause and play the video to stay in sync with the user. Pause-and-Play also supports convenient video navigation controls that are accessible from within the target application and allow the user to easily replay portions of the video without switching focus out of the application. Finally, since our system uses computer vision to detect events in existing videos and leverages application scripting APIs to obtain real time usage traces, our approach is largely independent of the specific target application and does not require access or modifications to application source code. We have implemented Pause-and-Play for two target applications, Google SketchUp and Adobe Photoshop, and we report on a user study that shows our system improves the user experience of working with video tutorials."
389622,14040,20358,Defending imitating attacks in web credibility evaluation systems,2013,"Unlike traditional media such as television and newspapers, web contents are relatively easy to be published without being rigorously fact-checked. This seriously influences people's daily life if non-credible web contents are utilized for decision making. Recently, web credibility evaluation systems have emerged where web credibility is derived by aggregating ratings from the community (e.g., MyWOT). In this paper, We focus on the robustness of such systems by identifying a new type of attack scenario where an attacker imitates the behavior of trustworthy experts by copying system's credibility ratings to quickly build high reputation and then attack certain web contents. In order to defend this attack, we propose a two-stage defence algorithm. At stage 1, our algorithm applies supervised learning algorithm to predict the credibility of a web content and compare it with a user's rating to estimate whether this user is malicious or not. In case the user's maliciousness can not be determined with high confidence, the algorithm goes to stage 2 where we investigate users' past rating patterns and detect the malicious one by applying hierarchical clustering algorithm. Evaluation using real datasets demonstrates the efficacy of our approach."
1990318,14040,20854,Value biases of sensor-based assistive technology: case study of a GPS tracking system used in dementia care,2012,"We investigate a conventional GPS tracking system employed in professional dementia care in search of value biases that contradict central care values. The investigation follows the formal steps of the value-sensitive design approach. Four biases are identified. These are related to: augmentation, privacy, self-esteem, and trust and accountability. Drawing on data gathered through a field experiment and related focus group meetings, professional stakeholders' responses and attitudes towards these biases are accounted for. The main lessons learned form our investigation are as follows: Firstly, this study highlights the situation that stakeholders' concerns about sensor-based assistive technology in dementia care often relate to specific value-laden design aspects or features. Secondly, we consider the identified biases central issues that need to be taken into account in ethical evaluations of the uptake and adoption of sensor-based technologies in dementia care. For designers of assistive technologies the biases identified represent areas for improvements. Thirdly, the study strengthens the argument that ethics and human values need to be paid explicit attention as part of human-centered design processes that target the care sector."
1954075,14040,9896,Analyzing the quality of information solicited from targeted strangers on social media,2013,"The emergence of social media creates a unique opportunity for developing a new class of crowd-powered information collection systems. Such systems actively identify potential users based on their public social media posts and solicit them directly for information. While studies have shown that users will respond to solicitations in a few domains, there is little analysis of the quality of information received. Here we explore the quality of information solicited from Twitter users in the domain of product reviews, specifically reviews for a popular tablet computer and L.A.-based food trucks. Our results show that the majority of responses to our questions (>70%) contained relevant information and often provided additional details (>37%) beyond the topic of the question. We compare the solicited Twitter reviews to other user-generated reviews from Amazon and Yelp, and found that the Twitter answers provided similar information when controlling for the questions asked. Our results also reveal limitations of this new information collection method, including its suitability in certain domains and potential technical barriers to its implementation. Our work provides strong evidence for the potential of this new class of information collection systems and design implications for their future use."
1726807,14040,10237,Improving the discriminative power of inferred content information using segmented virtual profile,2014,"We present a novel component of a hybrid recommender system at LinkedIn, where item features are augmented by a  virtual profile  based on observed user-item interactions. A virtual profile is generated by representing an item in the user feature space and leveraging the overrepresented user features from users who interacted with the item. It is a way to think about Collaborative Filtering with content features. The core principle is that if the feature occurs with high probability for the users who interacted with an item (henceforth termed as relevant users) versus those who did not (henceforth termed as non-relevant users), then that feature is a good candidate to be included in the virtual profile of the item in question. However, this scheme suffers from the data imbalance problem because observed relevant users are usually an extremely small minority group compared to the whole user base. Feature selection in this skewed setting is prone to noise from the overwhelming non-relevant examples that belong to the majority group. To alleviate the problem, we propose a method to select the most relevant non-relevant examples from the majority group by segmenting users on certain intelligently selected feature dimensions. The resulting virtual profile from the method is called the  segmented virtual profile . Empirical evaluation on a real-world large scale recommender system at LinkedIn shows that our strategies for segmentation yield significantly better results."
2338005,14040,20854,PianoText: redesigning the piano keyboard for text entry,2014,"Inspired by the high keying rates of skilled pianists, we study the design of piano keyboards for rapid text entry. We review the qualities of the piano as an input device, observing four design opportunities: 1) chords, 2) redundancy (more keys than letters in English), 3) the transfer of musical skill and 4) optional sound feedback. Although some have been utilized in previous text entry methods, our goal is to exploit all four in a single design. We present  PianoText , a computationally designed mapping that assigns letter sequences of English to frequent note transitions of music. It allows fast text entry on any MIDI-enabled keyboard and was evaluated in two transcription typing studies. Both show an achievable rate of over 80 words per minute. This parallels the rates of expert Qwerty typists and doubles that of a previous piano-based design from the 19th century. We also design  PianoText-Mini , which allows for comparable performance in a portable form factor. Informed by the studies, we estimate the upper bound of typing performance, draw implications to other text entry methods, and critically discuss outstanding design challenges."
1324660,14040,10237,Generating supplemental content information using virtual profiles,2013,"We describe a hybrid recommendation system at LinkedIn that seeks to optimally extract relevant information pertaining to items to be recommended. By extending the notion of an item profile, we propose the concept of a virtual profile that augments the content of the item with rich set of features inherited from members who have already shown explicit interest in it. Unlike item-based collaborative filtering, we focus on discovering the characteristic descriptors that underlie the item-user association. Such information is used as supplemental features in a content-based filtering system. The main objective of virtual profiles is to provide a means to tap into rich-content information from one type of entity and propagate features extracted from which to other affiliated entities that may suffer from relative data scarcity. We empirically evaluate the proposed method on a real-world community recommendation problem at LinkedIn. The result shows that the virtual profiles outperform a collaborative filtering based approach (user who likes this also likes that). In particular, the improvement is more significant for new users with only limited connections, demonstrating the capability of the method to address the cold-start problem in pure collaborative filtering systems."
2040776,14040,20561,What Makes IT Personnel Adopt Scrum? A Framework of Drivers and Inhibitors to Developer Acceptance,2011,"In recent years, the agile Scrum methodology has become a popular software development approach. It significantly differs from traditional approaches as it promotes communication, self-organization, flexibility, and innovation instead of extensive planning and codified processes. While such a paradigm shift promises to better support the timely delivery of high-quality software in turbulent business environments, its success considerably depends on the willingness of developers to adopt the agile methodology. In this paper, we present a framework with drivers and inhibitors to the developer acceptance of Scrum. It combines analytical with empirical findings and can be used as a theoretical basis to empirically evaluate the actual support of Scrum in concrete scenarios. The introduced framework is based on the extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which has been proven to be also applicable to describe the intention of developers to use a methodology. Building upon results from qualitative in-depth interviews with six experienced Scrum experts of a German DAX-30 company, we refine the general determinants of adoption contained in the TAM with several observed factors that influence the willingness of developers to use Scrum in practice."
1765605,14040,20561,Investigating the Trend of Non-Task Social Interactions in Online Collaborative Learning Environments,2011,"While there have been many studies on instructional and on-task side of computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL), social and non-task side of the CSCL has received less attention. This paper observes and studies the pattern of non-task social messaging over a period of time in online Seminar rooms -designed for learning activities- as well as Coffee shops- designed for informal conversations. The objective is to firstly uncover the pattern of social interactions in the online collaborative learning environment and, secondly to understand how the level of social interactions changes over time and what factors facilitate and lead such changes. Transcript Analysis Tool (TAT) has been used to code discussions of three online classes during a 10-week postgraduate summer course in an Australian university. Findings have indicated existence of a substantial amount of non-task interactions among students. Furthermore, the results have shown a larger amount of non-task interactions occurred at the beginning and end of the semester as well as during some special occasions. Students' willingness to share personal and work-related experiences with other classmates is amongst top factors leading such trend in social interactions in the environment."
1167490,14040,20854,Unexpected journeys with the HOBBIT: the design and evaluation of an asocial hiking app,2014,"In the age of mobile communications and social media, users are connected to interact with other people, and often obliged to be socially active as technology drives to connect us. In this paper, we harness the technology for the opposite use: helping people to avoid company instead of encouraging interaction. We have developed the concept of an asocial hiking application (app), in which users can generate routes that avoid meeting other people. We developed the concept based on user feedback data derived from an online survey (n=157) and two focus groups, and created a tool that generates solitary hiking routes based on OpenStreetMap data and additional information from the web. In addition, to make the application react to dynamic changes in the environment, we developed a mobile application prototype that scans Wi-Fi signals to detect other hikers nearby and warn of their approach. The prototype was tested and evaluated with 8 hikers in-the-wild. In addition to the concept design and the functional prototype, we present findings on people's, especially hikers, need for solitude, and introduce user feedback from each stage of the prototype design process as well as design recommendations for an asocial navigation application."
2483289,14040,11317,Chorus: a crowd-powered conversational assistant,2013,"Despite decades of research attempting to establish conversational interaction between humans and computers, the capabilities of automated conversational systems are still limited. In this paper, we introduce Chorus, a crowd-powered conversational assistant. When using Chorus, end users converse continuously with what appears to be a single conversational partner. Behind the scenes, Chorus leverages multiple crowd workers to propose and vote on responses. A shared memory space helps the dynamic crowd workforce maintain consistency, and a game-theoretic incentive mechanism helps to balance their efforts between proposing and voting. Studies with 12 end users and 100 crowd workers demonstrate that Chorus can provide accurate, topical responses, answering nearly 93% of user queries appropriately, and staying on-topic in over 95% of responses. We also observed that Chorus has advantages over pairing an end user with a single crowd worker and end users completing their own tasks in terms of speed, quality, and breadth of assistance. Chorus demonstrates a new future in which conversational assistants are made usable in the real world by combining human and machine intelligence, and may enable a useful new way of interacting with the crowds powering other systems."
1790009,14040,20561,Key IT Management Issues in Canadian Hospitals: A Delphi Study,2011,"Information technologies have become essential components in health care organizations given their potential for enabling better quality of care, improving productivity and efficiency, and supporting new approaches for patient management. Subsequently, IT executives are facing a dynamic and demanding environment that present new issues, challenges, and opportunities. This study aims at gaining a better understanding of the key IT management issues facing IT executives over the next three years. We address this question by conducting a Delphi survey among 30 CIOs / IT directors in Canadian hospitals. Three simultaneous surveys were conducted in different settings: rural / small, community, and academic hospitals. The results demonstrate considerable similarities in the issues identified by the three panels. The most critical issues included managing demands and expectations for IT services, having sufficient funds, recognizing IT as a key stakeholder in major decisions, implementing EHR, and aligning strategy across hospitals, heath networks and the province. We conclude by discussing implications of our preliminary findings for both research and practice."
1388537,14040,20561,The System Impact of Travel Demand Variability in the Context of Electric Vehicles,2013,"The introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) represents an unprecedented interaction between the road network and electricity grid. In this new integrated system, travel demand, behavior, and traffic congestion will influence the temporal and spatial characteristics of electricity usage and environmental impacts. Furthermore, uncertainty in the transport characteristics will manifest as a new uncertainty placed on electrical infrastructure. Overall, the realized system-level impacts depend on the eventual penetration of PEV ownership. However the true market share of PEVs in the future is highly unclear and radically different scenarios are possible. This added forecasting volatility makes long-term transport models that explicitly consider travel demand uncertainty even more critical. This work utilizes transport modeling tools in order to quantify the relationship between the travel patterns of PEV drivers and PEV energy consumption rates. Furthermore, this research explicitly addresses the relationship between long term travel demand uncertainty and system level energy consumption variability, an essential issue for regional energy providers and planners. Implications are demonstrated on the Sioux Falls network."
1180285,14040,20411,Functional matrix factorizations for cold-start recommendation,2011,"A key challenge in recommender system research is how to effectively profile  new  users, a problem generally known as  cold-start  recommendation. Recently the idea of progressively  querying  user responses through an  initial interview  process has been proposed as a useful new user preference elicitation strategy. In this paper, we present  functional matrix factorization  (fMF), a novel cold-start recommendation method that solves the problem of initial interview construction within the context of learning user and item profiles. Specifically, fMF constructs a decision tree for the initial interview with each node being an interview question, enabling the recommender to query a user adaptively according to her prior responses. More importantly, we associate latent profiles for each node of the tree --- in effect restricting the latent profiles to be a function of possible answers to the interview questions --- which allows the profiles to be gradually refined through the interview process based on user responses. We develop an iterative optimization algorithm that alternates between decision tree construction and latent profiles extraction as well as a regularization scheme that takes into account of the tree structure. Experimental results on three benchmark recommendation data sets demonstrate that the proposed fMF algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods for cold-start recommendation."
31833,14040,21989,Dynamic Tangible User Interface Palettes,2013,"Graphics editors often suffer from a large number of tool palettes that compete with valuable document space. To address this problem and to bring back physical affordances similar to a painter's palette, we propose to augment a digital tabletop with spatially tracked handheld displays. These displays are dynamically updated depending on their spatial location. We introduce the con- cept of spatial Work Zones that take up distinct 3D regions above the table sur- face and serve as physical containers for digital content that is organized as stacks of horizontal layers. Spatial Work Zones are represented either by physi- cal objects or on-screen on the tabletop. Associated layers can be explored fluently by entering a spatial Work Zone with a handheld display. This provides quick access and seamless changes between tools and parts of the document that are instantly functional, i.e., ready to be used by a digital pen. We discuss several use cases illustrating our techniques and setting them into context with previous systems. Early user feedback indicates that combining dynamic GUI functionality with the physicality of spatially tracked handheld displays is promising and can be generalized beyond graphics editing."
1217486,14040,23827,Supported approach for agile methods adaptation: an adoption study,2014,"Adopting agile software development methods is a wide and complex organisational change that usually impacts several aspects of the organisation (e.g., its structure, culture, management practices, produced artefacts, technologies in use, etc). In order to successfully handle the several key challenges, it's crucial to understand the organisation context and carefully study the transformation strategies.     This paper presents an agile transformation experience that has been undertaken in a public organisation in Belgium and during which Scrum was applied in two pilot projects. The first project retrospective shows that the change cannot be accomplished only at the team-level without taking into account the overall structure of the organisation and that we must carefully evolve toward a context-specific adapted method. In the second pilot project, we defined structured and repeatable steps to assist the adoption of agile practices. The experience shows the usefulness of such an approach but suggests that automation efforts should be addressed.     The last section of the paper summarizes the issues encountered and presents the AM-QuICK framework which aims at providing a supported approach to guide the agile adoption, adaptation and assessment."
741637,14040,20561,A Business Process Management Approach to Perioperative Supplies/Instrument Inventory and Workflow,2014,"This study examines business process management practices applied to monitor, measure, and improve a hospital's perioperative supply workflow and corresponding inventory management. This paper identifies how dynamic technological activities of analysis, evaluation, and synthesis applied to internal and external organizational data can highlight complex relationships within integrated hospital processes to target opportunities for improvement and ultimately yield improved process capabilities. The identification of existing limitations, potential capabilities, and the subsequent contextual understanding are contributing factors that yield measured improvement within a hospital's perioperative process. Based on a 10-year longitudinal study of a large 909 registered-bed teaching hospital, this case study investigates the impact of integrated information systems to identify, qualify, and quantify business analytics used to improve perioperative efficiency and effectiveness across patient quality of care, operational efficiency, and financial cost effectiveness. The theoretical and practical implications and/or limitations of this study's results are also discussed with respect to practitioners and researchers alike."
1465203,14040,9896,What is a file,2013,"For over 40 years the notion of the  file , as devised by pioneers in the field of computing, has been the subject of much contention. Some have wanted to abandon the term altogether on the grounds that metaphors about files can confuse users and designers alike. More recently, the emergence of the 'cloud' has led some to suggest that the term is simply obsolescent. In this paper we want to suggest that, despite all these conceptual debates and changes in technology, the term file still remains central to systems architectures and to the concerns of users. Notwithstanding profound changes in what users do and technologies afford, we suggest that files continue to act as a cohering concept, something like a 'boundary object' between computer engineers and users. However, the effectiveness of this boundary object is now waning. There are increasing signs of slippage and muddle. Instead of throwing away the notion altogether, we propose that the definition of and use of files as a boundary object be reconstituted. New abstractions are needed, ones which reflect what users seek to do with their digital data, and which allow engineers to solve the networking, storage and data management problems that ensue when files move from the PC on to the networked world of today."
1943738,14040,11317,Swipeboard: a text entry technique for ultra-small interfaces that supports novice to expert transitions,2014,"Ultra-small smart devices, such as smart watches, have become increasingly popular in recent years. Most of these devices rely on touch as the primary input modality, which makes tasks such as text entry increasingly difficult as the devices continue to shrink. In the sole pursuit of entry speed, the ultimate solution is a shorthand technique (e.g., Morse code) that sequences tokens of input (e.g., key, tap, swipe) into unique representations of each character. However, learning such techniques is hard, as it often resorts to rote memory. Our technique, Swipeboard, leverages our spatial memory of a QWERTY keyboard to learn, and eventually master a shorthand, eyes-free text entry method designed for ultra-small interfaces. Characters are entered with two swipes; the first swipe specifies the region where the character is located, and the second swipe specifies the character within that region. Our study showed that with less than two hours' training, Tested on a reduced word set, Swipeboard users achieved 19.58 words per minute (WPM), 15% faster than an existing baseline technique."
2228972,14040,11317,"Sketch-editing games: human-machine communication, game theory and applications",2012,"We study uncertainty in graphical-based interaction (with special attention to sketches). We argue that a comprehensive model for the problem must include the interaction participants (and their current beliefs), their possible actions and their past sketches. It's yet unclear how to frame and solve the former problem, considering all the latter elements. We suggest framing the problem as a game and solving it with a game-theoretical solution, which leads to a framework for the design of new two-way, sketch-based user interfaces. In special, we use the framework to design a game that can progressively learn visual models of objects from user sketches, and use the models in real-world interactions. Instead of an abstract visual criterion, players in this game learn models to optimize interaction (the game's duration). This two-way sketching game addresses problems essential in emerging interfaces (such as learning and how to deal with interpretation errors). We review possible applications in robotic sketch-to-command, hand gesture recognition, media authoring and visual search, and evaluate two. Evaluations demonstrate how players improve performance with repeated play, and the influence of interaction aspects on learning."
114104,14040,22113,Transfer learning to predict missing ratings via heterogeneous user feedbacks,2011,"Data sparsity due to missing ratings is a major challenge for collaborative filtering (CF) techniques in recommender systems. This is especially true for CF domains where the ratings are expressed numerically. We observe that, while we may lack the information in numerical ratings, we may have more data in the form of binary ratings. This is especially true when users can easily express themselves with their likes and dislikes for certain items. In this paper, we explore how to use the binary preference data expressed in the form of like/dislike to help reduce the impact of data sparsity of more expressive numerical ratings. We do this by transferring the rating knowledge from some auxiliary data source in binary form (that is, likes or dislikes), to a target numerical rating matrix. Our solution is to model both numerical ratings and like/dislike in a principled way, using a novel framework of Transfer by Collective Factorization (TCF). In particular, we construct the shared latent space collectively and learn the data-dependent effect separately. A major advantage of the TCF approach over previous collective matrix factorization (or bifactorization) methods is that we are able to capture the data-dependent effect when sharing the data-independent knowledge, so as to increase the over-all quality of knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TCF at various sparsity levels as compared to several state-of-the-art methods."
989820,14040,10237,Effectiveness of the data generated on different time in latent factor model,2013,"User selection data accumulates as time goes by. Although the recent selections are usually assumed to have higher impact on the recommendation accuracy, empirical studies on this problem are limited. For old data, whether they can contribute to the recommendation accuracy is still to be determined. On one hand, changes in short-term user preference over time may limit their effectiveness in prediction, but on the other hand, one cannot rule out their potential in capturing long term user preferences. The result is important for the system owner to determine which data is useful to make the recommendation accurately. While there have been some related studies on the time dependency of data quality using neighbor-based CF methods (e.g., [4]), its effects remain unverified for other CF methods. In this paper, we study the effect of data generated over different time period on recommendation precision using several popular model-based CF algorithms (latent factor models). experiment results show that while more recent data expectedly have larger impacts, the usefulness of older data cannot be ignored as long as there are sufficient old samples. However, the addition of insufficient amount of old data seems to have negative impacts."
1609274,14040,9896,Identifying Seekers and Suppliers in Social Media Communities to Support Crisis Coordination,2014,"Effective crisis management has long relied on both the formal and informal response communities. Social media platforms such as Twitter increase the participation of the informal response community in crisis response. Yet, challenges remain in realizing the formal and informal response communities as a cooperative work system. We demonstrate a supportive technology that recognizes the existing capabilities of the informal response community to identify needs (seeker behavior) and provide resources (supplier behavior), using their own terminology. To facilitate awareness and the articulation of work in the formal response community, we present a technology that can bridge the differences in terminology and understanding of the task between the formal and informal response communities. This technology includes our previous work using domain-independent features of conversation to identify indications of coordination within the informal response community. In addition, it includes a domain-dependent analysis of message content (drawing from the ontology of the formal response community and patterns of language usage concerning the transfer of property) to annotate social media messages. The resulting repository of annotated messages is accessible through our social media analysis tool, Twitris. It allows recipients in the formal response community to sort on resource needs and availability along various dimensions including geography and time. Thus, computation indexes the original social media content and enables complex querying to identify contents, players, and locations. Evaluation of the computed annotations for seeker-supplier behavior with human judgment shows fair to moderate agreement. In addition to the potential benefits to the formal emergency response community regarding awareness of the observations and activities of the informal response community, the analysis serves as a point of reference for evaluating more computationally intensive efforts and characterizing the patterns of language behavior during a crisis."
2086030,14040,11317,Laevo: a temporal desktop interface for integrated knowledge work,2014,"Prior studies show that knowledge work is characterized by highly interlinked practices, including task, file and window management. However, existing personal information management tools primarily focus on a limited subset of knowledge work, forcing users to perform additional manual configuration work to integrate the different tools they use. In order to understand tool usage, we review literature on how users' activities are created and evolve over time as part of knowledge worker practices. From this we derive the activity life cycle, a conceptual framework describing the different states and transitions of an activity. The life cycle is used to inform the design of Laevo, a temporal activity-centric desktop interface for personal knowledge work. Laevo allows users to structure work within dedicated workspaces, managed on a timeline. Through a centralized notification system which doubles as a to-do list, incoming interruptions can be handled. Our field study indicates how highlighting the temporal nature of activities results in lightweight scalable activity management, while making users more aware about their ongoing and planned work."
746533,14040,11317,Paper3D: bringing casual 3D modeling to a multi-touch interface,2014,"A 3D modeling system that provides all-inclusive functionality is generally too demanding for a casual 3D modeler to learn. In recent years, there has been a shift towards developing more approachable systems, with easy-to-learn, intuitive interfaces. However, most modeling systems still employ mouse and keyboard interfaces, despite the ubiquity of tablet devices, and the benefits of multi-touch interfaces applied to 3D modeling. In this paper, we introduce an alternative 3D modeling paradigm for creating developable surfaces, inspired by traditional papercrafting, and implemented as a system designed from the start for a multi-touch tablet. We demonstrate the process of assembling complex 3D scenes from a collection of simpler models, in turn shaped through operations applied to sheets of virtual paper. The modeling and assembling operations mimic familiar, real-world operations performed on paper, allowing users to quickly learn our system with very little guidance. We outline key design decisions made throughout the development process, based on feedback obtained through collaboration with target users. Finally, we include a range of models created in our system."
764798,14040,9896,The Trouble with `Tacit Knowledge',2012,"The development and maintenance of organized cooperative work practices require, as an integral feature, what can loosely be termed `didactic practices' or `mutual learning' (giving and receiving instruction, advice, direction, guidance, recommendation, etc.). However, such didactic practices have not been investigated systematically in CSCW. Michael Polanyi's notion of `tacit knowledge' vs. `explicit knowledge', which plays a key role in the area of Knowledge Management, would seem to offer an obvious framework for investigating didactic practices in CSCW. But as argued in this article, the notion of `tacit knowledge' is a conceptual muddle that mystifies the very concept of practical knowledge. The article examines the historical context in which the notion of `tacit knowledge' was devised, the purpose for which it was formulated, its original articulation, and the perplexing ways in which it has been appropriated in Knowledge Management. In an attempt to gain firm ground for our research, the article towards the end offers a general analysis of the concept of `knowledge', informed by the work of Gilbert Ryle and Alan White. Overall, the article argues that a framework based on the notion of `tacit knowledge', or on similar conceptions devoted to categorizations of kinds of knowledge, impairs the for CSCW essential focus on actual work practices: instead of focusing on forms of symbolism, what is required is to focus on uncovering the logics of actual didactic practices in cooperative work."
1163272,14040,9896,Beyond Expertise Seeking: A Field Study of the Informal Knowledge Practices of Healthcare IT Teams,2012,"CSCW has long been concerned with formal and informal knowledge practices in organizations, examining both the social and technical aspects of how knowledge is sought, shared, and used. In this study, we are interested in examining the set of activities that occur when co-located knowledge workers manage and resolve issues by seeking, sharing, and applying their informal knowledge. Informal knowledge seeking involves more than identifying the expert who has the knowledge or accessing the knowledge through physical artifacts. It also involves working with that expert to identify and apply the appropriate knowledge to the particular situation. However, our understandings of how people collaboratively work together to find, share and apply this knowledge are less well understood. To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted a field study of how professionals in three IT teams of a regional hospital managed and resolved IT issues. These knowledge workers used various collaborative practices such as creation of ad-hoc teams and the use of email to identify, share, and use informal knowledge to resolve IT issues. In addition, particular team practices such as how issues are assigned affected these knowledge activities. Our findings highlight how informal knowledge activities are affected by a variety of implicit and sometimes subtle features of the organization and that organizational knowledge management systems should support informal knowledge seeking activities and collaboration amongst the knowledge sharers."
2082237,14040,9704,Turning Experience Products into Search Products: Making User Feedback Count,2011,"Online shopping sites are faced with a significant problem: When offering experience products, i.e., products that lack a helpful description in terms of easily accessible factual properties (e.g., wine, cigars, and movies), a lot of work and time needs to be invested to provide such information. Two very popular approaches are the introduction of sophisticated categorization systems (e.g., fruity, woody, and peppery for wines) along with manual product classification performed by experts and the addition of user feedback mechanisms (e.g., ratings or textual reviews). While user feedback typically is easy to collect, for purposes of product search, it cannot be used as easily as this is possible with a systematic categorization scheme. In this paper, we propose an effective method to automatically derive product classifications of high quality from many different kinds of user feedback. Our semi-supervised method combines advanced data extraction methods with state-of-the-art classification algorithms and only requires a small number of training examples to be created manually by experts. We prove the benefits of our approach by performing an extensive evaluation in the movie domain."
872829,14040,11317,Vermeer: direct interaction with a 360° viewable 3D display,2011,"We present Vermeer, a novel interactive 360° viewable 3D display. Like prior systems in this area, Vermeer provides viewpoint-corrected, stereoscopic 3D graphics to simultaneous users, 360° around the display, without the need for eyewear or other user instrumentation. Our goal is to over-come an issue inherent in these prior systems which - typically due to moving parts - restrict interactions to outside the display volume. Our system leverages a known optical illusion to demonstrate, for the first time, how users can reach into and directly touch 3D objects inside the display volume. Vermeer is intended to be a new enabling technology for interaction, and we therefore describe our hardware implementation in full, focusing on the challenges of combining this optical configuration with an existing approach for creating a 360° viewable 3D display. Initially we demonstrate direct involume interaction by sensing user input with a Kinect camera placed above the display. However, by exploiting the properties of the optical configuration, we also demonstrate novel prototypes for fully integrated input sensing alongside simultaneous display. We conclude by discussing limitations, implications for interaction, and ideas for future work."
1696938,14040,20561,Modal Energy Trending for Ringdown Analysis in Power Systems Using Synchrophasors,2014,"Accurate on-line estimation of power systems oscillatory modes is important for dealing with complex interactions of large interconnected power systems especially in light of growing number of wind farms with complex power electronics controls. This paper describes an automatic ringdown analysis algorithm for extracting dominant oscillatory modes in power system responses from multiple synchronized Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) measurements. The proposed approach estimates the system modes by tracking and analyzing the trend of modal oscillation energy seen in the Power Spectrum Density (PSD) of the measured ringdown response. Singular Value Decomposition of Power Spectrum Density matrix as in Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) algorithm is used to get overall energy measures for each dominant mode from multiple PMU signals in the ringdown response. This method is useful for real-time oscillation detection and analysis. The combination of frequency domain analysis and SVD enable the method to be robust under noisy conditions. The method is tested with simulation data as well as real power system archived data, and is shown to accurately extract multiple oscillatory modes and their mode shapes from system measurements."
2150426,14040,11317,Crowd-scale interactive formal reasoning and analytics,2013,"Large online courses often assign problems that are easy to grade because they have a fixed set of solutions (such as multiple choice), but grading and guiding students is more difficult in problem domains that have an unbounded number of correct answers. One such domain is derivations: sequences of logical steps commonly used in assignments for technical, mathematical and scientific subjects. We present DeduceIt, a system for creating, grading, and analyzing derivation assignments in any formal domain. DeduceIt supports assignments in any logical formalism, provides students with incremental feedback, and aggregates student paths through each proof to produce instructor analytics. DeduceIt benefits from checking thousands of derivations on the web: it introduces a proof cache, a novel data structure which leverages a crowd of students to decrease the cost of checking derivations and providing real-time, constructive feedback. We evaluate DeduceIt with 990 students in an online compilers course, finding students take advantage of its incremental feedback and instructors benefit from its structured insights into course topics. Our work suggests that automated reasoning can extend online assignments and large-scale education to many new domains."
1607317,14040,9896,Officing: Mediating Time and the Professional Self in the Support of Nomadic Work,2014,"Today’s mobile knowledge professionals use a diversity of digital technologies to perform their work. Much of this daily technology consumption involves a variety of activities of articulation, negotiation and repair to support their work as well as their nomadic practices. This article argues that these activities mediate and structure social relations, going beyond the usual attention given to this work as a support requirement of cooperative and mobile work. Drawing on cultural approaches to technology consumption, the article introduces the concept of ‘officing’ and its three main categories of connecting, configuring and synchronizing, to show how these activities shape and are shaped by the relationship that workers have with their time and sense of professional self. This argument is made through research of professionals at a municipal council in Sydney and at a global telecommunications firm with regional headquarters in Melbourne, trialling a smartphone prototype. This research found that while officing fuels a sense of persistent time pressure and collapse of work and life boundaries, it also supports new temporal and spatial senses and opportunities for maintaining professional identities."
2048675,14040,20561,Predicting Insider Threat Risks through Linguistic Analysis of Electronic Communication,2013,"Organizations face growing risks from malicious or careless insiders. An insider threat may take many forms, including disgruntled workers, individuals under financial stress or intentional acts of espionage. Waiting for threats to manifest may leave an organization open to liability, hurt morale and in extreme cases lead to physical harm of others. However, predicting who may pose the greatest risk is challenging. Legal and economic concerns make direct psychological examinations challenging, while reliance upon supervisor or co-worker assessments may lead to unfounded accusations. This research investigates the potential for active monitoring of electronic communications as a method that may identify problems early, allowing for proactive mitigation through coaching, assistance programs and where warranted, termination. Research has found correlations between word use and behavior. This research demonstrates that subtle but measurable differences in the frequency of common words found in electronic communication may provide clues about potential insider threat risks."
1009378,14040,20411,TFMAP: optimizing MAP for top-n context-aware recommendation,2012,"In this paper, we tackle the problem of top-N context-aware recommendation for implicit feedback scenarios. We frame this challenge as a ranking problem in collaborative filtering (CF). Much of the past work on CF has not focused on evaluation metrics that lead to good top-N recommendation lists in designing recommendation models. In addition, previous work on context-aware recommendation has mainly focused on explicit feedback data, i.e., ratings. We propose TFMAP, a model that directly maximizes Mean Average Precision with the aim of creating an optimally ranked list of items for individual users under a given context. TFMAP uses tensor factorization to model implicit feedback data (e.g., purchases, clicks) with contextual information.   The optimization of MAP in a large data collection is computationally too complex to be tractable in practice. To address this computational bottleneck, we present a fast learning algorithm that exploits several intrinsic properties of average precision to improve the learning efficiency of TFMAP, and to ensure its scalability. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed fast learning algorithm, and demonstrate that TFMAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation approaches."
165373,14040,21989,Study and Evaluation of Separability Techniques and Occlusion in Multitouch Surfaces,2014,"Multitouch interfaces allow interacting with a virtual object directly, similar to a real object. However, there are several issues to be resolved, such as the accuracy of the manipulation, the occlusion, the separability of the manipulation, etc. Multitouch interfaces allow multiple spatial transformations that can be performed on a virtual object with only a gesture. For example, an object can be rotated, translated and scaled with two fingers with a single gesture. However, some unwanted movements may occur accidentally. Separability techniques appear with the intent to prevent unwanted movements on multitouch surfaces. Occlusion is another problem that occurs in multitouch interfaces. Often the user's hand hides the vision of the object with which he/she interacts; or the user's action on interface hinders the movement when it clicks on a bottom that triggers action. This paper proposes two techniques of separability, aiming to reduce the problems that arise due to excessive freedom of manipulation in multi-touch interfaces, and evaluates the efficiency of these techniques. The techniques developed are not only applicable in simple virtual objects; they are also for WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer) objects, aiming to reduce occlusion. A series of tests was performed to evaluate precision, occlusion time for completion of task, and ease of use."

1541359,14040,20561,Secure and Reliable Distributed Health Records: Achieving Query Assurance across Repositories of Encrypted Health Data,2012,"Future health information system architectures will intrinsically include distributed systems and data repositories across multiple organizations. As such it will become more important to provide a high level of query quality assurance for the organizations utilizing these distributed and shared data repositories. Query assurance is defined as the data source accurately responding to queries by meeting the requirements of correctness, completeness and freshness. Secure and private health information is a necessity and as one of the significant threats to this security is from insider activities, it will often be desirable that electronic health information be stored in an encrypted format to provide data confidentiality. Providing data confidentially and query assurance within the same approach will be a necessity, while simultaneously ensuring the usability of the health information is not substantially diminished. In this paper, we present a query assurance model that implements the three requirements of query assurance across sources of searchable encrypted data. Further, we consider the issue of freshness and data persistence in a multiple data-owner environment. This is a novel contribution to query assurance and one driven by and increasingly important in the specific context of emerging distributed health information systems. The approach is tested against a large dataset of Continuity of Care Records (CCR) in a key-value store and evaluation results are presented."
1709579,14040,20854,Human actions made tangible: analysing the temporal organization of activities,2014,"With designers increasingly moving beyond button pushing and flat-screen interaction towards tangible and embodied interaction, techniques for user studies need to develop as well. While ethnographic video studies and ethnomethod-ological analyses are becoming standard in many interaction design projects, it remains a challenge to investigate in detail how people interact with all of their body. Analysis of full-body movement is time consuming, notation techniques are rare, and findings are difficult to share between members of a design team. In this paper we propose tangible video analysis, a method developed to engage people from different backgrounds in collaboratively analysing videos with the help of physical objects. We will present one of these tools, Action Scrabble, for analysing temporal organisation of human actions. We work with a case of skilled forklift truck driving. By backtracking our design research experiments, we will unfold how and why the tangible tool succeeds in engaging designers with varied analysis experience to collaboratively focus on human action structures -- and even find video analysis fun!"
149861,14040,22113,GBPR: group preference based Bayesian personalized ranking for one-class collaborative filtering,2013,"One-class collaborative filtering or collaborative ranking with implicit feedback has been steadily receiving more attention, mostly due to the one-class characteristics of data in various services, e.g., like in Facebook and bought in Amazon. Previous works for solving this problem include pointwise regression methods based on absolute rating assumptions and pairwise ranking methods with relative score assumptions, where the latter was empirically found performing much better because it models users' ranking-related preferences more directly. However, the two fundamental assumptions made in the pairwise ranking methods, (1) individual pairwise preference over two items and (2) independence between two users, may not always hold. As a response, we propose a new and improved assumption, group Bayesian personalized ranking (GBPR), via introducing richer interactions among users. In particular, we introduce group preference, to relax the aforementioned individual and independence assumptions. We then design a novel algorithm correspondingly, which can recommend items more accurately as shown by various ranking-oriented evaluation metrics on four real-world datasets in our experiments."
2669893,14040,20332,Computing randomized security strategies in networked domains,2011,"Traditionally, security decisions have been made without explicitly accounting for adaptive, intelligent attackers. Recent game theoretic security models have explicitly included attacker response in computing randomized security policies. Techniques to date, however, generally fail to explicitly account for interdependence between the targets to be secured, which is of vital importance in a variety of domains, including cyber, supply chain, and critical infrastructure security. We introduce a novel framework for computing optimal randomized security policies in networked domains which extends previous approaches in two ways. First, we extend previous linear programming techniques for Stackelberg security games to incorporate benefits and costs of arbitrary security configurations on individual assets. Second, we offer a principled model of failure cascades that allows us to capture both the direct and indirect value of assets. Finally, we use our framework to analyze four models, two based on random graph generation models, a simple model of interdependence between critical infrastructure and key resource sectors, and a model of the Fedwire interbank payment network."
1718602,14040,20561,"From Traditional, to Lean, to Agile Development: Finding the Optimal Software Engineering Cycle",2013,"In 2008, our team at NASA Ames Research Center launched a five-year project to deliver a user-centric software platform for mission control. We began with a six-month delivery cycle. Within two years we were delivering functional software every three weeks. Our evolution from traditional, to lean, then agile, did not happen because of a focused goal to become lean or agile. Rather, we responded iteratively to problems, we were disconnected from our customer, the long delivery cycles created issues with testing and verification, and we were unable to effectively measure our progress. We changed our delivery cycle first to six weeks, then three, with the team focused on the highest-priority features and bug fixes. Our one measure of progress became working code. We delivered a nightly build to our customer. Our QA team tested features as they rolled out. In our journey from traditional to agile, we tailored our processes to our team culture and our context of work. We found that agile methods increased customer and team satisfaction, and enabled us to use limited team resources where they were most effective -- the design and development of the software."
835609,14040,20561,ICT for Governance and Policy Modelling: Research Challenges and Future Prospects in Europe,2012,"As the role of government in the society is undergoing continuous change, consensus is starting to build around the potential that collaborative technologies have in the field of governance and policy modeling. For effective citizen empowerment and participation to become mainstream, at a greater scale, several challenges will have to be faced, which will require new tools to be developed. The research questions underlying the present paper are: which new ICT-enabled governance models and methods of monitoring, interaction, collaboration for policy making and enforcement are emerging, and which policy modelling mechanisms can be implemented in order to effectively involve citizens in decision making? The paper starts addressing these issues by defining the problem statement and discussing the changing role of the government in the Information Society, also proposing some elements for a conceptualisation of ICT for governance and policy modelling. It further presents the evolving debate on the e-Government and e-Governance agenda developments, as well as the state of the art and the limitations of research in these fields. Main emerging trends and future prospects within the evolving public sector are then anticipated in order to draw some preliminary conclusions outlining the challenges ahead and future research in the field of ICT for governance and policy modelling."
1282033,14040,10237,"Beyond friendship: the art, science and applications of recommending people to people in social networks",2013,"While Recommender Systems are powerful drivers of engagement and transactional utility in social networks, People recommenders are a fairly involved and diverse subdomain. Consider that movies are recommended to be watched, news is recommended to be read, people however, are recommended for a plethora of reasons -- such as recommendation of people to befriend, follow, partner, targets for an advertisement or service, recruiting, partnering romantically and to join thematic interest groups.   This tutorial aims to first describe the problem domain, touch upon classical approaches like link analysis and collaborative filtering and then take a rapid deep dive into the unique aspects of this problem space like reciprocity, intent understanding of recommender and the recomendee, contextual people recommendations in communication flows and social referrals -- a paradigm for delivery of recommendations using the social graph. These aspects will be discussed in the context of published original work developed by the authors and their collaborators and in many cases deployed in massive-scale real world applications on professional networks such as LinkedIn."
1440802,14040,9896,The Management and Use of Social Network Sites in a Government Department,2012,"In this paper we report findings from a study of social network site use in a UK Government department. We have investigated this from a managerial, organisational perspective. We found at the study site that there are already several social network technologies in use, and that these: misalign with and problematize organisational boundaries; blur boundaries between working and social lives; present differing opportunities for control; have different visibilities; have overlapping functionality with each other and with other information technologies; that they evolve and change over time; and that their uptake is conditioned by existing infrastructure and availability. We find the organisational complexity that social technologies are often hoped to cut across is, in reality, something that shapes their uptake and use. We argue the idea of a single, central social network site for supporting cooperative work within an organisation will hit the same problems as any effort of centralisation in organisations. Fostering collective intelligence in organisations is therefore not a problem of designing the right technology but of supporting work across multiple technologies. We argue that while there is still plenty of scope for design and innovation in this area, an important challenge now is in supporting organisations in managing what can best be referred to as a social network site `ecosystem'."
969989,14040,20561,Enabling Patient Information Handoff from Pre-hospital Transport Providers to Hospital Emergency Departments: Design-Science Approach to Field Testing,2014,"The transfer of complete patient information between EMS personnel and hospitals ED staff is a major challenge in emergency medical care. This study used a design science methodology to design, demonstrate in use, and field test a mobile and web based EMS software solution that provides textual and multimedia information for emergency responses. The system was field tested for a period of three months in rural Minnesota. A mixed method approach was employed to assess the system use and perceptions of value in patient handoff. Data was drawn from system log files over a 3-month period and in-depth interviews conducted at the end of the study with an equal number of representatives from EMS personnel and ED staff. Findings suggest the use of mobile and web based EMS solutions may be more appropriate in rural settings with long transport times and for more sever incidents - where participants found value in the use of information for patient pre-registrations and early notifications. A systematic longer-term testing of clinical use of the system is suggested as the next step in further demonstrating the value of such a mobile solution."
1687174,14040,9099,Personalized video recommendation through tripartite graph propagation,2012,"The rapid growth of the number of videos on the Internet provides enormous potential for users to find content of interest to them. Video search, such as Google, Youtube, Bing, is a popular way to help users to find desired videos. However, it is still very challenging to discover new video contents for users. In this paper, we address the problem of providing personalized video suggestions for users. Rather than only exploring the user-video graph that is formulated using the click-through information, we also investigate other two useful graphs, the user-query graph indicating if a user ever issues a query, and the query-video graph indicating if a video appears in the search result of a query. The two graphs act as a bridge to connect users and videos, and have a large potential to improve the recommendation as the queries issued by a user essentially imply his interest. As a result, we reach a tripartite graph over (user, video, query). We develop an iterative propagation scheme over the tripartite graph to compute the preference information of each user. Experimental results on a dataset of 2,893 users, 23,630 queries and 55,114 videos collected during Feb. 1-28, 2011 demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, co-views and random walks on the user-video bipartite graph."
1051709,14040,20796,What is happening right now ... that interests me?: online topic discovery and recommendation in twitter,2012,"Users engaged in the Social Web increasingly rely upon continuous streams of Twitter messages ( tweets ) for real-time access to information and fresh knowledge about current affairs. However, given the deluge of tweets, it is a challenge for individuals to find relevant and appropriately ranked information. We propose to address this knowledge management problem by going beyond the general perspective of information finding in Twitter, that asks: What is happening right now?, towards an individual user perspective, and ask: What is interesting to  me  right now? In this paper, we consider collaborative filtering as an online ranking problem and present RMFO, a method that creates, in real-time, user-specific rankings for a set of tweets based on individual preferences that are inferred from the user's past system interactions. Experiments on the  476 million Twitter tweets  dataset show that our online approach largely outperforms recommendations based on Twitter's  global trend  and Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF), a highly competitive state-of-the-art Collaborative Filtering technique, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach."
195656,14040,21989,A Service Design Framework for Manufacturing Enterprises toward Product Service System,2014,"Manufacturing enterprises have been recently trying to create new value through a strategic alternative such as Product Service System because of the limitation of product growth, the keen competition of price and so on. Man- ufacturing enterprises have many risks to extend their business field over their core ability, with not enough the service domain knowledge, human resources and investment costs. This study suggested the framework that is needed for manufacturing enterprises to penetrate into a service business domain. Manufacturing companies are creating a considerable portion of the added value on entire business from service, and the paradigm is changing into providing service rather than providing products. The Product Service System was introduced due to the factors of growth limit of manufacturing business, intensified price competition, and sudden rise of the late-starting nations of low production cost, including China. Due to such factors, the necessity of differentiating with a single solution of combined product and service is being magnified when providing a single product. This study intends to suggest a framework providing a strategic plan that can be selected in each step of the entire service process when manufacturing businesses are trying to carry forward a Product Service System when they are not equipped with core competence of the service business."
725625,14040,20561,On the Relevance of the Modularity Concept for Understanding Outsourcing Risk Factors,2014,"Contemporary organizations frequently seek external and specialized partners to outsource some of their non-core, though highly complex tasks, including their information systems. In literature, a variety of outsourcing risk factors which lead to unsuccessful project outcomes have been identified. Despite many remedies suggested by practitioners and scholars to mitigate these risk factors, empirical studies continue to report frequent failures in outsourcing projects. This paper suggests an alternative perspective to analyze risks related to outsourcing projects, based on the concept of modularity. Such a new perspective can help in complementing existing outsourcing risk analyses with new or deeper insights as a basis to define a more exhaustive list of required mitigating actions, which in turn could lead to more succesful outsourcing projects. To illustrate this alternative perspective, a reanalysis of a failed outsourcing case is discussed. The paper shows in a detailed way how poorly designed modular structures at the technical and project level could have been identified ex-ante. This identification may explain the manifestation of ex-post outsourcing risk factors such as 'lack of required skills', 'managing user expectation' and 'communication problems'."
78713,14040,21989,Mobile App Support for Electric Vehicle Drivers: A Review of Today’s Marketplace and Future Directions,2013,"Mobile device applications (apps) are becoming an important source of information, control, and motivation for EV drivers. Here we review the current ecosystem of mobile applications that are available for EV drivers and consumers and find that apps are available in six basic categories: purchase de- cisions, vehicle dashboards, charging availability and payment, smart grid inte- raction, route planning, and driver competitions. The current range of the EV- specific mobile marketplace extends from pre-sale consumer information, charging information and control, and EV specific navigation features among other services. However, the market is highly fragmented, with applications providing niche information, and using various methodologies. In addition, we find that the barriers to more useful apps are a lack of vehicle and charger APIs (application programming interfaces), lack of data availability, reliability, for- mat and types, and proprietary payment and billing methods. We conclude that mobile applications for EVs are a growing market that provide important direct benefits as well as ancillary services to EV owners, although the lack of un- iformity and standards between both vehicle and charger systems is a serious barrier to the broader use of mobile applications for EVs."
1705290,14040,9896,Nomadicity and the care of place:on the aesthetic and affective organization of space in freelance creative work,2014,"While information and communication technology enables freelancers to work “anytime anywhere”, it has become apparent that not all places seem to be equally suitable for their work. Drawing from CSCW literature on the practical accomplishment of mobile work and theoretical literature on creativity, insights from ethnographic studies in New York, Berlin and Wiesbaden are discussed. The paper follows workers in their everyday attempts to seek out and enact work environments, which enable them to be creative and productive. In these processes, mobility features both as a problem and a resource. The search for the right place makes these workers restless, but sometimes restlessness and nomadicity can inspire creativity. Similarly, new mobile, social and collaborative technologies allow a new balancing of solitude and sociality. I call this emerging nexus of practices which entails aesthetic, affective, social and socio-political dimensions the care of place. A conjoint theoretical and empirical analysis aims to draw attention to everyday lived practices of nomadicity and the care of place in a wider discursive and socio-political context to inform CSCW design."
2246500,14040,20561,The Seven Layer Model of Collaboration: An Exploratory Study of Process Identification and Improvement,2012,"In preparing for conflict, the US military must make complex decisions based on a vast amount of information in as quickly and efficiently as possible. The Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) has been developed to structure the efforts of a combat unit as they decide how to best implement the orders of a higher command. The process is highly collaborative, as staff officers assemble information necessary for the mission, conduct scenario analyses (war-games), and select and implement. Collaboration Engineers attended a week-long MDMP training camp to analyze the MDMP for opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes. To identify processes of improvement, the engineers used the Seven Layer Model of Collaboration (SLMC) which aids in the identification of the goals, deliverables, activities, patterns of collaboration, techniques, actions, and technologies associated with each process. We report in this study some of the more promising improvement opportunities found using the SLMC. We also report on some classes of problems observable across work practices within the MDMP, which may likely extend to other work practices. We end with a discussion of these classes and opportunities for future research."
1371388,14040,23757,Personalized paper recommendation in online social scholar system,2014,"This paper presents a practical paper recommender system, which aims to provide personalized research paper recommendations to users within an online social scholar system. As an online recommender system, there are three basic problems we need to tackle: 1) How to formalize and solve the recommendation problem; 2) How to achieve real time recommendation; and 3) How to interact with users. In our work, we take the personalized paper recommendation as a ranking problem with respect to users' research interests, and employ a supervised learning to rank approach to solve the problem. However, most previous learning to rank methods rely on manually labeled training data which are both expensive and limited in size. We propose automatical training data construction by mining the existing large scale academic network, and extract various heterogeneous features for learning. With the learned model, we conduct real time personalized recommendation based on our novel efficient candidate generation approach. In addition, update recommendation is employed to interact with users according to different types of user feedbacks. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by both offline and online evaluation."
938588,14040,20561,Introduction to the communication and information systems technology for emergency management minitrack,2013,"The world spends annually between 16 and 23 billion US dollars in disaster assistance. In 2010 an estimated 373 natural disasters occurred, causing 296, 800 victims and affecting more than 207 million people. By 2050 the number of people living in areas especially prone to natural disasters will probably double (from 680 to 1500 million). Communication and Information System Technology is profoundly changing the management of disasters and emergencies. Mobile devices and social media are being used by citizens in innovative ways to help them manage the consequences of disasters for themselves, families, and communities. The trend of increasing traffic flow originating from affected citizens poses many research challenges. This minitrack, which is 'new' in that it was established in Spring 2012, attracted a satisfactory number of submissions from which eight were selected to be presented at the conference. The first session of four papers deals with data collection to aid better management. The second session comprises papers about lessons learned, decision support and evacuation modeling."
1170350,14040,20561,IT Investments and Firm Stock Market Value: The Mediating Role of Stock Analysts,2014,"This study provides a new perspective to the long-standing debate on the business value of IT. Prior research on IT value takes an internal perspective - focusing on business processes and complementary resources that help create value form IT investments. In this study, we take an external perspective - focusing on the value discovery role of stock analysts. Stock analysts collect information about firms' IT investments and provide informed recommendations to investors in the financial market. Research in finance has long shown that stock analysts can reduce information asymmetry between the firm and investors. However, despite that IT investments are known for their complexity and inherent risks, little is known about the role of stock analysts in helping the financial market understand firms' investments in IT. We address this question empirically using IT assets and firm performance data of Fortune 1000 firms between 1996 and 2007. Our empirical evidence suggests that stock analysts play an intricate mediating role in the stock market evaluation of IT investments. Analyst recommendations have a stronger mediating role in the effects of enterprise IT systems (ERP and CRM) on firm market value, but a weaker and insignificant mediating role in the effects of function IT systems (DSS, HR and AIS). In addition, we find that the mediating role of financial analysts for IT investments is more salient when the firm's market environments are more uncertain and unpredictable. These findings suggest that financial analysts play a critical role in the market valuation of firms' IT investments."
1741151,14040,20561,Cultural Differences in Playing Repeated Ultimatum Game Online with Virtual Humans,2014,Efficient interaction between computational agents and users in tasks such as negotiation and bargaining requires recognition and understanding of potential differences in human behavior. Cultural differences in humans bargaining behavior are the focus of this study. We investigate the dynamics of human game playing with a conversational computational agent (Virtual Human). We demonstrate that the cultural background influences their observed behavior in this task. We investigate whether the social values held by the participants from each culture can at least partially explain the observed differences in behavior. We show that it is possible to automatically identify players' cultures from their game behavior and to predict their upcoming decisions in different stages of a repeated game. We employ data collected from US and Indian participants playing repeated rounds of the Ultimatum Game online against a virtual human when low stakes are involved. Our results are comparable to the reported results of similar games played among people in laboratory conditions and with high stakes. The two cultures are different in terms of the statistics and the sequence of offers made in the game and their reported values. The findings of this study are valuable for development of culturally-sensitive computational agents for negotiation and bargaining.
2332019,14040,20561,"Every Post You Make, Every Pic You Take, I'll Be Watching You: Behind Social Spheres on Facebook",2012,"The problem of conflicting social spheres occurs when communications are simultaneously visible to multiple audiences within a social network, as commonly occurs on social network sites (SNS). In this environment users may suffer from social anxiety as they worry that communications seen as negative by certain audiences may be shared with those same groups. This issue rests on four assumptions: (1) that a social network encompasses a variety of social spheres, (2) that users believe they are being watched by these spheres, (3) that the social spheres differ in the norms, standards and expectations they hold about an individual and (4) that users largely do not employ measures to separate communications to different spheres. The present research aims to provide evidence for these assumptions. Self-discrepancy theory (SDT) [1] is used as a lens to view social norms, and as a novel way of understanding social spheres. Moreover, the research investigates any link between the magnitude of ought self-discrepancies and the social anxiety felt between relational dyads. An online survey with 313 participants offers strong support for these assumptions and provides evidence of a significant association between the magnitude of negative ought-other discrepancies and anxiety within dyads. This evidence strengthens the argument that SNS can cause anxiety and tension in social relations."
1075311,14040,8927,Personalized entity recommendation: a heterogeneous information network approach,2014,"Among different hybrid recommendation techniques, network-based entity recommendation methods, which utilize user or item relationship information, are beginning to attract increasing attention recently. Most of the previous studies in this category only consider a single relationship type, such as friendships in a social network. In many scenarios, the entity recommendation problem exists in a  heterogeneous information network  environment. Different types of relationships can be potentially used to improve the recommendation quality. In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. Specifically, we propose to combine heterogeneous relationship information for each user differently and aim to provide high-quality personalized recommendation results using user implicit feedback data and personalized recommendation models.   In order to take full advantage of the relationship heterogeneity in information networks, we first introduce meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different types of paths. We then define recommendation models at both global and personalized levels and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the proposed models. Empirical studies show that our approaches outperform several widely employed or the state-of-the-art entity recommendation techniques."
2155363,14040,20358,Analyzing the suitability of web applications for a single-user to multi-user transformation,2013,"Multi-user web applications like Google Docs or Etherpad are crucial to efficiently support collaborative work (e.g. jointly create texts, graphics, or presentations). Nevertheless, enhancing single-user web applications with multi-user capabilities (i.e. document synchronization and conflict resolution) is a time-consuming and intricate task since traditional approaches adopting concurrency control libraries (e.g. Apache Wave) require numerous scattered source code changes. Therefore, we devised the Generic Collaboration Infrastructure (GCI) [8] that is capable of converting single-user web applications non-invasively into collaborative ones, i.e. no source code changes are required. In this paper, we present a catalog of vital application properties that allows determining if a web application is suitable for a GCI transformation. On the basis of the introduced catalog, we analyze 12 single-user web applications and show that 6 are eligible for a GCI transformation. Moreover, we demonstrate (1) the transformation of one qualified application, namely, the prominent text editor TinyMCE, and (2) showcase the resulting multi-user capabilities. Both demo parts are illustrated in a dedicated screencast that is available at http://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/demo/TinyMCE/."
2399479,14040,20411,Addressing cold start in recommender systems: a semi-supervised co-training algorithm,2014,"Cold start is one of the most challenging problems in recommender systems. In this paper we tackle the cold-start problem by proposing a context-aware semi-supervised co-training method named CSEL. Specifically, we use a factorization model to capture fine-grained user-item context. Then, in order to build a model that is able to boost the recommendation performance by leveraging the context, we propose a semi-supervised ensemble learning algorithm. The algorithm constructs different (weak) prediction models using examples with different contexts and then employs the co-training strategy to allow each (weak) prediction model to learn from the other prediction models. The method has several distinguished advantages over the standard recommendation methods for addressing the cold-start problem. First, it defines a fine-grained context that is more accurate for modeling the user-item preference. Second, the method can naturally support supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, which provides a flexible way to incorporate the unlabeled data.   The proposed algorithms are evaluated on two real-world datasets. The experimental results show that with our method the recommendation accuracy is significantly improved compared to the standard algorithms and the cold-start problem is largely alleviated."
1351140,14040,20411,Your neighbors affect your ratings: on geographical neighborhood influence to rating prediction,2014,"Rating prediction is to predict the preference rating of a user to an item that she has not rated before. Using the business review data from Yelp, in this paper, we study business rating prediction. A business here can be a restaurant, a shopping mall or other kind of businesses. Different from most other types of items that have been studied in various recommender systems (e.g., movie, song, book), a business physically exists at a geographical location, and most businesses have geographical neighbors within walking distance. When a user visits a business, there is a good chance that she walks by its neighbors. Through data analysis, we observe that there exists weak positive correlation between a business's ratings and its neighbors' ratings, regardless of the categories of businesses. Based on this observation, we assume that a user's rating to a business is determined by both the intrinsic characteristics of the business and the extrinsic characteristics of its geographical neighbors. Using the widely adopted latent factor model for rating prediction, in our proposed solution, we use two kinds of latent factors to model a business: one for its intrinsic characteristics and the other for its extrinsic characteristics. The latter encodes the neighborhood influence of this business to its geographical neighbors. In our experiments, we show that by incorporating geographical neighborhood influences, much lower prediction error is achieved than the state-of-the-art models including Biased MF, SVD++, and Social MF. The prediction error is further reduced by incorporating influences from business category and review content."
946373,14040,20854,StoryStorm: a collaborative exchange of methods for storytelling,2014,"The very act of communication is fundamentally an act of storytelling and so the stories we fashion about ourselves to make sense of our life experiences are intrinsically linked to our identity, nation, and sense of self [1], shaping our understanding of the world. Narrative and storytelling are as critical in today's society as at any other time in history. We see aspects of storytelling frequently appear in research, from development and design processes to new ideas, products and services. In these fields storytelling takes many guises, and, we argue, is often employed unconsciously. This workshop will take stock of existing storytelling processes and forms, and explore emerging digital means of capturing and sharing stories, as a methodological tool for addressing overarching empirical and collaborative interests of the DIS community. The workshop aims to bring together fields of design, HCI, ethnography and industry practitioners to understand and map the range of storytelling tools adopted during research processes, prototyping, and production; exploring how these processes are situated in a design lexicon. This will in turn initiate development of visual aids that distill and encode these practices for use in academia and beyond."
689968,14040,20561,Practices to Improve Group Creativity: A Longitudinal Field Investigation,2012,"Emergent teams are ad hoc part-time teams of strangers with very different perspectives who are asked by their company to come together and solve novel strategic problems. Most research on creativity has focused on individuals, with relatively little research on practices to improve group creativity. In this study we build upon our earlier qualitative research and longitudinally surveyed members of 31 different teams varying in the level of emergence. At three points in time, we asked team members about the practices they used to manage their creative process, focusing particularly on two practices: maintaining engagement, and co-creating shared boundary objects. We found that, these practices affected the customer's assessment of the team's innovativeness, but the timing of when these practices were introduced was critical. Implications for design of information systems includes 1) allowing members to maintain their engagement with the team's process even as they leave to attend to other activities and then rejoin the team, and 2) facilitate the co-creation of shared boundary objects early in the team's process. For managers, this research suggests the need to train team members in these two practices in order to further the innovative process."
965436,14040,369,Distributed Receive Beamforming: A Scalable Architecture and Its Proof of Concept,2013,"We propose and demonstrate a scalable architecture for distributed receive beamforming. In a receive cluster of N + 1 nodes receiving a message from a distant transmitter, N nodes are designated as amplify-and-forward relays and one node is designated as the receiver. The relay nodes apply a phase shift to their received signal and forward it such that their forwarded signals add up constructively at the receiver, with received SNR scaling linearly with N. This approach transforms a distributed receive beamforming problem on the long link from transmitter to receive cluster into a distributed transmit beamforming problem on the short link from relays to receiver, so that the number of degrees of freedom on the short link need not scale with N. A key simplification relative to distributed transmit beamforming is that, for stable oscillators, relay frequency synchronization is not required. For oscillators with drift, we provide a simple rule of thumb for when explicit frequency synchronization can be avoided. Explicit timing alignment can also be avoided by exploiting the timing of the message received on the long link. That leaves the problem of phase adjustment at the relays, and we employ an algorithm originally invented for distributed transmit beamforming for this purpose, using one bit (per iteration) feedback from the receiver. Experimental results with software-defined radios (whose oscillators have significant drift) demonstrate that the expected gains in received signal strength are obtained with the proposed architecture."
1699340,14040,9475,Convexification of Generalized Network Flow problem with application to power systems,2013,"This paper is concerned with the minimum-cost flow problem over an arbitrary flow network. In this problem, each node is associated with some possibly unknown injection, each line has two unknown flows at its ends related to each other via a nonlinear function, and all injections and flows need to satisfy certain box constraints. This problem, named generalized network flow (GNF), is highly non-convex due to its nonlinear equality constraints. Under the practical assumption of monotonicity and convexity of the flow and cost functions, a convex relaxation is proposed, which always finds the optimal injections. This relaxation may fail to find optimal flows because the mapping from injections to flows might lead to an exponential number of solutions. However, once optimal injections are found in polynomial time, other techniques can be used to find a feasible set of flows corresponding to the injections. A primary application of this work is in optimization over power networks. Recent work on the optimal power flow (OPF) problem has shown that this non-convex problem can be solved efficiently using semidefinite programming (SDP) after two approximations: relaxing angle constraints (by adding virtual phase shifters) and relaxing power balance equations to inequality constraints. The results of this work prove two facts for the OPF problem: (i) the second approximation (on balance equations) is not needed in practice under a very mild angle assumption, and (ii) if the SDP relaxation fails to find a rank-one solution, the optimal injections (and not flows) may still be recovered from an undesirable high-rank solution."
839698,14040,8228,Effect of altruism and punishment on selfish behavior for cooperation in Vehicular Networks,2012,Packet forwarding in Vehicular Networks is gathering a booming interest in research area as cooperation of nodes becomes important for such a scenario. The presence of selfish nodes reluctant to transfer data packets are the most critical concern in packet forwarding. From explanations of game theory this is a social dilemma situation that gives a suboptimal outcome from a collective standpoint. Strategic solutions can be applied to these situations to enhance cooperation in repeated interactions. This paper addresses this as Public Goods game social dilemma and applies conditional Tit-for-Tat (TFT) and unconditional altruism strategies to enhance cooperation among nodes. A packet forwarding game model is developed to apply the strategic solutions. The model also implements punishment as a motivation for selfish nodes to cooperate. Simulation results support the framework to analyze the efficiency.
1597409,14040,8839,Poster -- SAfeDJ community: situation-aware in-car music delivery for safe driving,2014,"Driving is an integral part of our everyday lives, but it is also a time when people are uniquely vulnerable. Poor road condition, traffic congestion and long driving time may bring negative emotion to drivers and increase the chance of traffic accidents. We propose SAfeDJ, a situation-aware in-car music delivery application, which turns people's trips into pleasant journeys and driving into a safe and enjoyable activity. SAfeDJ aims at helping drivers to diminish fatigue and negative emotion. It is built on a vehicular healthcare platform that enables communications among drivers and integrates with multiple types of sensors to promote safe driving. Prototype implementation and initial results of SAfeDJ have demonstrated its desired functionality in drivers' daily lives and feasibility for real-world deployment."
1660980,14040,369,Cost-Effective and Feasible Handoff Application for Mobile Phones,2012,"Heterogeneous networks with different wireless technologies increase the availability of Internet services (i.e., cloud services). However, latest mobile phones with at least two interfaces only access these services either via WiFi or UMTS/HSPA. From user's view, an optimal use of heterogeneous networks with today's mobile phones includes seamless data transmission using vertical handoff (VHO) solutions. Caused by high technical and economic costs there exist no usable solutions for readily seamless data transfers. To benefit earlier from seamless service provisioning, we present a feasible client based handoff management solution for mobile phones (CSH-MU) with embedded vertical handoff decision algorithm (VHDA) that considers mobile device's power consumption for WiFi and UMTS communication. As proof of concept and for performance evaluation, a prototype is tested on different mobile phones in a real test bed for TCP and UDP based applications. The results show that the proposed solution is not only a feasible, but also a readily usable solution for mobile phones as well as outperforms network based solutions in terms of handoff delay. A further advantage is the costeffective and immediate integration in current mobile phones without requiring any changes in the used wireless network technologies (e.g., UMTS, WiFi)."
1044602,14040,9099,A tool for automatic cinemagraphs,2012,"A cinemagraph is a new type of medium that infuses a static image with the dynamics of one or a few particular regions. It is in many ways intermediate between a photograph and a video, and provides a simple, yet expressive way to mix static and dynamic elements from a video clip. However, the process of creating cinemagraphs is usually tedious for end users and requires serious photo editing skills. In this demonstration we show a tool that creates cinemagraphs in a fully automatic manner. The technique should enable new features such as intelligent cinemagraph mode for digital cameras that provides an alternative method to capture the moment."
1192254,14040,422,A cost-effective recommender system for taxi drivers,2014,"The GPS technology and new forms of urban geography have changed the paradigm for mobile services. As such, the abundant availability of GPS traces has enabled new ways of doing taxi business. Indeed, recent efforts have been made on developing mobile recommender systems for taxi drivers using Taxi GPS traces. These systems can recommend a sequence of pick-up points for the purpose of maximizing the probability of identifying a customer with the shortest driving distance. However, in the real world, the income of taxi drivers is strongly correlated with the effective driving hours. In other words, it is more critical for taxi drivers to know the actual driving routes to minimize the driving time before finding a customer. To this end, in this paper, we propose to develop a cost-effective recommender system for taxi drivers. The design goal is to maximize their profits when following the recommended routes for finding passengers. Specifically, we first design a net profit objective function for evaluating the potential profits of the driving routes. Then, we develop a graph representation of road networks by mining the historical taxi GPS traces and provide a Brute-Force strategy to generate optimal driving route for recommendation. However, a critical challenge along this line is the high computational cost of the graph based approach. Therefore, we develop a novel recursion strategy based on the special form of the net profit function for searching optimal candidate routes efficiently. Particularly, instead of recommending a sequence of pick-up points and letting the driver decide how to get to those points, our recommender system is capable of providing an entire driving route, and the drivers are able to find a customer for the largest potential profit by following the recommendations. This makes our recommender system more practical and profitable than other existing recommender systems. Finally, we carry out extensive experiments on a real-world data set collected from the San Francisco Bay area and the experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed recommender system."
887989,14040,8806,Optimistic access control for distributed collaborative editors,2011,"The importance of collaborative systems in real-world applications has grown significantly over the recent years. The majority of new applications are designed in a distributed fashion to meet collaborative work requirements. Among these applications, we focus on Distributed Collaborative Editors (DCE) that provide computer support for modifying simultaneously shared documents, such as articles, wiki pages and programming source code by dispersed users. Although such applications are more and more used into many fields, the lack of an adequate access control concept is still limiting their full potential. In fact, controlling access in a decentralized fashion for such systems is still a challenging problem, as they need dynamic access changes and low latency access to shared documents. In this paper, we propose a generic Multi-Administrator Access Control (MAAC) based on replicating the shared document and its authorization policy at the local memory of each user. We consider the propagation of authorizations and their interactions. We propose a generic approach to enforce access control in existing collaborative editing solutions. Finally, we apply our framework on a collaboration prototype and measure its performance in the distributed grid GRID5000 to highlight the scalability of our solution."
2474555,14040,9896,Participation in an online mathematics community: differentiating motivations to add,2012,"Why do people contribute content to communities of question-answering, such as Yahoo! Answers? We investigated this issue on MathOverflow, a site dedicated to research-level mathematics, in which users ask and answer questions. MathOverflow is the first in a growing number of specialized Q&A sites using the Stack Exchange platform for scientific collaboration. In this study we combine responses to a survey with collected data on posting behavior on the site. User behavior suggests that building reputation is an important incentive, even though users do not report this in the survey. Level of expertise affects users' reported motivation to help others, but does not affect the importance of reputation building. We discuss the implications for the design of communities to target and encourage more contributions."

2597048,14040,9438,a DSL for corporate wiki initialization,2011,"Some wikis support virtual communities that are built around the wiki itself (e.g., Wikipedia). By contrast, corporate wikis are not created in a vacuum since the community already exists. Documentation, organigrams, etc are all there by the time the wiki is created. The wiki should then be tuned to the existing information ecosystem. That is, wiki concerns (e.g., categories, permissions) are to be influenced by the corporate settings. So far, all wikis are created equal: empty. This paper advocates for corporate wikis to be initialized with a wiki scaffolding: a wiki installation where some categories, permissions, etc, are initialized to mimic the corporate settings. Such scaffolding is specified in terms of a Domain Specific Language (DSL). The DSL engine is then able to turn the DSL expression into a MediaWiki installation which is ready to be populated but now, along the company settings. The DSL is provided as a FreeMind plugin, and DSL expressions are denoted as mindmaps."

In contrast to professional installable IDEs, current web-based code editors are simple text editors with extra features. They usually understand lexical syntax and can do highlighting and indenting, but lack many of the features seen in modern desktop editors. In this paper, we present CoRED, a browser-based collaborative real-time code editor for Java applications. CoRED is a complete Java editor with error checking and automatic code generation capabilities, extended with some features commonly associated with social media. As a proof of the concept, we have extended CoRED to support Java based Vaadin framework for web applications. Moreover, CoRED can be used either as a stand-alone version or as a component of any other software. It is already used as a part of browser based Arvue IDE."
1723796,14040,9078,Relighting from multiple color and depth images using matrix factorization,2014,"In this paper, we propose a novel relighting approach that takes advantage of the 3D shape information acquired from a depth sensor. Assuming distant illumination and Lambertian reflectance, we model the reflected light field in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients of the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and lighting. To estimate both the reflectance and illumination, different illumination samples can be generated through moving the object of interest in space while keeping the light source unchanged. The samples are registered onto the base view's coordinate frame using camera pose estimated from multiple depth maps. Our results indicate that we can successfully recover both illumination and diffuse BRDF (up to a global scaling ambiguity). Our method can be used to estimate complex illumination in indoor environments for applications such as lighting transfer."
2221806,14040,9896,Managing mobile multitasking: the culture of iPhones on stanford campus,2013,"This paper discusses three concepts that govern technosocial practices among university students with iPhones. First is the social expectation of  constant connection  that requires multitasking to achieve. Second is the resulting  technosocial pecking order  of who gets interrupted or ignored for whom. Third is the way that many students push back against these demands with  techno-resistance , deliberately curtailing constant connection to reduce the negative effects of multitasking, in spite of the risk of social censure. These concepts are developed from interviews with 57 students, 30 hours of field observations, and a survey of 177 students on Stanford campus, which in particular explored iPhone use. This research concludes that so-called digital natives must still navigate familiar social dynamics and personal desires, both online and off. Providing a detailed description of how students from across campus make sense of iPhones in their everyday technosocial assemblages, this research suggests opportunities for more socially and cognitively sensitive design of smartphone features."
2283098,14040,9896,Thanks and tweets: comparing two public displays,2011,"Two public display systems, with different methods of posting, were deployed over several years. One, the Thank You Board, was designed to give people an outlet specifically for publicly thanking and acknowledging others in the community. The other, SI Display, showed any Twitter post directed to the display and did not have explicit usage guidelines. People preferred the flexibility of the latter, but ambiguity about its purpose and norms of usage persisted even six months after deployment and made some people hesitant to post. Also, using Twitter as the posting mechanism facilitated participation for some but also created barriers for those not using Twitter and for Twitter users who were wary of mixing their professional and non-professional contexts."

In particular, siblings can be influential play partners and teachers, providing important scaffolding to each other. We report our observations of eight sibling pairs between ages 6 and 10, playing four popular games of different gaming paradigms. We found that certain patterns of sibling behavior persisted through all game sessions, regardless of the play patterns afforded by the different games, and that parents reports were consistent with our observations. We also observed instances where game design seemed to influence sibling play dynamics. We share our insights into considerations for designing for sibling play, including specialized social dynamics, opportunities for scaffolding, and the particular challenges they present."
2307030,14040,9896,Social structure and depression in TrevorSpace,2014,"We discover patterns related to depression in the social graph of an online community of approximately 20,000 lesbian, gay, and bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth. With survey data on fewer than two hundred community members and the network graph of the entire community (which is completely anonymous except for the survey responses), we detected statistically significant correlations between a number of graph properties and those TrevorSpace users showing a higher likelihood of depression, according to the Patient Healthcare Questionnaire-9, a standard instrument for estimating depression. Our results suggest that those who are less depressed are more deeply integrated into the social fabric of TrevorSpace than those who are more depressed. Our techniques may apply to other hard-to-reach online communities, like gay men on Facebook, where obtaining detailed information about individuals is difficult or expensive, but obtaining the social graph is not."
2082282,14040,9896,SPARSH: touch the cloud,2011,"SPARSH presents a seamless way of passing data among multiple users and devices. The user touches a data item they wish to copy from a device, conceptually saving it in the user's body. Next, the user touches the other device they want to paste/pass the saved content. SPARSH uses touch-based interactions as indications for what to copy and where to pass it. Technically, the actual transfer of media happens via the information cloud. Accompanying video shows some of the SPARSH scenarios."
1965040,14040,9896,Understanding visual attention of teams in dynamic medical settings through vital signs monitor use,2013,"The purpose of this study was to understand how vital signs monitors support teamwork during trauma resuscitation -- the fast-paced and information-rich process of stabilizing critically injured patients. We analyzed 12 videos of simulated resuscitations to characterize trauma team monitor use. To structure our observations, we adopted the feedback loop concept. Our results showed that the monitor was used frequently, especially by team leaders and anesthesiologists. We identified three patterns of monitor use: (i) periods with a low frequency of short looks (glances) to maintain overall process awareness; (ii) periods with a medium frequency of long looks (scrutiny) to monitor trends in patient status; and (iii) peaks with a high frequency of glances to maintain attention on both the patient and monitor during critical tasks. Approximately 75% of looks were 3 seconds or shorter, but many looks (25%) ranged between 3 and 26 seconds. Our results have implications for improving displays by presenting the status of the patient's physiological systems and team activities."
2467519,14040,65,Recognizing situations that demand trust,2011,"This article presents an investigation into the theoretical and computational aspects of trust as applied to robots. It begins with an in-depth review of the trust literature in search of a definition for trust suitable for implementation on a robot. Next we apply the definition to our interdependence framework for social action selection and develop an algorithm for determining if an interaction demands trust on the part of the robot. Finally, we apply our algorithm to several canonical social situations and review the resulting indications of whether or not the situation demands trust."
2338029,14040,8839,Distinguishing users with capacitive touch communication,2012,"As we are surrounded by an ever-larger variety of post-PC devices, the traditional methods for identifying and authenticating users have become cumbersome and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a capacitive communication method through which a device can recognize who is interacting with it. This method exploits the capacitive touchscreens, which are now used in laptops, phones, and tablets, as a signal receiver. The signal that identifies the user can be generated by a small transmitter embedded into a ring, watch, or other artifact carried on the human body. We explore two example system designs with a low-power continuous transmitter that communicates through the skin and a signet ring that needs to be touched to the screen. Experiments with our prototype transmitter and tablet receiver show that capacitive communication through a touchscreen is possible, even without hardware or firmware modifications on a receiver. This latter approach imposes severe limits on the data rate, but the rate is sufficient for differentiating users in multiplayer tablet games or parental control applications. Controlled experiments with a signal generator also indicate that future designs may be able to achieve datarates that are useful for providing less obtrusive authentication with similar assurance as PIN codes or swipe patterns commonly used on smartphones today."
1319266,14040,8927,Auralist: introducing serendipity into music recommendation,2012,"Recommendation systems exist to help users discover content in a large body of items. An ideal recommendation system should mimic the actions of a trusted friend or expert, producing a personalised collection of recommendations that balance between the desired goals of accuracy, diversity, novelty and serendipity. We introduce the  Auralist  recommendation framework, a system that - in contrast to previous work - attempts to balance and improve all four factors simultaneously. Using a collection of novel algorithms inspired by principles of serendipitous discovery, we demonstrate a method of successfully injecting serendipity, novelty and diversity into recommendations whilst limiting the impact on accuracy. We evaluate  Auralist  quantitatively over a broad set of metrics and, with a user study on music recommendation, show that  Auralist's  emphasis on serendipity indeed improves user satisfaction."
1843312,14040,9896,Integrating on-demand fact-checking with public dialogue,2014,"Public dialogue plays a key role in democratic society. Such dialogue often contains factual claims, but participants and readers are left wondering what to believe, particularly when contributions to such dialogue come from a broad spectrum of the public. We explore the design space for introducing authoritative information into public dialogue, with the goal of supporting constructive rather than confrontational discourse. We also present a specific design and realization of an archetypal sociotechnical system of this kind, namely an on-demand fact-checking service integrated into a crowdsourced voters guide powered by deliberating citizens. The fact-checking service was co-designed with and staffed by professional librarians. Our evaluation examines the service from the perspectives of both users and librarians."
2256043,14040,9896,Coordinating donors on crowdfunding websites,2014,"Crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter, Spot.Us and Donor's Choose seek to fund multiple projects simultaneously by soliciting donations from a large number of donors. Crowdfunding site designers must decide what to do with donations to projects that don't reach their goal by the deadline. Some crowdfunding sites use an all-or-nothing return rule in which donations are returned to donors if a project doesn't meet its goal. Other sites use a direct donation structure where all donations are kept by the project even if the total is insufficient. We simulated a crowdfunding site using a threshold public goods game in which a set of donors tries to fund multiple projects that vary in riskiness. We find that the return rule mechanism leads to a marginal improvement in productivity of a site -- more money is donated in total -- by eliciting more donations. However, the return rule also leads to a potential loss in efficiency (percentage of projects funded) because donations become spread across too many projects and are not coordinated to achieve the maximum possible impact. The direct donation model, though, encourages donors to coordinate to creates a more efficient but slightly less productive marketplace."
1877539,14040,8927,Overcoming browser cookie churn with clustering,2012,"Many large Internet websites are accessed by users anonymously, without requiring registration or logging-in. However, to provide personalized service these sites build anonymous, yet persistent, user models based on repeated user visits. Cookies, issued when a web browser first visits a site, are typically employed to anonymously associate a website visit with a distinct user (web browser). However, users may reset cookies, making such association short-lived and noisy. In this paper we propose a solution to the cookie churn problem: a novel algorithm for grouping similar cookies into clusters that are more persistent than individual cookies. Such clustering could potentially allow more robust estimation of the number of unique visitors of the site over a certain long time period, and also better user modeling which is key to plenty of web applications such as advertising and recommender systems.   We present a novel method to cluster browser cookies into groups that are likely to belong to the same browser based on a statistical model of browser visitation patterns. We address each step of the clustering as a binary classification problem estimating the probability that two different subsets of cookies belong to the same browser. We observe that our clustering problem is a generalized interval graph coloring problem, and propose a greedy heuristic algorithm for solving it. The scalability of this method allows us to cluster hundreds of millions of browser cookies and provides significant improvements over baselines such as constrained K-means."
1234733,14040,65,Conveying emotion intensity with bio-inspired expressive walking - Experiments with sadness and happiness,2013,"The understanding of emotions in humans is really important in the Human-Robot Interaction field. The affective state of a person can be expressed in several ways, one of them being through the way we walk and our gait can convey emotional clues in social context. Those clues can be used to improve the personal interactions with our peers or add meaning to any message we want to express. However, only a few studies in humanoid robotics were done on the effects of the emotions on the walking. In this paper, we propose to assess the emotional walking patterns created from motion capture data with a survey. Those patterns represent different emotions (sadness, happiness) with different intensities (middle, high and exaggerated). Those emotional walking patterns achieved a high recognition rate of the emotions and the subjects (N=13) could recognize whole body emotions without facial expression on our humanoid robot. Additionally, we found out that at first people might perform poorly at recognizing emotions and their intensities but can get better, even without correction or feedback on their performances."
2308090,14040,9896,The effects of consistency maintenance methods on player experience and performance in networked games,2014,"Network lag is a fact of life for networked games. Lag can cause game states to diverge at different nodes in the network, making it difficult to maintain the illusion of a single shared space. Traditional lag compensation techniques help reduce inconsistency in networked games; however, these techniques do not address what to do when states actually have diverged. Traditional consistency maintenance (CM) does not specify how to make game- critical decisions when players' views of the shared state are different, nor does it indicate how to repair inconsistencies. These two issues -- decision-making and error repair -- can have substantial effects on players' gaming experience. To address this shortcoming, we have characterized a range of algorithmic choices for decision- making and error repair. We report on a study confirming that these algorithms can have significant effects on player experience and performance, and showing that they are often more important than degree of consistency itself."
1556085,14040,9015,MobyDick: an interactive multi-swimmer exergame,2014,"The unique aquatic nature of swimming makes it very difficult to use social or technical strategies to mitigate the tediousness of monotonous exercises. In this study, we propose MobyDick, a smartphone-based multi-player exergame designed to be used while swimming, in which a team of swimmers collaborate to hunt down a virtual monster. In this paper, we present a novel, holistic game design that takes into account both human factors and technical challenges. Firstly, we perform a comparative analysis of a variety of wireless networking technologies in the aquatic environment and identify various technical constraints on wireless networking. Secondly, we develop a single phone-based inertial and barometric stroke activity recognition system to enable precise, real-time game inputs. Thirdly, we carefully devise a multi-player interaction mode viable in the underwater environment highly limiting the abilities of human communication. Finally, we prototype MobyDick on waterproof off-the-shelf Android phones, and deploy it to real swimming pool environments (n = 8). Our qualitative analysis of user interview data reveals certain unique aspects of multi-player swimming games."

So far there is no in-depth account of how article Talk pages are used, what is wrong with them, and how they can be improved. This paper reports on three contributions promoting the understanding of and improvement of these spaces: (1) Wikipedia editor interviews provide an increased understanding of readers' and editors' needs, (2) a large-scale comparative content analysis adds to knowledge of what kinds of discussions and coordination occur on Talk pages, (3) a prototype bookmarklet-based system, which we test in a formative user evaluation, integrates lightweight semantics."
892809,14040,65,A complementing approach for identifying ethical issues in care robotics - grounding ethics in practical use,2012,"We use a long-term study of a robotic eating-aid for disabled users to illustrate how empirical use give rise to a set of ethical issues that might be overlooked in ethic discussions based on theoretical extrapolation of the current state-of-the-art in robotics. This approach provides an important complement to the existing robot ethics by revealing new issues as well as providing actionable guidance for current and future robot design. We discuss our material in relation to the literature on robot ethics, specifically the risk of robots performing care taking tasks and thus causing increased isolation for care recipients. Our data identifies a different set of ethical issues such as independence, privacy, and identity where robotics, if carefully designed and developed, can make positive contributions."
2549308,14040,30,"A Wearable, Wireless Gaze Tracker with Integrated Selection Command Source for Human‐Computer Interaction",2011,"A light-weight, wearable, wireless gaze tracker with integrated selection command source for human-computer interaction is introduced. The prototype system combines head-mounted, video-based gaze tracking with capacitive facial movement detection that enable multimodal interaction by gaze pointing and making selections with facial gestures. The system is targeted mainly to disabled people with limited mobility over their hands. The hardware was made wireless to remove the need to take off the device when moving away from the computer, and to allow future use in more mobile contexts. The algorithms responsible for determining the eye and head orientations to map gaze direction to on-screen coordinates are presented together with the one to detect movements from the measured capacitance signal. Point-and-click experiments were conducted to assess the performance of the multimodal system. The results show decent performance in laboratory and office conditions. The overall point-and-click accuracy in the multimodal experiments is comparable to the errors in previous research on head-mounted, single modality gaze tracking that does not compensate for changes in head orientation."
1571360,14040,8806,i*Chameleon: a platform for developing multimodal application with comprehensive development cycle,2013,"We present  i*Chameleon , a configurable and extensible multimodal platform for developing highly interactive applications. The platform leverages a principled and comprehensive development cycle to systematically capture the multimodal interaction artifact. Importantly, by introducing MVC architectural pattern, it enforces the concept of  separation-of-concerns  to enable cross collaboration among device engineers, programmers, modality designers and interaction designers who are collectively working on different aspects of human computer interaction and programming. Collectively, the development efforts are combined, integrated and compiled by the i*Chameleon kernel to derive the multimodal interactive application. The i*Chameleon platform sets itself apart from previous works in that it advocates the need to engineer a software development approach that leverages a MVC software architectural pattern to promote ease of software development through division of responsibilities among engineers and HCI designers. To validate the usefulness of i*Chameleon, we describe several application case examples to demonstrate the ease of developing multimodal applications through systematic integration of the design models as described above."
1708712,14040,9896,Beyond trust and reliability: reusing data in collaborative cancer epidemiology research,2013,"While previous CSCW research on data sharing and reuse has focused on how researchers assess the trust and reliability of the data of others, we know little about scientists' data use practices after that decision has been taken. This qualitative study of post-doctoral researchers' use of preexisting datasets investigates the practices of cancer-epidemiology post-docs working to understand their Small Data datasets. We report the ongoing and iterative nature of information seeking inherent in using unfamiliar data and the time-consuming and highly-collaborative process post-docs used to understand aspects of the dataset important to their scientific questions. Understanding data use practices can help inform the design of both Small Data projects and large cyberinfrastructure projects where multi-source data are collected and combined."

In the video accompanying this abstract we present a system that uses distributed sensor technology, Bayesian decision tools, and advanced map-based interfaces to facilitate collaboration between environmental experts and the public for environmental monitoring and early detection of chemical incidents."
1705856,14040,339,POSTER: TouchCtrl: fine-grained access control for collaborative environments,2013,"The design of modern desktop operating systems is based on the assumption that a single user controls input and output devices at a time. This is also the case for access control, where applications inherit the privileges from the user that started them. This is not sufficient for multi-user collaboration on Single Display Groupware (SDG) or tabletop systems. For these we suggest a more fine-grained access control method based on the user that is interacting with an application.   In our ongoing work of building a multi-user multitouch system we developed a technique we call event backtracking that exploits the asynchronous behavior of modern desktop applications on the Mac OS X platform.   Event backtracking follows the execution of a program and tags threads with user IDs taken from the input events of users. This information is subsequently used to dynamically restrict applications' access rights. Our implementation works within applications as well as across application borders, transparent to the applications themselves."
2339778,14040,9896,Engaging robots: easing complex human-robot teamwork using backchanneling,2013,"People are increasingly working with robots in teams and recent research has focused on how human-robot teams function, but little attention has yet been paid to the role of social signaling behavior in human-robot teams. In a controlled experiment, we examined the role of backchanneling and task complexity on team functioning and perceptions of the robots' engagement and competence. Based on results from 73 participants interacting with autonomous humanoid robots as part of a human-robot team (one participant, one confederate, and three robots), we found that when robots used backchanneling team functioning improved and the robots were seen as more engaged. Ironically, the robots using backchanneling were perceived as less competent than those that did not. Our results suggest that backchanneling plays an important role in human-robot teams and that the design and implementation of robots for human-robot teams may be more effective if backchanneling capability is provided."
2274536,14040,9896,To search or to ask: the routing of information needs between traditional search engines and social networks,2014,"In status message question asking (SMQA), members of social networking sites make use of status messages to express information needs to friends and contacts. We present findings from a laboratory study that examined 82 participants' SMQA behaviors in the broader context of online information seeking. When given the option of using a search engine and/or a social network, participants leveraged SMQA for 20% of their information needs, most often posing a question to their network in addition to issuing a query. We show the important roles played by the specificity of the information need and the perceived audience of a given network on routing decisions. We then demonstrate that routing decisions have varied effects on participants' satisfaction, information value, and trust of outcomes. In addition to highlighting the complementary advantages and disadvantages of search and SMQA, our findings suggest that search engines can better address a meaningful portion of people's information needs by integrating SMQA capabilities into their systems."
2492938,14040,422,Learning to question: leveraging user preferences for shopping advice,2013,"We present ShoppingAdvisor, a novel recommender system that helps users in shopping for technical products. ShoppingAdvisor leverages both user preferences and technical product attributes in order to generate its suggestions. The system elicits user preferences via a tree-shaped flowchart, where each node is a question to the user. At each node, ShoppingAdvisor suggests a ranking of products matching the preferences of the user, and that gets progressively refined along the path from the tree's root to one of its leafs.   In this paper we show ( i ) how to learn the structure of the tree, i.e., which questions to ask at each node, and ( ii ) how to produce a suitable ranking at each node. First, we adapt the classical top-down strategy for building decision trees in order to find the best user attribute to ask at each node. Differently from decision trees, ShoppingAdvisor partitions the user space rather than the product space. Second, we show how to employ a learning-to-rank approach in order to learn, for each node of the tree, a ranking of products appropriate to the users who reach that node.   We experiment with two real-world datasets for cars and cameras, and a synthetic one. We use mean reciprocal rank to evaluate ShoppingAdvisor, and show how the performance increases by more than 50% along the path from root to leaf. We also show how collaborative recommendation algorithms such as  k -nearest neighbor benefits from feature selection done by the ShoppingAdvisor tree. Our experiments show that ShoppingAdvisor produces good quality interpretable recommendations, while requiring less input from users and being able to handle the cold-start problem."
1896160,14040,9896,"Life transitions and online health communities: reflecting on adoption, use, and disengagement",2014,"Online health communities are places where people can come together in order to exchange social support at a particular point in an individual's life. There are, however, relatively few accounts that look across multiple communities across the lifespan. In this paper, we reflect on four case studies of research on different online health communities in order to identify patterns in how individuals selectively adopt, use, and disengage from these communities throughout their lives. We argue that users leaving communities is not necessarily a failing of the site's design or purpose; rather, it is a logical reaction to changing life circumstances. In characterizing this pattern, we contribute a set of implications for design and management that bear consideration by online community designers, developers, moderators, and end users. Ultimately this may lead to a smoother transition from community to community and ensure that social support needs are being met more consistently in response to changing life circumstances."
2468025,14040,9896,The use of awareness displays for role clarity in distributed workgroups,2012,"During group work, sometimes members' roles are unclear, which leads to confusion about which activities one should do. This may be especially true in distributed groups, where it is harder to see what others are doing, and when roles are not assigned to members. Awareness displays can provide information to group members to help them determine their roles. I will explore this using collaborative groups in multi-player online games. This study will first observe groups to identify factors associated with role ambiguity, develop an awareness display which provides role--related information, and lastly, test the display in an experimental setting."
2100881,14040,9896,Remain Faithful to the Earth!*: Reporting Experiences of Artifact-Centered Design in Healthcare,2011,In this paper we report about two design experiences in the domain of healthcare information technology that shed light on the advantages of getting rid of complex and abstract representations of hospital work and of concentrating on the artifacts that practitioners habitually use in their daily practice. We ground our approach in the recent literature on the often unintended shortcomings exhibited by healthcare information systems and propose a lightweight method to support the phases of requirement elicitation and functional design. We then discuss the main requirements expressed in our recent research activity and provide examples of how to address them in terms of modular and reusable design solutions.
172181,14040,422,Multi-touch Graph-Based Interaction for Knowledge Discovery on Mobile Devices: State-of-the-Art and Future Challenges,2014,"Graph-based knowledge representation is a hot topic for some years and still has a lot of research potential, particularly in the ad- vancement in the application of graph-theory for creating benefits in the biomedical domain. Graphs are most powerful tools to map struc- tures within a given data set and to recognize relationships between specific data objects. Many advantages of graph-based data structures can be found in the applicability of methods from network analysis, topo- logy and data mining (e.g. small-world phenomenon, cluster analysis). In this paper we present the state-of-the-art in graph-based approaches for multi-touch interaction on mobile devices and we highlight some open problems to stimulate further research and future developments. This is particularly important in the medical domain, as a conceptual graph analysis may provide novel insights on hidden patterns in data, hence support interactive knowledge discovery."
1012011,14040,9078,Video abstraction in social media: Augmenting facebook's EdgeRank algorithm in video content presentation,2013,"Social networks need to manage and control the drift of huge amounts of information by filtering and summarizing everything, in order to ensure they satisfy users' viewing pleasure. Until now social media content has already been used in a variety of applications such as for ranking of news stories, for profiling of user preferences, even for products' recommendations. However, this type of conversational, user-generated content might be used to add value to more traditional event media, such as video. In this paper we examine the capability of automatically producing meaningful summaries of generic videos. To do so we consider EdgeRank's affinity, weight and time decay parameters and implement a CLARANS-based key-frames extraction scheme. This paper forms an initial study of a social media video abstraction service and experiments indicate its promising performance."
1709816,14040,30,Understanding Clinical Work Practices for Cross-Boundary Decision Support in e-Health,2012,"One of the major concerns of research in integrated healthcare information systems is to enable decision support among clinicians across boundaries of organizations and regional workgroups. A necessary precursor, however, is to facilitate the construction of appropriate awareness of local clinical practices, including a clinician's actual cognitive capabilities, peculiar workplace circumstances, and specific patient-centered needs based on real-world clinical contexts across work settings. In this paper, a user-centered study aimed to investigate clinical practices across three different geographical areas-the U.K., the UAE and Nigeria-is presented. The findings indicate that differences in clinical practices among clinicians are associated with differences in local work contexts across work settings, but are moderated by adherence to best practice guidelines and the need for patient-centered care. The study further reveals that an awareness especially of the ontological, stereotypical, and situated practices plays a crucial role in adapting knowledge for cross-boundary decision support. The paper then outlines a set of design guidelines for the development of enterprise information systems for e-health. Based on the guidelines, the paper proposes the conceptual design of CaDHealth, a practice-centered framework for making sense of clinical practices across work settings for effective cross-boundary e-health decision support."
2231520,14040,9896,Supporting collaborative care in an emergency department (ED) through patient awareness,2014,"Patient-provider collaboration is considered crucial to successful patient care. However, while many CSCW and health informatics studies have focused on collaborative care incorporating patient awareness in chronic care management, very little attention has been given to emergency care. I am conducting a qualitative study of patient care trajectories in an emergency department (ED), examining patient awareness, decision-making and patient-clinician interaction in an information-imbalanced environment, particularly in situations of information deprivation. My research will enrich understandings of collaborative care practices in a hospital setting and can inform extended designs of the current provider-centric, socio-technical systems to incorporate patient-provider collaboration."

However there are various commercial products for creating movies and game contents, those are still difficult to deal with for non-professional users. To ease the creation process and encourage to utilize 3D animation for the general users, e.g., in the field of such as education, medicine and so on, we propose a system using Kinect. The data of skeleton models of human motion estimated by Kinect is processed to generate Motion Graph and finally restructure the data automatically for 3D character models. We also propose an efficient 3D animation viewing system based on touch interface for tablet device, which enables intuitive control of multiple motions of the human activity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, we implemented a prototype system and created several 3D animations."

In this work, we present results from a qualitative study to understand the role of social interaction and information-sharing surrounding high-risk infants among both home caregivers and health professionals. These results demonstrate challenges in communication and social support for caregivers of these infants. Based on these results, we present design guidelines for collaborative communication technologies for this population and a prototype system design that demonstrates how these design guidelines might be met in a mobile application. Finally, we discuss how collaborative technologies can serve to improve communication with professionals as well as provide much-needed social support."

2245548,14040,9896,Ensemble: exploring complementary strengths of leaders and crowds in creative collaboration,2014,"In story writing, the diverse perspectives of the crowd could support an author's search for the perfect character, setting, or plot. However, structuring crowd collaboration is challenging. Too little structure leads to unfocused, sprawling narratives, and too much structure stifles creativity. Motivated by the idea that individual creative leaders and the crowd have complementary creative strengths, we present an approach where a leader directs the high-level vision for a story and articulates creative constraints for the crowd. This approach is embodied in Ensemble, a novel collaborative story-writing platform. In a month-long short story competition, over one hundred volunteer users on the web started over fifty short stories using Ensemble. Leaders used the platform to direct collaborator work by establishing creative goals, and collaborators contributed meaningful, high-level ideas to stories through specific suggestions. This work suggests that asymmetric creative contributions may support a broad new class of creative collaborations."
1392465,14040,9475,Power line control under uncertainty of ambient temperature,2013,"This paper discusses a control scheme for maintaining low tripping probability of a transmission system power line under thermal stress. We construct a stochastic differential equation to describe the temperature evolution in a line subject to randomness of the ambient temperature. When the distribution of the ambient temperature changes, so does the dependence of the tripping probability as a function of line current. The theory of extremes of Gaussian random fields is used to guide the size of the underlying frequency inspection so as to insure that current is effective for controlling the risk of overheating. In particular, we show that only when the change of temperature is suitably light-tailed (according to a precise definition discussed in the paper), the current provides a powerful enough mechanism to control tripping probabilities due to overheating. We then provide bounds that can be used to control the tripping probability in our stochastic model."

Examination of differences across experts revealed that the most highly rated group of experts responded to 69% of the questions with a median response time of 16 minutes, twice as fast as other experts. Finally, we demonstrate the high quality of response through a taxonomy that characterizes expert responses as: framing, guiding, or engaged help."
1832601,14040,9896,Taking as an act of sharing,2012,"We present findings from the deployment of a mobile application,  Take and Give , which allows users to place image files in a virtual folder or 'Pocket' on a mobile phone. This content can be viewed by a set of 'Buddies', who can, if they wish, attempt to take ownership of a file for themselves, following which they can keep it, delete it, or place it in the Pocket of someone else. There is only one version of each file, creating a twist on traditional sharing technologies. We report findings from a three week trial of the application in an office space, and describe how Take and Give provided a means of self-presentation and supported a sense of awareness, mutual attentiveness and connectedness. Our findings suggest that the taking of unique content can be an engaging form of sharing and can facilitate awareness and connectedness between people."

We studied a fundamental issue for such sites: what patterns of activity attract attention (audience and content reposting)-- We organized our studies around two key factors: the extent to which users specialize in particular topics, and homophily among users. We also considered the existence of differences between female and male users. We found: (a) women and men differed in the types of content they collected and the degree to which they specialized; male Pinterest users were not particularly interested in stereotypically male topics; (b) sharing diverse types of content increases your following, but only up to a certain point; (c) homophily drives repinning: people repin content from other users who share their interests; homophily also affects following, but to a lesser extent. Our findings suggest strategies both for users (e.g., strategies to attract an audience) and maintainers (e.g., content recommendation methods) of social curation sites."
1796304,14040,9896,From organizational to community creativity: paragon leadership & creativity stories at etsy,2013,"With the rise of massive scale, globally distributed creative communities, such as Deviant Art, Etsy, and Minecraft, the role of creative leadership in sociotechnical systems is worth investigating. This paper presents a case study of one strategy Etsy, one such online creative community, uses to articulate the creative dispositions of the community's exemplar members: Featured Seller interviews. For this study, we report on a combined content analysis and close reading of Featured Seller interviews on Etsy.com, followed up with member check interviews. Our analysis highlights the demographics of featured sellers, the ways in they express their identities and creative processes, and how they position themselves within the broader Etsy community. Our findings demonstrate that Etsy's administrators provide both a platform and scaffolding for community leaders to co-articulate with them the creative ideals they believe will strengthen the bonds of the Etsy community."
2450335,14040,9078,Statistical shape models of plant leaves,2013,"The shapes of plant leaves are of great importance to plant biologists and botanists, as they can help in distinguishing plant species, measuring their health, analyzing their growth patterns, and understanding relations between various species. We propose a statistical model that uses the Squared Root Velocity Function representation and a Riemannian elastic metric to model the observed variability in the shape of plant leaves. We show that under this representation, one can compute sample means and principal modes of variations and can characterize the observed shapes using probability models, such as Gaussians, on the tangent spaces at the sample means. The approach is fully automatic and does not require precomputing correspondences between the shapes. We validate these statistical models by analyzing their classification performance on standard benchmarks and show their utility as generative models for random sampling."
2267778,14040,9896,Bribecaster: documenting bribes through community participation,2012,"Corruption is endemic in many emerging economies - many transactions of private citizens with government institutions require payment of bribes. While well known as a general phenomenon, specific data about the bribe economy are hard to come by. But such data are needed for rational responses to corruption at the societal and individual level - to expose it; to know which offices to avoid; or to know how much to pay if other recourse is not available. In response to a corruption survey of 102 Indian participants we are developing  Bribecaster , a mobile application that enables citizen collection and curation of corruption data. A key research question is how to create a system that has accurate data while simultaneously protecting users from repercussions of having their identities revealed."
1587465,14040,9896,Concealment of Emotion in an Emergency Room: Expanding Design for Emotion Awareness,2013,"The design of systems and mechanisms for the development of emotion awareness between communicators has been a concern in CSCW. The typical approach in design is tied up in notions of mediated communication being a `poor' transmitter of crucial emotion information. Thus, by conveying emotion expressions, emotion awareness is consequently supported. In this paper we argue that emotion awareness is also reliant on strategic concealment of emotion expressions through hiding and suppression. To support our argument we present data from a field study of the expression of emotion between healthcare personnel in an emergency room. We provide evidence of the hiding and suppression of emotion expressions by both expressers and observers and how these behaviors support the development of emotion awareness. We then outline a new system design perspective for emotion awareness including both conveyance and concealment behavior and provide examples of systems that have successfully embodied notions of hiding and suppression."
2027275,14040,9896,Xpointer: an x-ray telepointer for relaxed-space-time wysiwis and unconstrained collaborative 3d design systems,2013,"Telepointers are a real-time collaborative feature to indicate pointing at shared objects. Existing telepointing techniques are, however, restricted to pointing at the foremost object underneath a mouse cursor in  relaxed-space  but  strict-time  WYSIWIS environments. In real-time collaborative 3D design systems with animation creation capabilities, multiple 3D objects can be simultaneously visible underneath mouse cursors for users to freely and concurrently work on and point at ( unconstrained  collaboration), and multiple users can view 3D workspaces and point from different viewing perspectives ( relaxed-space  WYSIWIS) and animation time frames ( relaxed-time  WYSIWIS). This paper contributes a novel  XPointer  technique with the capability of pointing through objects correctly and consistently from different viewing perspectives and time frames, even in the presence of concurrent editing work. This work is the first to identify and address these advanced 3D telepointing needs and capabilities, and to extend the concept of relaxed WYSIWIS to include the time aspect. The XPointer has been implemented in the  CoMaya  real-time collaborative 3D design system (demonstration video: http://cooffice.ntu.edu.sg/comaya/videoXPointer.php)."
2106413,14040,9896,Quick and dirty: streamlined 3D scanning in archaeology,2014,"Capturing data is a key part of archaeological practice, whether for preserving records or to aid interpretation. But the technologies used are complex and expensive, resulting in time-consuming processes associated with their use. These processes force a separation between ongoing interpretive work and capture. Through two field studies we elicit more detail as to what is important about this interpretive work and what might be gained through a closer integration of capture technology with these practices. Drawing on these insights, we go on to present a novel, portable, wireless 3D modeling system that emphasizes quick and dirty capture. We discuss its design rational in relation to our field observations and evaluate this rationale further by giving the system to archaeological experts to explore in a variety of settings. While our device compromises on the resolution of traditional 3D scanners, its support of interpretation through emphasis on real-time capture, review and manipulability suggests it could be a valuable tool for the future of archaeology."
2415999,14040,8960,A Denoising View of Matrix Completion,2011,"In matrix completion, we are given a matrix where the values of only some of the entries are present, and we want to reconstruct the missing ones. Much work has focused on the assumption that the data matrix has low rank. We propose a more general assumption based on denoising, so that we expect that the value of a missing entry can be predicted from the values of neighboring points. We propose a nonparametric version of denoising based on local, iterated averaging with mean-shift, possibly constrained to preserve local low-rank manifold structure. The few user parameters required (the denoising scale, number of neighbors and local dimensionality) and the number of iterations can be estimated by cross-validating the reconstruction error. Using our algorithms as a postprocessing step on an initial reconstruction (provided by e.g. a low-rank method), we show consistent improvements with synthetic, image and motion-capture data."
1530259,14040,422,Multi-space probabilistic sequence modeling,2013,"Learning algorithms that embed objects into Euclidean space have become the methods of choice for a wide range of problems, ranging from recommendation and image search to playlist prediction and language modeling. Probabilistic embedding methods provide elegant approaches to these problems, but can be expensive to train and store as a large monolithic model. In this paper, we propose a method that trains not one monolithic model, but multiple local embeddings for a class of pairwise conditional models especially suited for sequence and co-occurrence modeling. We show that computation and memory for training these multi-space models can be efficiently parallelized over many nodes of a cluster. Focusing on sequence modeling for music playlists, we show that the method substantially speeds up training while maintaining high model quality."
1435980,14040,8806,Motivating people to perform better in exergames: competition in virtual environments,2014,"Repetitive indoor exercises as running on a treadmill or cycling on an exercise bike use to be tedious, meanwhile immersive virtual environments can bring a greater incentive especially when combined with other sources of motivation such as competition. In this work we introduce Running Wheel, an exergame with both single player and competitive modes with real time capture of heartbeat rhythm and speed of the treadmill. Two hypotheses were tested: (a) there is difference between users that ran with the competitive mode versus the single player mode; and (b) there is difference in performance depending on the kind of competitor picked. We evaluated the system with 12 volunteers which performed at least 6 jogging sessions. Results show that participants got strongly motivated and most of them tried to overcome their limitations and overtake others which in turn led to more effort, perceived by an increase in heartbeat rhythm."
1730199,14040,9896,A system for receiving crowd feedback on visual designs,2014,"This paper proposes a demonstration of Voyant, a novel system giving users access to a non-expert crowd to receive structured feedback on the perceptions of their designs from a target audience. Voyant generates the elements seen in a design, the order in which elements are noticed, impressions formed when the design is first viewed, and interpretation of the design relative to guidelines in the domain and the user's stated goals. The coordinated views in Voyant is designed to help user analyze relations between the crowd's perception of a design and the visual elements within it."
2235536,14040,9896,Bootstrapping wikis: developing critical mass in a fledgling community by seeding content,2012,"Online communities depend on content contributed by their members. However, new communities have not yet achieved critical mass and are vulnerable to inadequate contribution. To encourage contribution, many fledgling communities seed the site with data from 3rd parties. We study the effectiveness of such seeding by looking at how people react to different types of seeded content. We found that people make larger contributions when there is no seeded content. But when there is seeded content, users learn from that content and contribute similar types of content. Therefore, if websites prefer specific types of contributions, seeding that type of contribution can be a valuable way to elicit appropriate contributions."
1858428,14040,9896,CoupleVIBE: mobile implicit communication to improve awareness for (long-distance) couples,2011,"Long-distance couples face considerable communication challenges in their relationships. Unlike collocated couples, long-distance couples lack awareness cues associated with physical proximity and must use technologies such as SMS or telephony to stay in sync. We posit that long-distance couples have needs that are not met by prevailing communication technologies, which require explicit action from the sender as well as the receiver. We built CoupleVIBE to explore the properties of an implicit messaging channel and observe how couples would use such a technology. CoupleVIBE is a mobile application that automatically pushes a user's location-information to her partner's mobile phone via vibrotactile cues. We present qualitative results of a four-week user study, studying how seven couples used CoupleVIBE. A key result is that CoupleVIBE's implicit communication modality operated as a foundation that helps keep couples in sync, with other modalities being brought into play when further interaction was needed."
1765504,14040,9896,Beyond data sharing: artifact ecology of a collaborative nanophotonics research centre,2012,"Scientific communities have long been concerned with the design and implementation of effective infrastructures for data access and collaborative scientific work. Recent studies have shown an increase in collaborative data generation and reuse. However, further improvements require a deeper understanding of the social and technological circumstances under which they emerge. To that effect we conduct  in-situ  observation study of a Nano-photonics Research Centre. We consider the  artifact ecology  that evolved from the Centre's common experimentation and data platform, the scientific practices, and the intricate interactions with digital artifacts that arise from the researchers' activities. We uncover the use of progress  summaries  for collaborative data interpretation and knowledge sharing. By studying this reputable collaborative scientific environment we (1) identified the factors that led to its functional and effective artifact ecology and (2) propose expansions of tools and services to improve it further. The latter include effective support for contextual search, browsing, and flexible viewing of information artifacts based on relevant parameters and properties."
1674715,14040,9896,Web-based multipointer interaction on shared displays,2011,"Interaction with multiple mouse pointers is becoming widespread for collocated collaboration on shared displays, but most technologies used to implement it do not support telepresent users. While web technologies are a common standard for applications that enable telepresent collaboration, they do not support the multipointer interaction needed for collaboration in collocated settings. We propose an approach to provide multipointer interaction in web applications by adding multipointer support to the web browser and addressing pointer handling in a JavaScript framework."
1689008,14040,9896,Voyant: generating structured feedback on visual designs using a crowd of non-experts,2014,"Feedback on designs is critical for helping users iterate toward effective solutions. This paper presents Voyant, a novel system giving users access to a non-expert crowd to receive perception-oriented feedback on their designs from a selected audience. Based on a formative study, the system generates the elements seen in a design, the order in which elements are noticed, impressions formed when the design is first viewed, and interpretation of the design relative to guidelines in the domain and the user's stated goals. An evaluation of the system was conducted with users and their designs. Users reported the feedback about impressions and interpretation of their goals was most helpful, though the other feedback types were also valued. Users found the coordinated views in Voyant useful for analyzing relations between the crowd's perception of a design and the visual elements within it. The cost of generating the feedback was considered a reasonable tradeoff for not having to organize critiques or interrupt peers."
1819549,14040,9896,The post that wasn't: exploring self-censorship on facebook,2013,"Social networking site users must decide what content to share and with whom. Many social networks, including Facebook, provide tools that allow users to selectively share content or block people from viewing content. However, sometimes instead of targeting a particular audience, users will self-censor, or choose not to share. We report the results from an 18-participant user study designed to explore self-censorship behavior as well as the subset of unshared content participants would have potentially shared if they could have specifically targeted desired audiences. We asked participants to report all content they thought about sharing but decided not to share on Facebook and interviewed participants about why they made sharing decisions and with whom they would have liked to have shared or not shared. Participants reported that they would have shared approximately half the unshared content if they had been able to exactly target their desired audiences."
1760129,14040,9896,LACOME: a multi-user collaboration system for shared large displays,2012,"In this paper we describe LACOME, which is a collaboration system that allows multiple users to simultaneously publish their computer desktops to a shared large screen display, and also allows other users to interact with the displayed information on a variety of semantic levels. LACOME features our LSO (Large Screen Optimized) window manipulation technique that utilizes the entire window for manipulations instead of only the title-bar and borders and includes 'snapping regions' that automatically move the cursor to the window's boundary, allowing quick, accurate manipulations at the edges and corners of the screen."
1336506,14040,8228,Using minimization of maximal regret for interface selection in a heterogeneous wireless network,2012,"Integration of various wireless access technologies have pushed the evolution of mobile clients (MC) to be equipped with multiple interfaces for simultaneously accessing different network technologies. In these heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs), MCs (and the underlying network) must be able to quickly and dynamically adapt to varying network conditions so as to satisfy required communication constraints. However, unlike their machine counterparts, MCs tend to have very vague and uncertain demands. This paper focuses on imprecise and dynamic nature of the MC's demands, while fulfilling multiple — often contradicting — constraints. The problem of uncertain decision making is considered by utilizing techniques from the multiple criteria decision making area. At each MC, an enhanced minimization of maximal regret (MMR) ranks available network interfaces and this maps imprecise user constraints to ranked interfaces."
1164185,14040,9099,AirTouch panel: a re-anchorable virtual touch panel,2013,"To achieve maximum mobility, device-less approaches for home appliance remote control have received increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a screen-less virtual touch panel, called AirTouch Panel, which can be positioned at any place with various orientations around users. The proposed virtual touch panel provides a potential ability to remotely control the home appliances, such as television, air conditioner, and so on. The proposed system allows users to anchor the panel at the place with comfortable poses. If the users want to change panel's position or orientation, they only need to re-anchor it, and then the panel will be reset. In this paper, our main contribution is to design a re-anchorable virtual panel for digital home remote control. Most importantly, we explore the design of such imaginary interface through two user studies. In our user studies, we analyze task completion time, satisfaction rate, and the number of miss-clicks. We are interested in the feasibility issues, for example, proper click gesture, panel size and button size, etc. Moreover, based on the AirTouch Panel, we also developed an intelligent TV to demonstrate the usability for controlling home appliance."
1726755,14040,8502,Multi-leaf alignment from fluorescence plant images,2014,"In this paper, we propose a multi-leaf alignment framework based on Chamfer matching to study the problem of leaf alignment from fluorescence images of plants, which will provide a leaf-level analysis of photosynthetic activities. Different from the naive procedure of aligning leaves iteratively using the Chamfer distance, the new algorithm aims to find the best alignment of multiple leaves simultaneously in an input image. We formulate an optimization problem of an objective function with three terms: the average of chamfer distances of aligned leaves, the number of leaves, and the difference between the synthesized mask by the leaf candidates and the original image mask. Gradient descent is used to minimize our objective function. A quantitative evaluation framework is also formulated to test the performance of our algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-leaf alignment optimization performs substantially better than the baseline of the Chamfer matching algorithm in terms of both accuracy and efficiency."
2116697,14040,8960,Exact and Stable Recovery of Pairwise Interaction Tensors,2013,"Tensor completion from incomplete observations is a problem of significant practical interest. However, it is unlikely that there exists an efficient algorithm with provable guarantee to recover a general tensor from a limited number of observations. In this paper, we study the recovery algorithm for pairwise interaction tensors, which has recently gained considerable attention for modeling multiple attribute data due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Specifically, in the absence of noise, we show that one can exactly recover a pairwise interaction tensor by solving a constrained convex program which minimizes the weighted sum of nuclear norms of matrices from O(nr log2(n)) observations. For the noisy cases, we also prove error bounds for a constrained convex program for recovering the tensors. Our experiments on the synthetic dataset demonstrate that the recovery performance of our algorithm agrees well with the theory. In addition, we apply our algorithm on a temporal collaborative filtering task and obtain state-of-the-art results."
1707060,14040,9896,Working around official applications: experiences from a large engineering project,2011,"We describe facets of specialized software applications developed to support a large collaborative engineering program. Although many of the applications were bespoke efforts, designed to the requirements of users, virtually all major applications have an unofficial spreadsheet or database backing up the official application. These tools invariably play a critical but unofficial role in the day-to-day work, acting as more than just as a work-around, while the official applications are used primarily for mandated record keeping and auditing purposes. Surprisingly, there is often management approval for these unofficial applications, but at the same time, desire to elimination these applications and only use the official applications. We discuss the implications of this finding for future collaborative applications and long-term record keeping."
2155444,14040,9896,CrowdCamp 2013: rapidly iterating crowd ideas,2013,"The rapidly growing field of collective intelligence - encompassing crowdsourcing, human computation, and social computing - is having a tremendous impact on the way we work, live, and play. Building on the success of a CHI 2012 CrowdCamp, this two-day event focuses on developing ideas into concrete outputs: in-depth thoughts on hard problems, paper or coded prototypes, experiment design and data mining. We will bring together researchers and industry experts to discuss future visions and make tangible headway on those visions, as well as seeding collaboration. The outputs from discussion, brainstorming, and building will persist after the workshop for attendees and the community to view."
1965474,14040,9896,Towards self-optimizing collaborative systems,2012,"Two important performance metrics in collaborative systems are local and remote response times. Previous analytical and simulation work has shown that these response times depend on three important factors: processing architecture, communication architecture, and scheduling of tasks dictated by these two architectures. We show that it is possible to create a system that improves response times by dynamically adjusting these three system parameters in response to changes to collaboration parameters such as new users joining and network delays changing. We present practical approaches for collecting collaboration parameters, computing multicast overlays, applying analytical models of previous work, preserving coupling semantics during optimizations, and keeping overheads low. Simulations and experiments show that the system improves performance in practical scenarios."
2358547,14040,9896,The politics of comments: predicting political orientation of news stories with commenters' sentiment patterns,2011,"Political views frequently conflict in the coverage of contentious political issues, potentially causing serious social problems. We present a novel social annotation analysis approach for identification of news articles' political orientation. The approach focuses on the behavior of individual commenters. It uncovers commenters' sentiment patterns towards political news articles, and predicts the political orientation from the sentiments expressed in the comments. It takes advantage of commenters' participation as well as their knowledge and intelligence condensed in the sentiment of comments, thereby greatly reduces the high complexity of political view identification. We conduct extensive study on commenters' behaviors, and discover predictive commenters showing a high degree of regularity in their sentiment patterns. We develop and evaluate sentiment pattern-based methods for political view identification."
1376107,14040,8806,A unified approach to collaborative data visualization,2014,"Much efforts have lately been concentrated on increasing the precision of recommendations following the Netflix Prize competition. Recently, many researchers and industries have noted that other factors like adequate presentation of the results can add more utility to a recommender system than slight improvement in the precision. In this paper, we suggest a methodology for user-friendly representation of recommendations to the end users. Our scheme unifies the two objectives of prediction and visualization in the core of a unique approach. Users and items are first embedded into a high dimensional latent feature space according to a predictor function, particularly designated to meet visualization requirements. The data is then projected into a 2-dimensional space by Curvilinear Component Analysis (CCA). CCA draws  personalized Item Maps (PIMs)  representing a small subset of items to the active user. The intra-item semantic correlations are preserved in PIMs which is inherited from the clustering property of the high-dimensional embedding space. Our prediction function and the projection method are both non-linear to increase the clarity of the maps and to limit the effect of projection error. The algorithms are tested on three versions of the MovieLens dataset and the Netflix dataset to show they combine good accuracy with satisfactory visual properties. Moreover, a novel offline methodology is suggested to measure the quality of PIMs."
2244147,14040,9896,Dependency-conflict detection in real-time collaborative 3D design systems,2013,"One core issue in real-time collaborative 3D design systems is dependency-conflict caused by concurrent access to object replicas in Dependency Graph (DG) states -- the common underlying structure of 3D design systems. Prior work has provided an Operational Transformation (OT) solution to dependency-conflict resolution, assuming dependency-conflict can be detected. But dependency-conflict detection is a complex and challenging issue because dependency relations among targets of concurrent operations -- a necessary condition for dependency-conflict -- is dynamic in nature and the detection must refer to prior DG states that are often unavailable during dependency-conflict detection. Conflict detection was never a difficult issue in prior OT work based on well-defined linear data models because conflict relations are readily derivable from operation position parameters without having to refer to prior document states. This work is the first to recognize and solve the dependency-conflict detection problem, which complements prior work in dependency-conflict resolution to provide a complete solution to dependency-conflict problem in real-time collaborative DG-based systems. Both theoretical verification and real implementation have been applied to validate the proposed dependency-conflict detection solution."

We provide a description of the organization and coordination of work at the clinic where surgery is performed in this process. A key part of the study is the description of a Coordinator role and a fairly rigid workflow system referred to as the Care Chain that is used to help manage interdependencies within the care process."
1303922,14040,9078,Multi-leaf tracking from fluorescence plant videos,2014,"Driven by the plant phenotyping application, this paper proposes a new leaf tracking framework to jointly segment, align and track multiple leaves from fluorescence plant videos. Our framework consists of two steps. First, leaf alignment is applied to one video frame to generate a collection of leaf candidates. Second, we define a set of transformation parameters operated on the leaf candidates in order to optimize the alignment in the subsequent video frame according to an objective function. Gradient descent is employed to solve this optimization problem. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-leaf tracking algorithm is superior to the image-based leaf alignment method in terms of three quantitative metrics."
1596962,14040,507,Demonstration of Qurk: a query processor for humanoperators,2011,"Crowdsourcing technologies such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) service have exploded in popularity in recent years. These services are increasingly used for complex human-reliant data processing tasks, such as labelling a collection of images, combining two sets of images to identify people that appear in both, or extracting sentiment from a corpus of text snippets. There are several challenges in designing a workflow that filters, aggregates, sorts and joins human-generated data sources. Currently, crowdsourcing-based workflows are hand-built, resulting in increasingly complex programs. Additionally, developers must hand-optimize tradeoffs among monetary cost, accuracy, and time to completion of results. These challenges are well-suited to a declarative query interface that allows developers to describe their worflow at a high level and automatically optimizes workflow and tuning parameters. In this demonstration, we will present Qurk, a novel query system that allows human-based processing for relational databases. The audience will interact with the system to build queries and monitor their progress. The audience will also see Qurk from an MTurk user's perspective, and complete several tasks to better understand how a query is processed."
2483018,14040,9896,"The global interaction research initiative at the IT university of Copenhagen, Denmark",2011,"This showcase paper describes the Global Interaction Research Initiative - GIRI - recently inaugurated at the IT University of Copenhagen. It presents the motivation for this initiative, namely that the use of information technology is the core enabling factor for global collaboration and business. We argue that there is a fundamental need for understanding and providing next generation technologies for this ultra large-scale interaction paradigm. GIRI is organized around a set of research themes and projects, focusing on different application areas. Themes and projects are loosely coupled in the sense that each research project is defined in its own right with a specific set of challenges, vision, approach, partners, and funding scheme. At the time of writing, GIRI has 3 research themes and are hosting 6 projects, but these numbers are expected to increase as GIRI grows. GIRI is an open research initiative, and we invite other researchers to join."
2459223,14040,9896,Shared decision making needs a communication record,2013,"Increasing dependability in collaboration work among health professionals will directly improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs. Our research examines the development of a shared visual display to facilitate data entry and validation of an electronic record during multidisciplinary team meeting discussion, where specialists discuss patient symptoms, test results, and image findings. The problem of generating an electronic record for patient files that will serve as a record of collaboration, communication and a guide for later tasks is addressed through use of the shared visual display. Shortcomings in user-informed designed, structured data-entry screens became evident when in actual use. Time constraints prompt the synopsis of discussion in acronyms, free text, abbreviations, and the use of inferences. We demonstrate how common ground, team cohesiveness and the use of a shared visual display can improve dependability, but these factors can also provide a false sense of security and increase vulnerability in the patient management system."
1807856,14040,9896,Crowd vs. crowd: large-scale cooperative design through open team competition,2013,"Following the recent remarkable successes of crowdsourcing, there have been attempts to apply it to design. However a design problem is often too complex and difficult to break down into simpler, distributable tasks as required by the conventional crowdsourcing model. In this paper, we present Crowd vs. Crowd (CvC), a novel design crowdsourcing method, where several design teams made up of designers and crowd compete with each other. In each team, a designer coordinates effective communication between the crowd members and takes responsibility for the final design output, and the crowd contributes at different stages of design. We conducted an initial evaluation of CvC in comparison with other collaborative design methods, and found that: CvC can attract more people to participate; the crowd can make useful contribution in CvC; CvC can produce competent design outputs. We then applied CvC to two real-life design problems: first, designing a new logo for a university department; second, for a small tech company. With quantitative and qualitative analyses on these applications, we observed that the elements of competition and collaboration helped to sustain the crowd's motivation to participate, and to produce quality design outcomes with higher level of satisfaction for the stakeholders."
2088791,14040,9896,"Back and forth, back and forth: channel switching in romantic couple conflict",2013,"This work explores the act of channel switching, or switching between forms of face-to-face (FtF) and mediated communication (e.g., text messaging, instant messaging) during romantic couple conflict. Interviews were conducted with 24 individuals currently involved in a non-cohabitating romantic dating relationship of 3 months or longer. Results revealed that many patterns of channel switching are used during conflict, including switches from mediated to FtF communication and from FtF to mediated communication. In addition, participants had a number of interpersonal motivations for initiating a channel switch, including avoiding conflict escalation, managing one's emotions, and attempting to reach a resolution. Theoretical and design implications are discussed."
1782305,14040,9896,Effectiveness of shared leadership in online communities,2012,"Traditional research on leadership in online communities has consistently focused on the small set of people occupying leadership roles. In this paper, we use a model of shared leadership, which posits that leadership behaviors come from members at all levels, not simply from people in high-level leadership positions. Although every member can exhibit some leadership behavior, different types of leadership behavior performed by different types of leaders may not be equally effective. This paper investigates how distinct types of leadership behaviors (transactional, aversive, directive and person-focused) and the legitimacy of the people who deliver them (people in formal leadership positions or not) influence the contributions that other participants make in the context of Wikipedia. After using propensity score matching to control for potential pre-existing differences among those who were and were not targets of leadership behaviors, we found that 1) leadership behaviors performed by members at all levels significantly influenced other members' motivation; 2) transactional leadership and person-focused leadership were effective in motivating others to contribute more, whereas aversive leadership decreased other contributors' motivations; and 3) legitimate leaders were in general more influential than regular peer leaders. We discuss the theoretical and practical implication of our work."
2443236,14040,9896,"Recommending routes in the context of bicycling: algorithms, evaluation, and the value of personalization",2012,"Users have come to rely on automated route finding services for driving, public transit, walking, and bicycling. Current state of the art route finding algorithms typically rely on objective factors like time and distance; they do not consider subjective preferences that also influence route quality. This paper addresses that need. We introduce a new framework for evaluating edge rating prediction techniques in transportation networks and use it to explore ten families of prediction algorithms in Cyclopath, a geographic wiki that provides route finding services for bicyclists. Overall, we find that personalized algorithms predict more accurately than non-personalized ones, and we identify two algorithms with low error and excellent coverage, one of which is simple enough to be implemented in thin clients like web browsers. These results suggest that routing systems can generate better routes by collecting and analyzing users' subjective preferences."

However, spreadsheets are difficult to integrate with other data sources. Converting spreadsheet data to the relational model would allow data analysts to use relational integration tools. We propose a two-phase semiautomatic system that extracts accurate relational metadata while minimizing user effort. Based on an undirected graphical model, our system enables downstream spreadsheet integration applications. First, the automatic extractor uses hints from spreadsheets' graphical style and recovered metadata to extract the spreadsheet data as accurately as possible. Second, the interactive repair identifies similar regions in distinct spreadsheets scattered across large spreadsheet corpora, allowing a user's single manual repair to be amortized over many possible extraction errors. Our experiments show that a human can obtain the accurate extraction with just 31% of the manual operations required by a standard classification based technique on two real-world datasets."
2265838,14040,9896,Motivating contribution in a participatory sensing system via quid-pro-quo,2014,"Participatory sensing systems (PSS) require frequent injection of information that has a short shelf-life. The use of crowds to gather information for PSS is therefore particularly challenging. In this study, we explore the impact of two policies on user contributions. A quid-pro-quo policy exchanges contributions from users for access to critical information in the system. A request policy simply reminds the user that information is needed to make the system function well. Prior research has shown that request for help in crowdsourced system is an effective mechanism to increase contributions. During a large-scale experimental study within a publicly deployed, crowdsourced, transit information system, we analyzed metrics associated with frequency of contribution and commitment to long-term use over a 10-month period. Our results confirmed that quid-pro-quo led to more contribution, but at a cost of faster departure from the study. When a participant was simply requested to contribute, but could still access community-generated data if they ignored a request, was largely ineffective and was statistically similar to the control condition where no request for contribution occurred. Thus crowdsource system designers should consider imposing quid-pro-quo type policies for PSS that concentrate on fewer users, but makes them more productive."
1153178,14040,8927,Customized tour recommendations in urban areas,2014,"The ever-increasing urbanization coupled with the unprecedented capacity to collect and process large amounts of data have helped to create the vision of intelligent urban environments. One key aspect of such environments is that they allow people to effectively navigate through their city. While GPS technology and route-planning services have undoubtedly helped towards this direction, there is room for improvement in intelligent urban navigation. This vision can be fostered by the proliferation of location-based social networks, such as Foursquare or Path, which record the physical presence of users in different venues through check-ins. This information can then be used to enhance intelligent urban navigation, by generating customized path recommendations for users.   In this paper, we focus on the problem of recommending customized tours in urban settings. These tours are generated so that they consider (a) the different types of venues that the user wants to visit, as well as the order in which the user wants to visit them, (b) limitations on the time to be spent or distance to be covered, and (c) the merit of visiting the included venues. We capture these requirements in a generic definition that we refer to as the TourRec problem. We then introduce two instances of the TourRec problem, study their complexity, and propose efficient algorithmic solutions. Our experiments on real data collected from Foursquare demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms and the practical utility of the reported recommendations."
2060927,14040,9896,Innovation cockpit: a dashboard for facilitators in idea management,2012,"We present the design of a dashboard for facilitators in Idea Management Systems (IMS), an emerging class of collaborative software for business organizations or local geographic communities. In these systems, users can generate, share, judge, refine, and select ideas as part of a grassroots process. However, a class of users that lacks adequate support in current IMS are the facilitators. Their role is to help the best ideas to emerge and grow, while balancing the judgments of the crowd with those of the managers or the community leaders. We show how the dashboard helps facilitators in making more efficient and effective decisions in situations where the selection and judgment become prohibitively lengthy and time consuming."
1954946,14040,9896,Bon voyage: social travel planning in the enterprise,2012,"A proliferation of travel-related web sites enable people to share their travel plans, review hotels, offer advice, and more. In this paper we study social travel planning in the enterprise. While business travelers and leisure travelers have different preferences and needs, employees may benefit from sharing information and travel plans within the enterprise. We present a study collecting the requirements for social travel from employees, detail the design principles of a social travel application in the enterprise, and present Voyage, the outcome. We evaluated Voyage based on qualitative and quantitative data and discuss the results using four perspectives: collaborative activities, social information impact, usage patterns, and sharing behavior. Employees expressed their growing satisfaction from the social information contributed by fellow employees. Moreover, we observed that Voyage shortens the reservation time, thus saving costs for the enterprise."
2439683,14040,9896,Photos for documentation and communication in early childhood,2013,"Photos are important for a wide variety of documentation purposes, and they play a special role in documenting physical, cognitive, and social changes in young children. This research focuses on the use of photos as evidence of development in preschool children and as a communication medium for current and future interactions. Through field observations and interviews we analyze the use of photos in the process of developing a detailed portfolio of early childhood development. From the moment of capture to selection, analysis, and sharing, teachers carefully employ the properties of photos to construct and communicate evidence of development. We describe current photo documentation practices and propose a new system to enhance these practices."
1551128,14040,9896,Predicting length of membership in online community everything2 using feedback,2012,"In this paper, we examine how specific features of participation and feedback can predict the length of membership within a user generated content based online community called 'Everything2'. Examining almost 10 years of server data we found that not all feedback is the same: feedback on the user's initial contribution was the strongest factor explaining membership length. Receiving one negative initial feedback did not significantly affect membership, but sequential negative initial feedback decreased the likelihood of staying longer on the site."
1013707,14040,9078,Region-based depth-preserving stereoscopic image retargeting,2014,"The popularity of stereo images and various sizes of display screens pose the need of stereo image retargeting techniques which resize stereo image pairs to desired sizes. Many content-aware stereo image retargeting methods adapt the images through non-uniformly resizing regions. However, these methods often make the depth of retargeted version inconsistent with the original one, since they do not explicitly consider different effects of resizing distinct regions on the depths of 3D scenes. In this paper, we analyze the effects of region-wise resizing on the depths of 3D scenes. With such insights, we can properly edit or maintain the depth of a stereo image pair via region-wise resizing. In addition, by taking into account the effects on different regions, we propose a grid-based retargeting model for stereo images, which simultaneously preserve the depths of 3D scenes and the shapes of salient objects. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method."
756988,14040,422,Leveraging user libraries to bootstrap collaborative filtering,2014,"We introduce a novel graphical model, the collaborative score topic model (CSTM), for personal recommendations of textual documents. CSTM's chief novelty lies in its learned model of individual libraries, or sets of documents, associated with each user. Overall, CSTM is a joint directed probabilistic model of user-item scores (ratings), and the textual side information in the user libraries and the items. Creating a generative description of scores and the text allows CSTM to perform well in a wide variety of data regimes, smoothly combining the side information with observed ratings as the number of ratings available for a given user ranges from none to many. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate CSTM's performance. We further demonstrate its utility in an application for personal recommendations of posters which we deployed at the NIPS 2013 conference."

In addition, the contest drew interest by introducing a number of scientific and technical challenges including dataset size, hierarchical structure of items, high resolution timestamps of ratings, and a non-conventional ranking-based task.#R##N##R##N#This paper provides the organizers' account of the contest, including: a detailed analysis of the datasets, discussion of the contest goals and actual conduct, and lessons learned throughout the contest."
2436494,14040,9896,Contact stratification and deception: blackberry messenger versus SMS use among students,2011,"The proliferation of communication technology has led to potential stratification of contacts across different media, which has important implications for interpersonal dynamics, such as deception. The present study examines how two text-based communication media, BBM and SMS, involve different kinds of social contact networks, and how these differences lead to changes in the frequency and nature of lies. The results reveal that BBM social contacts are relationally closer and include more friends but fewer family and acquaintances than SMS. More deception was also observed in BBM, which included more lies about managing social interactions. The results have important implications for the impact of design features, such as PIN exchange, in text messaging."
60246,14040,8231,HOSLIM: Higher-Order Sparse LInear Method for Top-N Recommender Systems,2014,"Current top-N recommendation methods compute the rec- ommendations by taking into account only relations between pairs of items, thus leading to potential unused information when higher-order re- lations between the items exist. Past attempts to incorporate the higher-order information were done in the context of neighborhood-based methods. However, in many datasets, they did not lead to significant improvements in the recommendation quality. We developed a top-N recommendation method that revisits the issue of higher-order relations, in the context of the model-based Sparse LInear Method (SLIM). The approach followed (Higher-Order Sparse LInear Method, or HOSLIM) learns two sparse aggregation coefficient matrices S and S that cap- ture the item-item and itemset-item similarities, respectively. Matrix S allows HOSLIM to capture higher-order relations, whose complexity is determined by the length of the itemset. Following the spirit of SLIM, matrices S and S are estimated using an elastic net formulation, which promotes model sparsity. We conducted extensive experiments which show that higher-order interactions exist in real datasets and when in- corporated in the HOSLIM framework, the recommendations made are improved. The experimental results show that the greater the presence of higher-order relations, the more substantial the improvement in rec- ommendation quality is, over the best existing methods. In addition, our experiments show that the performance of HOSLIM remains good when we select S such that its number of nonzeros is comparable toS ,w hich reduces the time required to compute the recommendations."
2685830,14040,8231,Twin Bridge Transfer Learning for Sparse Collaborative Filtering,2013,"Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely applied in recommender systems. However, the sparsity issue is still a crucial bottleneck for most existing CF methods. Although target data are extremely sparse for a newly-built CF system, some dense auxiliary data may already exist in othermaturedrelateddomains.Inthispaper,weproposeanovelapproach, TwinBridgeTransfer Learning (TBT), to address thesparse collaborative filtering problem. TBT reduces the sparsity in target data by transferring knowledge from dense auxiliary data through two paths: 1) the latent fac- tors of users and items learned from two dense auxiliary domains, and 2) the similarity graphs of users and items constructed from the learned la- tent factors. These two paths act as a twin bridge to allow more knowledge transferred across domains to reduce the sparsity of target data. Exper- iments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TBT approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CF methods."
1963538,14040,9896,A production monitoring and data processing system for the textile enterprise based on multi-Agent,2011,"According to actual requirements of the textile enterprise, a production management structure model based on multi-Agent is proposed by using the multi-Agent technology, relationship model, decision theory and expert system. Then, through comparing the existing information management system, the advantages of the system is also reflected, and the functional structure model of the system is optimized. Third, a flexible, dynamic, efficient collaboration management platform is designed. As verified by real application, production management and decision model based on multi-Agent strengthens the interactivity role both the user and the system, meets the requirements of the production management, intelligent decision and personalized service, and promotes the informatization development of production management of the textile enterprise."
1123142,14040,8806,Preference-oriented QoS-based service discovery with dynamic trust and reputation management,2012,"In the presence of a variety of service providers that offer web services with overlapping or identical functionality, service consumers need a mechanism to distinguish one service from another based on their own subjective quality of service (QoS) preferences. Typical approaches in this field rely on trusted third parties to monitor the behaviour of service providers and endorse their performance based on their delivered services to different users. However, the issue of evaluating the credibility of user reports is one of the essential problems yet to be solved in the e-Business application area. In this paper we propose a two-layered preference-oriented service selection framework that integrates trust and reputation management techniques with an advanced procurement auction model in order to choose the most pertinent service provider that meets a consumer's QoS requirements. We will give a formal description of our approach and validate it with experiments demonstrating that our solution yields high-quality results under various realistic circumstances."
1790279,14040,9896,"A Review of 25 Years of CSCW Research in Healthcare: Contributions, Challenges and Future Agendas",2013,"CSCW as a field has been concerned since its early days with healthcare, studying how healthcare work is collaboratively and practically achieved and designing systems to support that work. Reviewing literature from the CSCW Journal and related conferences where CSCW work is published, we reflect on the contributions that have emerged from this work. The analysis illustrates a rich range of concepts and findings towards understanding the work of healthcare but the work on the larger policy level is lacking. We argue that this presents a number of challenges for CSCW research moving forward: in having a greater impact on larger-scale health IT projects; broadening the scope of settings and perspectives that are studied; and reflecting on the relevance of the traditional methods in this field - namely workplace studies - to meet these challenges."
1107423,14040,9773,Using Confusion Reject to Improve (User and) System (Cross) Learning of Gesture Commands,2013,"This paper presents a new method to help users defining personalized gesture commands (on pen-based devices) that maximize recognition performance from the classifier. The use of gesture commands give rise to a cross-learning situation where the user has to learn and memorize the command gestures and the classifier has to learn and recognize drawn gestures. The classification task associated with the use of customized gesture commands is complex because the classifier only has very few samples per class to start learning from. We thus need an evolving recognition system that can start from scratch or very few data samples and that will learn incrementally to achieve good performance after some using time. Our objective is to make the user aware of the recognizer difficulties during the definition of commands, by detecting confusion among gesture classes, in order to help him define a gesture set that yield good recognition performance from the beginning. To detect confusing classes we apply confusion reject principles to our evolving recognizer, which is based on a first order fuzzy inference system. A realistic experiment has been made on 55 persons to validate our confusion detection technique, and it shows that our method leads to a significant improvement of the classifier recognition performance."
1271127,14040,9713,Personalized trip recommendation with multiple constraints by mining user check-in behaviors,2012,"In recent years, researches on travel recommendation have attracted extensive attentions due to the wide applications. Among them, one of the active topics is constraint-based trip recommendation for meeting user's personal requirements. Although a number of studies on this topic have been proposed in literatures, most of them only regard the user-specific constraints as some filtering conditions for planning the trip. In fact, immersing the constraints into travel recommendation systems to provide a personalized trip is desired for users. Furthermore, time complexity of trip planning from a set of attractions is sensitive to the scalability of travel regions. Hence, how to reduce the computational cost by parallel cloud computing techniques is also a critical issue. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named  Personalized Trip Recommendation  ( PTR ) to efficiently recommend the personalized trips meeting multiple constraints of users by mining user's check-in behaviors. In  PTR , a mining-based module is first proposed to estimate the scores of attractions by considering both of user-based preferences and temporal-based properties. Then, a trip planning algorithm named  Parallel Trip-Mine  +  is proposed to efficiently plan the trip that satisfies multiple user-specific constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on travel recommendation that considers the issues of multiple constraints, social relationship, temporal property and parallel computing simultaneously. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations on a real check-in dataset obtained from  Gowalla, PTR  is shown to deliver excellent performance."
1553096,14040,9896,Operational transformation for dependency conflict resolution in real-time collaborative 3D design systems,2012,"Conflict resolution is one major challenge in real-time distributed collaborative 3D design systems, which allow concurrent collaborative work on shared 3D documents. Operational Transformation (OT) is a core conflict resolution technique in a range of real-world collaborative systems. No existing OT technique is, however, capable of resolving conflicts among objects with dependency relations, i.e. an update of one object may propagate to other connected/dependent objects, which is commonly used in 3D or complex graphic design systems. This paper contributes a novel OT solution with such a capability for collaborative 3D design systems. This work is the first to extend OT capability to dependency conflict resolution, and OT application scope from 1D/2D to 3D applications, thus advancing the state-of-the-art of OT in both theory and practical application. The proposed solution has been theoretically verified for its correctness in detecting dependency conflicts and achieving consistent results, and implemented in the CoMaya collaborative design system."
1931178,14040,9896,SELECT * FROM USER: infrastructure and socio-technical representation,2011,"As use of, and experiences with, social media continue to grow, the systems of representation that underlie their use become increasingly influential. In this paper, we present results from empirical studies of two online communities-Facebook and craigslist Missed Connections-that highlight the ways in which this underlying infrastructure and the user practices on these sites are inherently intertwined. We make particular use of a framework first introduced by Agre that focuses on the influence of eight underlying features of computing practice: ontology, standards, instrumentation, authentication, interpretation, selection, bias, and performance. The results of this analysis indicate how representational systems do more than simply represent the physical world; they are deeply intertwined with the social and material practices of everyday life."

The Basic Human Values, a motivational construct that captures people's values, have been shown to influence a wide range of human behaviors. In this work, we analyze people's values and their word use on Reddit, an online social news sharing community. Through conducting surveys and analyzing text contributions of 799 Reddit users, we identify and interpret categories of words that are indicative of user's value orientations. Using the same data, we further report a preliminary exploration on word-based prediction of Basic Human Values."
1812988,14040,9896,Dynamic changes in motivation in collaborative citizen-science projects,2012,"Online citizen science projects engage volunteers in collecting, analyzing, and curating scientific data. Existing projects have demonstrated the value of using volunteers to collect data, but few projects have reached the full collaborative potential of scientists and volunteers. Understanding the shared and unique motivations of these two groups can help designers establish the technical and social infrastructures needed to promote effective partnerships. We present findings from a study of the motivational factors affecting participation in ecological citizen science projects. We show that volunteers are motivated by a complex framework of factors that dynamically change throughout their cycle of work on scientific projects; this motivational framework is strongly affected by personal interests as well as external factors such as attribution and acknowledgment. Identifying the pivotal points of motivational shift and addressing them in the design of citizen-science systems will facilitate improved collaboration between scientists and volunteers."
1128372,14040,8927,Adaptive bootstrapping of recommender systems using decision trees,2011,"Recommender systems perform much better on users for which they have more information. This gives rise to a problem of satisfying users new to a system. The problem is even more acute considering that some of these hard to profile new users judge the unfamiliar system by its ability to immediately provide them with satisfying recommendations, and may quickly abandon the system when disappointed. Rapid profiling of new users by a recommender system is often achieved through a bootstrapping process - a kind of an initial interview - that elicits users to provide their opinions on certain carefully chosen items or categories. The elicitation process becomes particularly effective when adapted to users' responses, making best use of users' time by dynamically modifying the questions to improve the evolving profile. In particular, we advocate a specialized version of decision trees as the most appropriate tool for this task. We detail an efficient tree learning algorithm, specifically tailored to the unique properties of the problem. Several extensions to the tree construction are also introduced, which enhance the efficiency and utility of the method. We implemented our methods within a movie recommendation service. The experimental study delivered encouraging results, with the tree-based bootstrapping process significantly outperforming previous approaches."
1541206,14040,422,Accelerated singular value thresholding for matrix completion,2012,"Recovering a large matrix from a small subset of its entries is a challenging problem arising in many real world applications, such as recommender system and image in-painting. These problems can be formulated as a general matrix completion problem. The Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) algorithm is a simple and efficient first-order matrix completion method to recover the missing values when the original data matrix is of low rank. SVT has been applied successfully in many applications. However, SVT is computationally expensive when the size of the data matrix is large, which significantly limits its applicability. In this paper, we propose an Accelerated Singular Value Thresholding (ASVT) algorithm which improves the convergence rate from O(1/N) for SVT to O(1/N 2 ), where  N  is the number of iterations during optimization. Specifically, the dual problem of the nuclear norm minimization problem is derived and an adaptive line search scheme is introduced to solve this dual problem. Consequently, the optimal solution of the primary problem can be readily obtained from that of the dual problem. We have conducted a series of experiments on a synthetic dataset, a distance matrix dataset and a large movie rating dataset. The experimental results have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
2448783,14040,9896,Finding a new normal: the role of technology in life disruptions,2012,"In recent years, the HCI and CSCW communities have begun to examine the role technology plays in personal, rather than professional settings. Part of this work has begun to address a specific class of life events that are unpredictable, uncontrollable, and destabilizing - what we refer to as  life disruptions . While each disruption is unique, we find that patterns of social and technical reconfigurations occur in a variety of different contexts. Drawing on three case studies of severe life disruptions - intimate partner violence, homelessness, and death - we remark on the ways that life disruptions prompt a journey towards a new normal. We enumerate the common lessons learned among our case studies and seek to inform future technology research and design work which may involve life disruptions."

Drawing from this success, we are exploring the use of an online community to build a support group for parents currently in receipt of income support but needing to transition to find a job. Complementing the financial and informational support offered through existing welfare transition programs, our work aims to help people improve their prospect of finding a job to become financially self-sufficient and develop a support network to help them in their transition back to work.

1870569,14040,9896,A study of multilingual social tagging of art images: cultural bridges and diversity,2012,"The goal of this study is to compare social tagging patterns in two languages in image collections of art, while seeking exploitable strengths for the application of multilingual social tagging in digital libraries and museums. Crowdsourcing the annotation of digital image collections of artworks to different language communities has the potential to bridge language borders and reach wider audiences. This mixed methods study is based on a collection of digital images of paintings for which tags in Spanish and English were collected. The results show that the level of agreement in the vocabulary describing an image does not change significantly when adding a second language, but different cultural perspectives can be found for certain images when comparing less frequent tags across languages. Understanding and comparing tagging behaviors across languages is necessary for the design of user interfaces that support diversity and encourage sharing of perspectives about the artwork images."
2327515,14040,8235,CompRec-Trip: A composite recommendation system for travel planning,2011,"Classical recommender systems provide users with a list of recommendations where each recommendation consists of a single item, e.g., a book or a DVD. However, applications such as travel planning can benefit from a system capable of recommending packages of items, under a user-specified budget and in the form of sets or sequences. In this context, there is a need for a system that can recommend top-k packages for the user to choose from. In this paper, we propose a novel system, CompRec-Trip, which can automatically generate composite recommendations for travel planning. The system leverages rating information from underlying recommender systems, allows flexible package configuration and incorporates users' cost budgets on both time and money. Furthermore, the proposed CompRec-Trip system has a rich graphical user interface which allows users to customize the returned composite recommendations and take into account external local information."
2349201,14040,9896,SketchComm: a tool to support rich and flexible asynchronous communication of early design ideas,2012,"When designers explain their early design ideas to others, they usually use face-to-face communication along with sketches. In practice, however, sometimes face-to-face meetings are not possible, and designers have to rely on asynchronous communication. Important contextual information that is available in face-to-face meetings often becomes missing in such asynchronous communications, which can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. To address this challenge, we present SketchComm: an enhanced tool to support rich and flexible asynchronous communication of early design ideas. The key of the system is to allow designers to capture and communicate important contextual information to the audience in addition to sketches. A user study with designers and audience demonstrated effectiveness of asynchronous early design communication using SketchComm."
2078416,14040,9896,Social coding in GitHub: transparency and collaboration in an open software repository,2012,"Social applications on the web let users track and follow the activities of a large number of others regardless of location or affiliation. There is a potential for this transparency to radically improve collaboration and learning in complex knowledge-based activities. Based on a series of in-depth interviews with central and peripheral GitHub users, we examined the value of transparency for large-scale distributed collaborations and communities of practice. We find that people make a surprisingly rich set of social inferences from the networked activity information in GitHub, such as inferring someone else's technical goals and vision when they edit code, or guessing which of several similar projects has the best chance of thriving in the long term. Users combine these inferences into effective strategies for coordinating work, advancing technical skills and managing their reputation."
1700083,14040,9896,Collaborative rhythm: temporal dissonance and alignment in collaborative scientific work,2011,"CSCW studies of large-scale distributed practice in the sciences and elsewhere have taught us important things about space and place as props and barriers to distributed collective action, but they have had relatively less to say about time. This paper develops a heuristic of collaborative rhythms and points to the work of temporal alignment as a neglected but crucial element underpinning distributed collective practice in the sciences (and other spheres of collective activity). Specifically, we argue that joint scientific work is organized around four separate registers, or 'rhythms' - organizational, infrastructural, biographical, and phenomenal - and that efforts to align such rhythms constitute an important and under-recognized aspect of collaborative work. The ideas and examples are drawn from our own field studies around IT infrastructure and collaborative practice across a range of scientific fields."

More precisely, we consider two sources of information: the leaf margin and the leaf salient points. We investigate two shape context based descriptors: the first one describes the leaf boundary while the second descriptor represents the spatial correlation between salient points of the leaf and its margin. We also study the performance of the fusion of these two descriptors on the Image-CLEF 2011 and 2012 leaf datasets. Experiments show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method."

An extremely accurate motion capture system is proposed to measure and track the user's head motion in 3D space. Video frames captured by the low-cost head-mounted camera are processed to retrieve the 3D motion parameters. The retrieved information facilitates the real-time 3D interaction. This technology turns any 2D screen to interactive 3D display, enabling users to control and manipulate the content as a digital window. The proposed system is tested and verified on a huge wall-sized 4K screen."
1277053,14040,9078,Attentive gesture recognition,2012,"This paper presents a novel method for static gesture recognition based on visual attention. Our proposed method makes use of a visual attention model to automatically select points that correspond to fixation points of the human eye. Gesture recognition is then performed using the determined visual attention fixation points. For this purpose, shape context descriptors are used to compare the sparse fixation points of gestures for classification. Simulation results are presented in order to illustrate the performance of the proposed perceptual-based attentive gesture recognition method. The proposed method not only helps in the development of more natural user-centric interactive interfaces but is also able to achieve a 96.42% classification accuracy on the Triesch database of hand postures, which is superior to other methods presented in the literature."
2227829,14040,9896,Mixing metaphors in mobile remote presence,2012,"Metaphors for making sense of new communication technologies are important for setting user expectations about appropriate use of the technologies. When users do not share a common metaphorical model for using these technologies, interpersonal communication breakdowns can occur. Through a set of three 8-week-long field deployments and one ongoing observation in-house, we conducted contextual inquiries around the uses of a relatively new communication technology, a mobile remote presence (MRP) system. We observed many nonhuman-like metaphors (e.g., orienting toward the system as a robot, an object) and human-like metaphors (e.g., a person, or a person with disabilities). These metaphors influence people's expectations about social norms in using the systems. We found that there is a serious risk of creating interpersonal conflict when the metaphors are mismatched between people (e.g., locals use nonhuman-like metaphors when remote pilots use human-like metaphors). We explore the implications for understanding remote pilots' rights and responsibilities and present design guidelines for MRP systems that support geographically distributed groups."
2057330,14040,9896,Of joy and gender: emotional expression in online social networks,2012,"In this study, we analyzed the language use on Twitter personal exchanges as well as properties of the users' networks, to study the influence of gender composition on expressions of positive emotions while controlling for the strength of connection between the conversing users. Our findings show that compared to men, women express positive emotions more, especially when interacting with other women. Our findings help the understanding of gender-driven communication patterns in social media, and offer insights for the study of emotion and language."
1464425,14040,9704,Hierarchical PSO clustering based recommender system,2012,"Due to a marked increase in the number of web users and their activities, many application areas that use patterns generated from their activities has been proposed. Web-based implicit recommender systems are one such application. An implicit recommender system is a tool that helps guide a user to a particular web resource based on implicit data. Implicit data comes from the web users activities without their active participation. Building such a system is a complex process due to two reasons, there is a huge amount of data and the quality of the data is poor. In this research, we tackle the first problem of generating patterns efficiently for recommender system by proposing Hierarchical Particle Swarm Optimization based clustering (HPSO-clustering). HPSO-clustering is a clustering approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization which combines both the properties of hierarchical and partitional clustering. We grouped the users' session into different clusters. Recommendations for an active user are generated from these clusters. In this paper we report the results of accuracy of recommendations. We achieved an overall 60% to 65% of precision for an active user, while in some clusters the precision achieved was 100% when top 5 ranked recommendations were selected."
1019927,14040,9080,From neighbors to global neighbors in collaborative filtering: an evolutionary optimization approach,2012,"The accuracy of recommendations of collaborative filtering based recommender systems mainly depends on which users (the neighbors) are exploited to estimate a user's ratings. We propose a new approach of neighbor selection, which adopts a global point of view. This approach defines a unique set of possible neighbors, shared by all users, referred to as Global Neighbors ( GN ). We view the problem of defining  GN  as a combinatorial optimization problem and propose to use an evolutionary algorithm to tackle this search. Our aim is to find a relatively small  GN  as the size of the resulting model, as well as the complexity of the computation of recommendations highly depend on the size of  GN . We present experiments and results on a standard benchmark data-set from the recommender system community that support our choice of the evolutionary approach and show that it leads to a high accuracy of recommendations and a high coverage, while dramatically reducing the size of the model (by 84%). We also show that the evolutionary approach produces results able to generate accurate recommendations to unseen users, while easily allowing the insertion of new users in the system with little overhead."
2123570,14040,9896,Trust in virtual teams: theory and tools,2013,"We present a workshop in which trust in virtual teams is the central theme. Trust is essential for effective and efficient collaborations to take place and is more challenging when people are unable to meet face-to-face. The workshop aims to generate discussions which address three key issues within this general theme: 1) the factors that engender and inhibit trust, 2) the structure of a trust framework, 3) and the requirements for software tools that support the development of trust during virtual collaborations."
2269541,14040,9896,Supporting reflective public thought with considerit,2012,"We present a novel platform for supporting public deliberation on difficult decisions. ConsiderIt guides people to reflect on tradeoffs and the perspectives of others by framing interactions around pro/con points that participants create, adopt, and share. ConsiderIt surfaces the most salient pros and cons overall, while also enabling users to drill down into the key points for different groups. We deployed ConsiderIt in a contentious U.S. state election, inviting residents to deliberate on nine ballot measures. We discuss ConsiderIt's affordances and limitations, enriched with empirical data from this deployment. We show that users often engaged in normatively desirable activities, such as crafting positions that recognize both pros and cons, as well as points written by people who do not agree with them."

Inspired by citizen sciences, our aim is to speed up the collection and integration of raw botanical observation data, while providing to potential users an easy and efficient access to this botanical knowledge. The result presented during the demo is an enjoying application where anyone can play to shoot fresh cut leaves and observe the relevance of species suggested in spite of various visual difficult queries."
1705914,14040,9896,Virtually dining together in time-shifted environment: KIZUNA design,2013,"Dining with a remote person requires that both participants are available at the same time to eat together. Because of time-zone differences and other such contingent factors, this condition can often be hard to fulfill. One solution may lie in time-shifted communication. A person can enjoy a meal while watching an earlier recorded video of a remote person's dining. However, in a time-shifted environment, achieving dining synchronization is a challenge. In this research, we propose a time-shifted tele-dining system (KIZUNA) enabling people to enjoy a meal together in a virtual environment. The system adapts the displayed video's playback speed to the difference in dining progress between the local and remote person. This is likely to enhance communication and increase enjoyment while dining. A validation experiment revealed that the proposed KIZUNA adaptation method enhanced diners' communication behavior, and significantly enhanced the perceived presence of the remote person, in comparison with conventional time-shifted tele-dining. This result suggests a promising future for the KIZUNA system."
2230461,14040,9896,Using F-formations to analyse spatial patterns of interaction in physical environments,2011,"There are few conceptual tools available to analyse physical spaces in terms of their support for social interactions and their potential for technological augmentation. In this paper, we describe how we used Adam Kendon's characterisation of the F-formation system of spatial organisation as a conceptual lens to analyse the social interactions between visitors and staff in a tourist information centre. We describe how the physical structures in the space encouraged and discouraged particular kinds of interactions and discuss how F-formations might be used to think about augmenting physical spaces."
2481880,14040,9896,Representation and communication: challenges in interpreting large social media datasets,2013,"Online services provide a range of opportunities for understanding human behaviour through the large aggregate data sets that their operation collects. Yet the data sets they collect do not unproblematically model or mirror the world events. In this paper we use data from Foursquare, a popular location check-in service, to argue for the importance of analysing social media as a communicative rather than representational system. Drawing on logs of all Foursquare check-ins over eight weeks we highlight four features of Foursquare's use: the relationship between attendance and check-ins, event check-ins, commercial incentives to check-in, and lastly humorous check-ins These points show how large data analysis is affected by the end user uses to which social networks are put."
2504409,14040,9896,Achieve: evaluating the impact of progress logging and social feedback on goal achievement,2014,"Goal progress logging and social feedback have been shown to motivate individuals to achieve their goals. However, little controlled study has been done to evaluate the relative effects of these features. We developed a simple goal achievement application, Achieve, to examine the effects of progress logging and social feedback on goal completion. Results of an in-progress study suggest that both progress logging and social feedback had positive effects on goal completion. However, surprisingly, social feedback has no significant advantage over progress logging. Further, participants who gave and received social feedback had a higher level of annoyance toward the study. We discuss possible reasons for this and propose insights for adding social components to goal achievement systems."
1539260,14040,9099,A Multi-Touch DJ Interface with Remote Audience Feedback,2014,"Current DJ interfaces lack direct support for typical digital communication common in social media. We present a novel DJ interface for live internet broadcast performances with remote audience feedback integration. Our multi-touch interface is designed for a table top display, featuring a time-line based visualization. Two studies are presented involving seven DJs, culminating in four live broadcasts gathering and analyzing data to better understand both the DJ and audience perspective. This study is one of the first to look closer at DJs and remote audiences. We present useful insight for future interaction design between DJs and remote audiences, and interface integrated audience feedback."
1653743,14040,9099,From Writing to Painting: A Kinect-Based Cross-Modal Chinese Painting Generation System,2014,"As computer and interaction technologies mature, a much broader range of media is now used for input and output, each of which has its own rich repertoire of techniques, instruments, and cultural heritage. The combination of multiple media can produce novel multimedia human-computer interaction approaches which are more efficient and interesting than traditional single media methods. This paper presents CalliPaint, a system for cross-modal art generation that links together Chinese ink brush calligraphy writing and Chinese landscape painting. We investigate the mapping between the two modalities based on concepts of metaphoric congruence, and implement our findings into a prototype system. A multi-step evaluation experiment with real users suggests that CalliPaint provides a realistic and intuitive experience that allows even novice users to create attractive landscape paintings from writing. Comparison with a general-purpose digital painting software suggests that CalliPaint provides users with a more enjoyable experience. Finally, exhibiting CalliPaint in an open-access location for use by casual users without any training shows that the system is easy to learn."
1448467,14040,8806,Interactive coffee table for exploration of personal photos and videos,2013,"Interactive tabletops offer a unique opportunity for exploring home videos and photos. Nevertheless, there are still a number of unexplored challenges for effectively providing support for collocated group interaction around media. This paper reports on a user study involving 24 users, intended to better understanding the challenges ahead. Our volunteers (in couples) evaluated our media sharing application prototype, providing valuable feedback with regards to three key challenges: metaphor, digital ecosystem, and level of control. First, users appreciated the selected metaphor of physical photos, but without relinquishing software support, such as alignment and distribution of media items. Second, vertical auxiliary screens helped in supporting a bigger number of users and providing more comfort and a better viewing angle and stance. Third, the nature of the task (either storytelling or random exploration) had a strong influence on the control capabilities to be provided by the application. Fourth, personal spaces within the tabletop were useful for allowing independent navigation. We consider these results as relevant for the future developments of home media sharing applications for the living room."
1504964,14040,9475,Temperature-based Model-Predictive Cascade Mitigation in Electric Power Systems,2013,"This paper proposes a novel model-predictive control scheme which combines both economic and security objectives to mitigate the effects of severe disturbances in electrical power systems. A linear convex relaxation of the AC power flow is employed to model transmission line losses and conductor temperatures. Then, a receding-horizon model predictive control (MPC) strategy is developed to alleviate line temperature overloads and prevent the propagation of outages. The MPC strategy seeks to alleviate temperature overloads by rescheduling generation, energy storage and other network elements, subject to ramp-rate limits and network limitations. The MPC strategy is illustrated with simulations of the IEEE RTS-96 network augmented with energy storage and renewable generation."
2538522,14040,8960,Incremental Clustering: The Case for Extra Clusters,2014,"The explosion in the amount of data available for analysis often necessitates a transition from batch to incremental clustering methods, which process one element at a time and typically store only a small subset of the data. In this paper, we initiate the formal analysis of incremental clustering methods focusing on the types of cluster structure that they are able to detect. We find that the incremental setting is strictly weaker than the batch model, proving that a fundamental class of cluster structures that can readily be detected in the batch setting is impossible to identify using any incremental method. Furthermore, we show how the limitations of incremental clustering can be overcome by allowing additional clusters."
2414589,14040,65,A dual-layer user model based cognitive system for user-adaptive service robots,2011,"This paper proposes a dual-layer user model to generate descriptive service recommendations for user-adaptive service robots. The user model represents user preferences as the associative memory in the bottom-layer and association rules in the top-layer. The learning and inference processes in the two layers, and the bottom-up rule extraction process, are explained. The proposed user model was applied to a user-adaptive coffee menu recommendation system, and the quantitative and qualitative performances of the user-adaptive and descriptive recommendation system were evaluated by comparison with non-descriptive and random recommendation methods."
2473066,14040,9896,It's about time: confronting latency in the development of groupware systems,2011,"The presence of network latency leads to usability problems in distributed groupware applications. Example problems include difficulty synchronizing tightly-coupled collaboration, jarring changes in the user interface following the repair of conflicting operations, and confusion when participants discuss state that appears differently to each of them. Techniques exist that can help mitigate the effects of latency, both in the user interface and the groupware application. However, as these techniques necessitate the manipulation of state over time, the effort required to implement them can be significant. In this paper, we present timelines, a programming model allowing the explicit treatment of time in groupware applications. The model has been implemented as part of the Janus toolkit."
916737,14040,65,Applying key typing pressure to estimate a user's state of activity,2012,"A user working at his/her desktop computer would benefit from notifications being given at timings that reflect their relevancy to the user's activity and workload. To do so correctly, a notification system should have a way of determining the user's state of activity We propose a novel method to estimate user states with a pressure sensor on a desk. We use a lattice-like pressure sensor sheet and distinguish between two simple user states: busy or idle. The pressure can be measured without the user being aware of it, and changes in the pressure reflect useful information like typing, an arm, the presence of a coffee mug, and so on. We carefully developed features which can be extracted from the sensed data and used a machine learning technique to identify the user state. We conducted experiments evaluating the accuracy of our method and obtained promising results."
1209158,14040,9099,CollARt: a tool for creating 3D photo collages using mobile augmented reality,2013,"A collage is an artistic composition made by assembling different parts to create a new whole. This procedure can be applied for assembling tridimensional objects. In this paper we present CollARt, a Mobile Augmented Reality application which permits to create 3D photo collages. Virtual pieces are textured with pictures taken with the camera and can be blended with real objects. A preliminary user study (N=12) revealed that participants were able to create interesting works of art. The evaluation also suggested that the possibility of itinerantly mixing virtual pieces with the real world increases creativity."
1785297,14040,8806,Recommending insurance riders,2013,"Insurance riders are optional addendum to base insurance policies. In this paper we discuss the application of recommender systems to the task of matching riders to clients. This task is difficult because of the variety of possible riders, as well as the poor knowledge of the client over these riders. We focus on call centers where the agent also has limited knowledge and expertise. For such agents, discovering appropriate riders for the current client is very difficult, and automated tools that suggest such riders can play an important role in the agent-client dialogue, and may influence considerably the outcome of the interaction.   This paper presents and discusses in detail the problem of recommending insurance riders to clients in call centers, comparing it to other, classic, recommendation system applications. In addition, we present an analysis of customer purchase behavior, showing that simple item-item recommendation algorithms provide good recommendations for riders given a base policy."
28138,14040,422,Incremental set recommendation based on class differences,2012,"In this paper, we present a set recommendation framework that proposes sets of items, whereas conventional recommendation methods recommend each item independently. Our new approach to the set recommendation framework can propose sets of items on the basis on the user's initially chosen set. In this approach, items are added to or deleted from the initial set so that the modified set matches the target classification. Since the data sets created by the latest applications can be quite large, we use ZDD (Zero-suppressed Binary Decision Diagram) to make the searching more efficient. This framework is applicable to a wide range of applications such as advertising on the Internet and healthy life advice based on personal lifelog data."
1187195,14040,9078,Advanced tree species identification using multiple leaf parts image queries,2013,"There has recently been increasing interest in using advanced computer vision techniques for automatic plant identification. Most of the approaches proposed are based on an analysis of leaf characteristics. Nevertheless, two aspects have still not been well exploited: (1) domain-specific or botanical knowledge (2) the extraction of meaningful and relevant leaf parts. In this paper, we describe a new automated technique for leaf image retrieval that attempts to take these particularities into account. The proposed method is based on local representation of leaf parts. The part-based decomposition is defined and usually used by botanists. The global image query is a combination of part sub-images queries. Experiments carried out on real world leaf images, the Pl@ntLeaves scan images (3070 images totalling 70 species), show an increase in performance compared to global leaf representation."
1700911,14040,8385,Prediction of atomic web services reliability based on k-means clustering,2013,"Contemporary web applications are often designed as composite services built by coordinating atomic services with the aim of providing the appropriate functionality. Although functional properties of each atomic service assure correct functionality of the entire application, nonfunctional properties such as availability, reliability, or security might significantly influence the user-perceived quality of the application. In this paper, we present CLUS, a model for reliability prediction of atomic web services that improves state-of-the-art approaches used in modern recommendation systems. CLUS predicts the reliability for the ongoing service invocation using the data collected from previous invocations. We improve the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art prediction models by considering user-, service- and environment-specific parameters of the invocation context. To address the computational performance related to scalability issues, we aggregate the available previous invocation data using K-means clustering algorithm. We evaluated our model by conducting experiments on services deployed in different regions of the Amazon cloud. The evaluation results suggest that our model improves both performance and accuracy of the prediction when compared to the current state-of-the-art models."
2216462,14040,8960,Automatic Feature Induction for Stagewise Collaborative Filtering,2012,"Recent approaches to collaborative filtering have concentrated on estimating an algebraic or statistical model, and using the model for predicting missing ratings. In this paper we observe that different models have relative advantages in different regions of the input space. This motivates our approach of using stagewise linear combinations of collaborative filtering algorithms, with non-constant combination coefficients based on kernel smoothing. The resulting stagewise model is computationally scalable and outperforms a wide selection of state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms."
1701690,14040,9099,Mixing remote locations using shared screen as virtual stage,2011,"This paper introduces a visual communication system that integrates images displayed on a shared screen and people in front of the screen using depth information obtained from a stereo camera. Conventional video conferencing systems convey PC screen contents and video of local and remote participants in different channels, making interactions among them difficult. The proposed system maps persons in the foreground onto the screen preserving relative position and size. A series of preliminary experiments is conducted to compare the performance of the proposed system against conventional systems."
852076,14040,8806,Stochastic search for global neighbors selection in collaborative filtering,2012,"Neighborhood based collaborative filtering is a popular approach in recommendation systems. In this paper we propose to apply evolutionary computation to reduce the size of the model used for the recommendation. We formulate the problem of constructing the set of neighbors as an optimization problem that we tackle by stochastic local search. The results we present show that our approach produces a set of global neighbors made up of less than 16% of the entire set of users, thus decreases the size of the model by 84%. Furthermore, this reduction leads to a slight increase of the accuracy of a state of the art clustering based approach, without impacting the coverage."
1740654,14040,9896,Nomadic Work: Romance and Reality. A Response to Barbara Czarniawska’s ‘Nomadic Work as Life-Story Plot’,2014,"This article takes departure in Barbara Czarniawska’s discussion of ‘Nomadic Work as Life-Story Plot’. It contextualises her analysis of actors’ interpretations of nomadic work with a bi-focal review of the ambiguous realities of these phenomena. Firstly, an examination of key aspects of the socio-economic and political context of nomadic work in global neoliberal economies reveals precarious conditions that cloud romantic interpretations of nomadicity. Secondly, a review of studies of everyday practices of nomadic work shows how neoliberal, but also alternative futures are enacted through creative appropriation of collaborative technologies. One example is the work of digital ‘disaster deck’ volunteers and its potential for the mobilization of ‘rapid, highly localized assistance’ through closer collaboration between a distributed crowd, local communities, and official emergency responders (Starbird and Palen 2013). This and other examples suggest emergent new practices and politics of dwelling in mobility that are focused on sociality and collaboration, straddling virtual and physical commons. The twin critique developed in this response can augment narrative analysis to inform more integrated CSCW innovation that challenges the ‘brave new world of work’."
2034586,14040,9896,The Egyptian blogosphere: a counter-narrative of the revolution,2012,"In this paper we investigate the role blogs played within the context of the Egyptian revolution of early 2011 using blog data authored between 2004-2011. We conducted topic modeling analysis to gain a longitudinal view of the interaction of societal, personal and revolutionary blog topics over this period. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis of blog posts during the period that bracketed the political uprising revealed Egyptian bloggers' concerns. Reporting events and supplying commentary provided bloggers with a means to voice dissent against institutionalized power represented by the government-controlled media. In short, blogs reveal a counter-narrative to the government-supplied version of events in Egypt during the 18-day uprising. These narratives offer rich documentation of how blogs, and perhaps social media more generally, can be utilized by individuals operating under repressive conditions."
389913,14040,8231,The instance easiness of supervised learning for cluster validity,2011,"The statistical problem of testing cluster validity is essentially unsolved [5]. We translate the issue of gaining credibility on the output of un-supervised learning algorithms to the supervised learning case. We introduce a notion of instance easiness to supervised learning and link the validity of a clustering to how its output constitutes an easy instance for supervised learning. Our notion of instance easiness for supervised learning extends the notion of stability to perturbations (used earlier for measuring clusterability in the un-supervised setting). We follow the axiomatic and generic formulations for cluster-quality measures. As a result, we inform the trust we can place in a clustering result using standard validity methods for supervised learning, like cross validation."
2370817,14040,9896,From Artefacts to Infrastructures,2013,"In their initial articulation of the direction of the CSCW field, scholars advanced an open-ended agenda. This continuing commitment to open-ness to different contexts and approaches is not, however, reflected in the contents of the major CSCW outlets. The field appears to privilege particular forms of cooperative work. We find many examples of what could be described as `localist studies', restricted to particular settings and timeframes. This focus on the `here and now' is particularly problematic when one considers the kinds of large-scale, integrated and interconnected workplace information technologies--or what we are calling Information Infrastructures--increasingly found within and across organisations today. CSCW appears unable (or unwilling) to grapple with these technologies--which were at the outset envisaged as falling within the scope of the field. Our paper hopes to facilitate greater CSCW attention to Information Infrastructures through offering a re-conceptualisation of the role and nature of `design'. Design within an Information Infrastructures perspective needs to accommodate non-local constraints. We discuss two such forms of constraint: standardisation (how local fitting entails unfitting at other sites) and embeddedness (the entanglement of one technology with other apparently unrelated ones). We illustrate these themes through introducing case material drawn on from a number of previous studies."
2152916,14040,9896,Tweeting for class: using social media to enable student co-construction of lectures,2012,"Motivating students to be active in learning is a perennial problem in education. We describe our experience using Twitter for student co-construction of lecture materials. Students were required to tweet prior to each lecture related to that day's topic. These tweets - consisting of questions, examples and reflections - were incorporated into the lecture slides. Students reported that they found lectures including their tweets in class to be engaging, interactive and relevant, and nearly 90% of them recommended we use our co-construction approach again. Future iterations of this model could streamline the process by using automated processing and aggregation of tweets and/or having students in the class responsible for this."
2155588,14040,9896,ReConMUC: adaptable consistency requirements for efficient large-scale multi-user chat,2011,"Multi-user chat (MUC) applications raise serious challenges to developers concerning scalability and efficient use of network bandwidth, due to a large number of users exchanging lots of messages in real-time. We propose a new approach to MUC message propagation based on an adaptable consistency model bounded by three metrics: Filter, Time and Volume. In this model, the server propagates some messages as soon as possible while others are postponed until certain conditions are met, according to each client consistency requirements. These requirements can change during the session lifetime, constantly adapting to each client's current context.   We developed a prototype called ReConMUC (Relaxed Consistency MUC) as an extension to a well-known MUC protocol, which, by attaching a special component to the server, filters messages before they are broadcast, according to client consistency requirements.   The performance results obtained show that ReConMUC effectively reduces the server outbound bandwidth, without significant increase in memory and CPU usage, thus improving scalability."
2557538,14040,8228,Cascading Link Failure in the Power Grid: A Percolation-Based Analysis,2011,"Large-scale power blackouts caused by cascading failure are inflicting enormous socioeconomic costs. We study the problem of cascading link failures in power networks modelled by random geometric graphs from a percolation-based viewpoint. To reflect the fact that links fail according to the amount of power flow going through them, we introduce a model where links fail according to a probability which depends on the number of neighboring links. We devise a mapping which maps links in a random geometric graph to nodes in a corresponding dual covering graph. This mapping enables us to obtain the first-known analytical conditions on the existence and non-existence of a large component of operational links after degree-dependent link failures. Finally, we present a simple but descriptive model for cascading link failure, and use the degree-dependent link failure results to obtain the first-known analytical conditions on the existence and non-existence of cascading link failures."
2481951,14040,9896,The power of the ask in social media,2012,"Social computing and social media systems depend on contributions from users. We posit the existence of a latent demand for contribution: many users want to contribute but don't. We then test a simple interface that can induce these users to actually contribute: we display a popup window asking users to contribute. In a real-world randomized field experiment, we found that asking them to contribute right now is ineffective, but reminding the users to contribute actually leads to approximately a 23% increase in contributions with no reduction in quality. However, this effect wanes as users habituate to the popups."
2346402,14040,9896,"The family room: a multi-camera, multi-display family media space",2014,"The Family Room is a multi-camera, multi-display media space for families. It allows family members to easily share audio and video connections between multiple devices across different households. This is ideal for connecting grandchildren and grandparents for talking, viewing, and sharing activities. The common model used for video chat systems involves people calling one another and accepting or declining invitations. As an alternative, the Family Room uses a room metaphor where each device or location simply needs to join or enter a persistent virtual 'room' in order to share video and audio between locations."
1244746,14040,9099,PaperVideo: interacting with videos on multiple paper-like displays,2012,"Sifting and sense-making of video collections are important tasks in many professions. In contrast to sense-making of paper documents, where physical structuring of many documents has proven to be key to effective work, interaction with video is still restricted to the traditional one video at a time paradigm. This paper investigates how interaction with video can benefit from paper-like displays that allow for working with multiple videos simultaneously in physical space. We present a corresponding approach and system called PaperVideo, including novel interaction concepts for both video and audio. These include spatial techniques for temporal navigation, arranging, grouping and linking of videos, as well as for managing video contents and simultaneous audio playback on multiple displays. An evaluation with users provides insights into how paper-based navigation with videos improves active video work."
2261727,14040,9896,On the perceived interdependence and information sharing inhibitions of enterprise software engineers,2012,"Software teams often have trouble coordinating shared work due to poor communication practices. We surveyed software engineers (N=989) at Microsoft to investigate three rarely explored aspects of coordination: (1) how an engineer's perception of dependence is predicted by his organizational characteristics, (2) how this perception differs when the dependence varies by the kinds of shared work artifacts, and (3) how the work group range affects the likelihood that an engineer will share information about work artifacts with another. Our results indicate that engineers tailor their communications about shared work for each group of intended recipients. This suggests that many existing coordination tools that rely on automatic mining and visualization of engineering activities have prevented senders from controlling the distribution of information about their work, and may have overestimated the receivers' abilities to comprehend it."
1778699,14040,9896,Towards quality discourse in online news comments,2011,"With the growth in sociality and interaction around online news media, news sites are increasingly becoming places for communities to discuss and address common issues spurred by news articles. The quality of online news comments is of importance to news organizations that want to provide a valuable exchange of community ideas and maintain credibility within the community. In this work we examine the complex interplay between the needs and desires of news commenters with the functioning of different journalistic approaches toward managing comment quality. Drawing primarily on newsroom interviews and reader surveys, we characterize the comment discourse of SacBee.com, discuss the relationship of comment quality to both the consumption and production of news information, and provide a description of both readers' and writers' motivations for usage of news comments. We also examine newsroom strategies for dealing with comment quality as well as explore tensions and opportunities for value-sensitive innovation within such online communities."

Based on a Contextual Inquiry (CI) in the cleanroom in a semiconductor factory, we identified the maintainers working routines and their usage patterns with various maintenance devices. In the cleanroom maintainance tools could bridge the physical gap between operators and maintainers. In particular reporting tools should link the information gap. In this paper we will present design implications derived from the CI towards a novel-reporting tool for maintainers to support this cooperation between maintainers and operators in the cleanroom."
924103,14040,369,Evaluation of VeMAC for V2V and V2R Communications under Unbalanced Vehicle Traffic,2012,"A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an emerging technology which has a great potential of new applications in safety, traffic optimization, and entertainment. The VeMAC [1], [2] is a medium access control protocol recently proposed for VANETs, which can support efficient broadcast service necessary for high priority safety applications. The VeMAC protocol reserves disjoint sets of time slots to vehicles moving in opposite directions and to road side units (RSUs). The protocol has been evaluated for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications and under balanced vehicle traffic conditions, in which the densities of vehicles moving in opposite directions on a two-way road are approximately equal [2]. In this paper we investigate the effects of the existence of RSUs and the unbalanced vehicle traffic conditions on the VeMAC performance, via simulations in highway and city scenarios in terms of network throughput and transmission collision rate."

CTPF can be used to build recommender systems by learning from reader histories and content to recommend personalized articles of interest. In detail, CTPF models both reader behavior and article texts with Poisson distributions, connecting the latent topics that represent the texts with the latent preferences that represent the readers. This provides better recommendations than competing methods and gives an interpretable latent space for understanding patterns of readership. Further, we exploit stochastic variational inference to model massive real-world datasets. For example, we can fit CPTF to the full arXiv usage dataset, which contains over 43 million ratings and 42 million word counts, within a day. We demonstrate empirically that our model outperforms several baselines, including the previous state-of-the art approach."
829714,14040,8235,A Stigmergic Guiding System to Facilitate the Group Decision Process,2012,"The paper presents a stigmergic approach to engineer a guiding system to facilitate the complex problem of designing the group decision processes. The system aims to provide contextual, actionable recommendations based on the knowledge and past experience of its users as recorded in a collaborative working environment implemented around the concept of stigmergic systems. Through an agent-based socio-simulation experiment we have demonstrated already the feasibility of this approach. The paper illustrates how the simulation results are transferred into a guiding system that facilitates the group decision process design through iterative queries reformulations for the identification, representation and manipulation of the relevant knowledge."
1897762,14040,9896,Building loyalty to online communities through bond and identity-based attachment to sub-groups,2014,"Researchers and theorists have proposed that feelings of attachment to subgroups within a larger online community or site can increase users' loyalty to the site. They have identified two types of attachment, with distinct causes and consequences. With bond-based attachment, people feel connections to other group members, while with identity-based attachment they feel connections to the group as a whole. In two experiments we show that these feelings of attachment to subgroups increase loyalty to the larger community. Communication with other people in a subgroup but not simple awareness of them increases attachment to the larger community. By varying how the communication is structured, between dyads or with all group members simultaneously, the experiments show that bond- and identity-based attachment have different causes. But the experiments show no evidence that bond and identity attachment have different consequences. We consider both theoretical and methodological reasons why the consequences of bond-based and identity-based attachment are so similar."
2307502,14040,8228,RobuRec: Robust Sybil attack defense in online recommender systems,2013,"With the growth of Internet usage and online social networks, the online Recommender Systems are becoming popular among system users. Although the influence of the recommender systems is expanding, the possibility of residing fake identities (Sybils) from nefarious users increase due to various reasons. To mitigate the impact of such users, several approaches are proposed. However, the need for robust algorithms is still necessary regarding recommender systems since the small portion of Sybils can distort the accuracy of predictions extremely. We propose a novel robust recommendation algorithm (RobuRec) using information level and admission control. The performance of RobuRec is experimented on various recommendation datasets with all possible Sybil attacks. The evaluation result shows that RobuRec can improve prediction error by 21% and 49% compared to two comparable schemes (LTSMF [23] and PCA [24], respectively). On all datasets and against various attack strategies, in turn, our RobuRec scheme shows the best peformance in terms of prediction shift."
2165425,14040,9896,The new war correspondents: the rise of civic media curation in urban warfare,2013,"In this paper we examine the information sharing practices of people living in cities amid armed conflict. We describe the volume and frequency of microblogging activity on Twitter from four cities afflicted by the Mexican Drug War, showing how citizens use social media to alert one another and to comment on the violence that plagues their communities. We then investigate the emergence of civic media curators, individuals who act as war correspondents by aggregating and disseminating information to large numbers of people on social media. We conclude by outlining the implications of our observations for the design of civic media systems in wartime."
2566831,14040,9896,Exploring collaboration in challenging environments: from the car to the factory and beyond,2012,"We propose a daylong workshop at CSCW2012 on the topic collaboration in challenging and difficult environments, which are to our understanding all contexts, which go beyond traditional working/office settings topic. Examples for these environments can be the automotive context or the context of a semiconductor factory, which show very specific contextual conditions and therefore offer special research challenges: How to address all passengers in the car, not only the driver? How to explore operator tasks in a cleanroom? How could the long-term (social) collaboration of robots and humans be investigated in privacy critical environments?"
2188082,14040,9896,Not my bug! and other reasons for software bug report reassignments,2011,"Bug reporting/fixing is an important social part of the soft-ware development process. The bug-fixing process inher-ently has strong inter-personal dynamics at play, especially in how to find the optimal person to handle a bug report. Bug report reassignments, which are a common part of the bug-fixing process, have rarely been studied.   In this paper, we present a large-scale quantitative and qualitative analysis of the bug reassignment process in the Microsoft Windows Vista operating system project. We quantify social interactions in terms of both useful and harmful reassignments. For instance, we found that reassignments are useful to determine the best person to fix a bug, contrary to the popular opinion that reassignments are always harmful. We categorized five primary reasons for reassignments: finding the root cause, determining ownership, poor bug report quality, hard to determine proper fix, and workload balancing. We then use these findings to make recommendations for the design of more socially-aware bug tracking systems that can overcome some of the inefficiencies we observed in our study."
1859749,14040,9896,A gift from the city: mobile phones in rural China,2012,"In rural Northern China, many people own a mobile phone without ever having purchased it: they received it as a gift from better off relatives, usually their migrant children. Drawing from ethnographic field work in three Chinese villages, we describe practices of mobile phone gifting and the social relations that underlie them, as well as the consequences of the circulation of mobile phones, from the change of use that happens when they move from an urban environment to the countryside, to the possibilities that they open up or close out for rural users. We conclude with implications for technology design that emphasize the situated nature of these experiences and thoughtful approaches to the design of 'traveling' mobiles."
1220940,14040,9099,A multimedia analytics framework for browsing image collections in digital forensics,2012,"Searching through large collections of images to find patterns of use or to find sets of relevant items is difficult, especially when the information to consider is not only the content of the images itself, but also the associated metadata. Multimedia analytics is a new approach to such problems. We consider the case of forensic experts facing image collections of growing size during digital forensic investigations. We answer the forensic challenge by developing specialised novel interactive visualisations which employ content-based image clusters in both the analysis as well as in all visualizations. Their synergy makes the task of manually browsing these collections more effective and efficient. Evaluation of such multimedia analytics is a notoriously hard problem as there are so many factors influencing the result. As a controlled evaluation, we developed a user simulation framework to create image collections with time and directory information as metadata. We apply it in a number of scenarios to illustrate its use. The simulation tool is available to other researchers via our website."
2355033,14040,9896,Productive Interrelationships between Collaborative Groups Ease the Challenges of Dynamic and Multi-Teaming,2012,"Work organization and team membership is highly complex for modern workers. Teams are often dynamic as personnel change during a project. Dynamic team members have to be actively recruited and personnel changes make it harder for participants to retain group focus. Workers are often members of multiple groups. Though prior work has identified the prevalence of multi-teaming and dynamic teams, it has been unable to explain how workers cope with the challenges the new style of work should cause. This paper systematically characterizes the modern organizational landscape from an individual perspective, by studying how people typically organize work across their multiple collaborative groups. A unique contribution of our work is to examine the interrelationships between the collaborative groups individuals typically participate in. We introduce the notion of a collaboration profile to characterize these interrelations. We expected workers to be overburdened by contributing to multiple teams often with shifting personnel. However, we found that multi-teaming involves productive interrelationships between collaborative groups that ease some of the documented challenges of dynamic teams, such as goal setting, recruiting, and group maintenance. We define a typology that describes the various types of collaborative groups workers participate in, and provide examples of productive interrelations between collaborations. In characterizing interrelations between collaborations, we provide detailed examples of how people exploit resources across their different collaborations to address the problems of working in multiple dynamic teams."
2023333,14040,9896,"Tracking changes in collaborative writing: edits, visibility and group maintenance",2012,"Systems for collaborative writing have long captured the attention of CSCW researchers, but have only recently come into widespread use. One issue in designing and understanding these systems is awareness of others' actions in a document. On the one hand, making edits and changes visible can improve collaborators' knowledge of who has made edits and what has changed in a document. On the other hand, studies of large scale editing systems such as Wikipedia have suggested that the visibility of certain edits can incite social conflict in groups. In this interview study, we aim to understand how people perceive and consider the potential impacts of their own and others' edits as they write together. Results suggest that edits embody not just changes to a document, but also social messages that have group maintenance implications. Many participants reported that they carefully consider how to make and explain edits so as to minimize social conflict."
2157213,14040,9896,Understanding employee social media chatter with enterprise social pulse,2014,"The rise of social media in the enterprise has enabled new ways for employees to speak up and communicate openly with colleagues. This rich textual data can potentially be mined to better understand the opinions and sentiment of employees for the benefit of the organization. In this paper, we introduce Enterprise Social Pulse (ESP) -- a tool designed to support analysts whose job involves understanding employee chatter. ESP aggregates and analyzes data from internal and external social media sources while respecting employee privacy. It surfaces the data through a user interface that supports organic results and keyword search, data segmentation and filtering, and several analytics and visualization features. An evaluation of ESP was conducted with 19 Human Resources professionals. Results from a survey and interviews with participants revealed the value and willingness to use ESP, but also surfaced challenges around deploying an employee social media listening solution in an organization."
139456,14040,8884,Evaluating entity summarization using a game-based ground truth,2012,"In recent years, strategies for Linked Data consumption have caught attention in Semantic Web research. For direct consumption by users, Linked Data mashups, interfaces, and visualizations have become a popular research area. Many approaches in this field aim to make Linked Data interaction more user friendly to improve its accessibility for non-technical users. A subtask for Linked Data interfaces is to present entities and their properties in a concise form. In general, these summaries take individual attributes and sometimes user contexts and preferences into account. But the objective evaluation of the quality of such summaries is an expensive task. In this paper we introduce a game-based approach aiming to establish a ground truth for the evaluation of entity summarization. We exemplify the applicability of the approach by evaluating two recent summarization approaches."
1738057,14040,9616,Supervision Strategies for the Online Learning of an Evolving Classifier for Gesture Commands,2014,"Touch sensitive interfaces enable new interaction methods like using gesture commands. To easily memorize more than a dozen of gesture commands, it is important to be able to customize them. The classifier used to recognize drawn symbols must hence be customisable, able to learn from very few data, and evolving, able to learn and improve during its use. This work studies different supervision strategies for the online training of the evolving classifier. We compare six supervision strategies, depending on user interaction (solicitation by the system), and self-evaluation capacities (notion of reject). In particular, there is a trade-off between the number of user interactions, to supervise the online training, and the error rate of the classifier. We show in this paper that the strategy giving the best results is to learn from data validated by the user, when the confidence of the recognition is too low, and from data implicitly validated."
893172,14040,9099,Song Recommendation for Social Singing Community,2014,"Nowadays, an increasing number of singing enthusiasts upload their cover songs and share their performances in online social singing communities. They can also listen and rate other users' song renderings. An important feature of the social singing communities is to recommend appropriate singing-songs which users are able to perform excellently.   In this paper, we propose a singing-song recommendation framework to make song recommendation in social singing community. Instead of recommending songs that people like to listen, we recommend suitable songs that people can sing well. We propose to discover the song difficulty orderings from the song performance ratings of each user. We transform the difficulty orderings into a difficulty graph and propose an iterative inference algorithm to make singing-song recommendation on the difficulty graph. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of our proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first study of singing-song recommendation in social singing communities."
2279472,14040,422,Style in the long tail: discovering unique interests with latent variable models in large scale social E-commerce,2014,"Purchasing decisions in many product categories are heavily influenced by the shopper's aesthetic preferences. It's insufficient to simply match a shopper with popular items from the category in question; a successful shopping experience also identifies products that match those aesthetics. The challenge of capturing shoppers' styles becomes more difficult as the size and diversity of the marketplace increases. At Etsy, an online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods with over 30 million diverse listings, the problem of capturing taste is particularly important -- users come to the site specifically to find items that match their eclectic styles.   In this paper, we describe our methods and experiments for deploying two new style-based recommender systems on the Etsy site. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover trending categories and styles on Etsy, which are then used to describe a user's interest profile. We also explore hashing methods to perform fast nearest neighbor search on a map-reduce framework, in order to efficiently obtain recommendations. These techniques have been implemented successfully at very large scale, substantially improving many key business metrics."
2483389,14040,9896,Beacons of hope in decentralized coordination: learning from on-the-ground medical twitterers during the 2010 Haiti earthquake,2012,"We examine the public, social media communications of 110 emergency medical response teams and organizations in the immediate aftermath of the January 12, 2010 Haiti earthquake. We found the teams through an inductive analysis of Twitter communications acquired over the three-week emergency period from 89,114 Twitterers. We then analyzed the teams' Twitter streams, as well as all digital media they generated and pointed to in their streams - blog posts, photographs, videos, status updates and field reports - to understand the medical coordination challenges they faced from pre-deployment readiness to on-the-ground action. Here we identify opportunities for improving coordination in a decentralized and distributed environment where staffing, disease trajectories, and other circumstances rapidly change. We extrapolate from these findings to theorize about how beaconing behavior is a sign of latent potential for coordination upon which mechanisms of coordination can capitalize."
1561994,14040,422,Using strong triadic closure to characterize ties in social networks,2014,"In the past few years there has been an explosion of social networks in the online world. Users flock these networks, creating profiles and linking themselves to other individuals. Connecting online has a small cost compared to the physical world, leading to a proliferation of connections, many of which carry little value or importance. Understanding the strength and nature of these relationships is paramount to anyone interesting in making use of the online social network data. In this paper, we use the principle of Strong Triadic Closure to characterize the strength of relationships in social networks. The Strong Triadic Closure principle stipulates that it is not possible for two individuals to have a strong relationship with a common friend and not know each other. We consider the problem of labeling the ties of a social network as strong or weak so as to enforce the Strong Triadic Closure property. We formulate the problem as a novel combinatorial optimization problem, and we study it theoretically. Although the problem is NP-hard, we are able to identify cases where there exist efficient algorithms with provable approximation guarantees. We perform experiments on real data, and we show that there is a correlation between the labeling we obtain and empirical metrics of tie strength, and that weak edges act as bridges between different communities in the network. Finally, we study extensions and variations of our problem both theoretically and experimentally."
2147403,14040,9896,Browse and discover: social file sharing in the enterprise,2011,"There is a growth in the popularity of social file sharing systems. This paper describes the design of Cattail, a social file sharing system for the enterprise. Through a 'Recent Events' stream, Cattail supports social navigation and exploratory search by inferring relevant social connections rather than purely relying on user-specified contacts. Social navigation is further supported through pivot browsing from a consolidated history of user actions on an individual's files. Through usage log analysis over an 8-month period, we found that Cattail's novel network inference and social navigation features enabled a net gain of clickthroughs. Interviews with users revealed that this led to increased discovery of relevant people and content. We conclude with a discussion of several possible enhancements to the system. Findings from our research provide a strong foundation for the design of social file sharing systems for enterprise settings."
2486021,14040,9896,Should your MOOC forum use a reputation system,2014,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) rely primarily on discussion forums for interaction among students. We investigate how forum design affects student activity and learning outcomes through a field experiment with 1101 participants on the edX platform. We introduce a reputation system, which gives students points for making useful posts. We show that, as in other settings, use of forums in MOOCs is correlated with better grades and higher retention. Reputation systems additionally produce faster response times and larger numbers of responses per post, as well as differences in how students ask questions. However, reputation systems have no significant impact on grades, retention, or the students' subjective sense of community. This suggests that forums are essential for MOOCs, and reputation systems can improve the forum experience, but other techniques are needed to improve student outcomes and community formation. We also contribute a set of guidelines for running field experiments on MOOCs."
1240166,14040,8806,Automated versioning and temporal navigation for model sketches on large interactive displays,2014,"The development of complex software systems requires the collaboration and mutual understanding of stakeholders from various backgrounds, which is usually facilitated by joint design of complex graphical models. To support this collaboration, we introduce the concept of a so-called Augmented Interaction Room that is equipped with large interactive wall displays, each dedicated to a particular modeling perspective. These models evolve significantly over the project life-cycle as uncertainties are resolved and design decisions are made. Our focus in this paper is to help stakeholders obtain a clearer view of the models' evolution and past design rationales, without incurring significant cognitive effort for navigating a potentially very long and detailed model revision history. For this purpose, we describe mechanisms for storing the history of the continuously evolving models, and methods for temporal navigation that semi-automatically identify particularly relevant past model versions."
1685761,14040,8806,Towards effective group recommendations for microblogging users,2012,"In this paper we propose a group recommendation model that infers the group preferences based on the actions of its members. Such recommendations can be useful when individuals are working together in areas that require relevant up-to-date news information to support decisions. To test our model, we used Twitter, a microblogging service, as a platform to recommend links to news articles. To evaluate our model, we compared the group satisfaction with different strategies of group recommendation. Results show that our model obtained an average group rating of 3.58 out of 5 over the recommendations given to the group. This represents an improvement of approximately 25% over the best performing strategy we tested. We also analyzed the impact of different actions on Twitter and of a time decay parameter on group satisfaction"
2524221,14040,9896,Organizational acculturation and social networking,2011,"For large global enterprises, providing adequate resources for organizational acculturation, the process in which employees learn about an organization's culture, remains a challenge. We present results from a survey of 802 users from an enterprise social networking site that identifies two groups of employees (new to the company and geographically distant from headquarters) that perceive higher benefit from using a SNS to learn about the organization's values and beliefs. In addition, we observe regional differences in viewing behaviors between two groups of new employees. These results suggest that a SNS can also potentially contribute to the information-seeking and sense-making activities that underlie organization acculturation."
2314990,14040,9896,How to see values in social computing: methods for studying values dimensions,2014,"Human values play an important role in shaping the design and use of information technologies. Research on values in social computing is challenged by disagreement about indicators and objects of study as researchers distribute their focus across contexts of technology design, adoption, and use. This paper draws upon a framework that clarifies how to see values in social computing research by describing values dimensions, comprised of sources and attributes of values in sociotechnical systems. This paper uses the framework to compare how diverse research methods employed in social computing surface values and make them visible to researchers. The framework provides a tool to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method for observing values dimensions. By detailing how and where researchers might observe interactions between values and technology design and use, we hope to enable researchers to systematically identify and investigate values in social computing."
783839,14040,8806,Are smartphones better than CRC cards,2014,"During early phases of a software development process co-located group work is an important technique that involves all stakeholders to derive requirements and a design of a future software system. However, such group work is usually applied without any computer-assistance and often faces the problem that information is not well preserved for subsequent steps. In order to examine whether group work benefits from computer-assistance, we developed CREWSpace. It leverages mobile devices to allow simultaneous interaction with a shared software model. In particular, it implements a digital variant of the CRC method. In this paper, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of the traditional CRC method, briefly introduce CREWSpace along with important implementation details, and focus on a qualitative usability study. Its results suggest that our prototype keeps the advantages of traditional CRC method and compensates many of its weaknesses."
66535,14040,8231,Top-N Recommendations by Learning User Preference Dynamics,2013,"In a recommendation system, user preference patterns and the preference dynamic effect are observed in the userxitem rating matrix. However, their value has barely been exploited in previous research. In this paper, we formalize the preference pattern as a sparse matrix and propose a Preference Pattern Subspace to iteratively model the personal and the global preference patterns with an EM-like algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a PrepSVD-I algorithm by transforming the Top-N recommendation as a pairwise preference learning process. Experiment results show that the proposed PrepSVD-I algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Top-N recommendation algorithms."
