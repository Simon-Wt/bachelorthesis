1691234,15237,8228,Design and assessment of a pure hydrodynamic microfluidic switch,2013,"The feasibility of using microfluidic technologies for communication and networking among Labs-On-a-Chip (LoCs), in order to increase reusability, their effectiveness and flexibility, has been already demonstrated in recent works. LoCs are devices, in the size of few centimeters, characterized by μ-scale channels in which small volumes of fluids, either in the form of a continuous stream or of sequences of discrete droplets, move in order to deliver chemical or biological samples to a given destination entity in the microfluidic circuit. They are usually realized through monolithic devices. Samples are processed by passing them through a preset sequence of fixed microfluidic channels. We propose and assess a pure-hydrodynamic switching element in which the path followed by a sample can be controlled through a series of junctions simply modulating the distance between droplets flowing in the microfluidic channel."
1737603,15237,8335,A low-latency asynchronous interconnection network with early arbitration resolution,2014,"A new asynchronous arbitration node is introduced for use as a building block in an asynchronous interconnection network. The target network topology is a variant Mesh-of-Trees (MoT), combining a binary fan-out (i.e. routing) network and a binary fan-in (i.e. arbitration) network, which is becoming widely used for multi-core shared-memory interfaces. The two key features are: (i) each fan-in node can resolve its arbitration and pre-allocate the corresponding input channel, before the actual data arrives; and (ii) a lightweight shadow monitoring network fast forwards information as soon as data enters the network without synchronization to a fixed-rate clock, notifying each fan-in node on its path to enable the early arbitration. Simulations of the new arbitration node, using IBM 90nm technology and an ARM standard cell library, indicate latency reductions up to 54.4% over prior designs, while maintaining roughly comparable throughput. Network-level simulations were then performed on eight diverse synthetic benchmarks, comparing the new approach (early arbitration) with two earlier alternative asynchronous MoT networks (baseline and predictive), using a mix of random and deterministic traffic. Considerable improvements in system latency were obtained on all benchmarks, ranging from 13.0% to 38.7%, with especially strong benefits for the two most adversarial benchmarks."
1492034,15237,8335,HDTV1080p HEVC Intra encoder with source texture based CU/PU mode pre-decision,2014,"HEVC doubles the coding efficiency with more than 4x coding complexity as compared to H.264/AVC. To alleviate the burden of Intra encoder, we estimate the RD-cost from the source image textures, and dynamically select two promising CU/PU mode candidates to execute exhaustive RDO processing. As integrated in our hardwired encoder, the averaged 61.7% computation complexity was saved with 4.53% rate augment. With TSMC 90nm technology, the real-time encoder for HDTV1080p at 44fps is implemented with 2269k-gate at 357MHz operating frequency."
1638713,15237,8335,A volume diagnosis method for identifying systematic faults in lower-yield wafer occurring during mass production,2014,"This work focuses on volume diagnosis for identifying systematic faults in lower-yield wafers, whose yields are lower than baseline level due to systematic faults during mass production. We develop a model-based volume diagnosis method. To diagnose accurately using the fail data with one lower-yield wafer, we apply modeling techniques for handling pseudo-faults and random faults in the fail data. Experimental results show our method's efficiency; we succeeded in identifying the failure layer for 20/22 data sets with actual lower-yield wafers."
2131685,15237,8335,A fast approximation technique for power grid analysis,2011,"In this paper, we present a fast approximation algorithm for computing IR drops in a VLSI power grid. Assuming that the grid does not have pathological defects, the algorithm can estimate IR drops to within 5% average error, with a run time of less than one second per million nodes. Incremental recomputations with new current source values are even faster. The IR drop profiles have excellent correlation with simulated values, making this approach a viable platform for building automatic grid optimization algorithms."
2363464,15237,8335,A unified online directed acyclic graph flow manager for multicore schedulers,2014,"Numerous Directed-Acyclic Graph (DAG) schedulers have been developed to improve the energy efficiency of various multi-core systems. However, the DAG monitoring modules proposed by these schedulers make a priori assumptions about the workload and relationship between the task dependencies. Thus, schedulers are limited to work on a limited subset of DAG models. To address this problem, we propose a unified online DAG monitoring solution independent from the connected scheduler and able to handle all possible DAG models. Our novel low-complexity solution processes online the DAG of the application and provides relevant information about each task that can be used by any scheduler connected to it. Using H.264/AVC video decoding as an illustrative application and multiple configurations of complex synthetic DAGs, we demonstrate that our solution connected to an external simple energy-efficient scheduler is able to achieve significant improvements in energy-efficiency and deadline miss rates compared to existing approaches."
2170731,15237,8335,Fault simulation and test generation for clock delay faults,2011,"In this paper, we investigate the effects of delay faults on clock lines under launch-on-capture test strategy. In this fault model we assume that scan-in and scan-out operations, being relatively slow, can perform correctly even in the presence of a fault. However, a flip-flop may fail to capture a value at correct timing during system clock operation, thus requiring the use of launch-on-capture test strategy to detect such a fault. In the paper, we first show simulation results providing a relation between the duration of the delay and difficulty of detecting such faults in the launch-on-capture test. Next, we propose test generation methods to detect such clock delay faults, and show some experimental results to establish the effectiveness of our methods."
1273914,15237,8335,Performance estimation of embedded software with confidence levels,2012,"Since time constraints are a very critical aspect of an embedded system, performance evaluation can not be postponed to the end of the design flow, but it has to be introduced since its early stages. Estimation techniques based on mathematical models are usually preferred during this phase since they provide quite accurate estimation of the application performance in a fast way. However, the estimation error has to be considered during design space exploration to evaluate if a solution can be accepted (e.g., by discarding solutions whose estimated time is too close to constraint). Evaluate if the possible error can be significant analyzing a punctual estimation is not a trivial task. In this paper we propose a methodology, based on statistical analysis, that provides a prediction interval on the estimation and a confidence level on meeting a time constraint. This information can drive design space exploration reducing the number of solutions to be validated. The results show how the produced intervals effectively capture the estimation error introduced by a linear model."
2504537,15237,8494,Novel MIMO 4-DOF position control for Capsule Endoscope,2011,"In this paper, a novel actuation system for Wireless Capsule Endoscopes (WCE) based on magnetic levitation is proposed. This study focuses on the design of a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO), controller to maintain a desired position and orientation of the capsule relative to the movable electromagnet frame so that it can navigate the intestine by moving this frame and/or the patient. Tracking algorithms for the linear controller based on pole placement, entire eigenstructure assignment (EEA), and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) techniques are designed and simulated using Matlab/Simulink. Simulation results suggest that the LQR controller can be used for capsule actuation."
2230375,15237,8335,Pruning-based trace signal selection algorithm,2011,"To improve the observability in the post-silicon validation, how to select the limited trace signals effectively for the data acquisition is the focus. This paper proposes an automated trace signal selection algorithm, which uses the pruning-based strategy to reduce the exploration space. The experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm can bring higher restoration ratios, and it is more effective compared to existing methods."
1743319,15237,8335,Through-silicon-via-induced obstacle-aware clock tree synthesis for 3D ICs,2012,"In this paper, we present an obstacle-aware clock tree synthesis method for through-silicon-via (TSV)-based 3D ICs. A unique aspect of this problem lies in the fact that various types of TSVs become obstacles during 3D clock routing including signal, power/ground, and clock TSVs. Some of these TSVs become placement obstacles, i.e., they interfere with clock buffers and clock TSVs; while other TSVs become routing obstacles, i.e., clock wires cannot route through them. Thus, the key is to perform TSV-induced obstacle-aware 3D clock routing under the following goals: (1) clock TSVs and clock buffers are located while avoiding overlap with placement obstacles; (2) clock wires are routed while avoiding routing obstacles; and (3) clock skew and slew constraints are satisfied. Related experiments show that our TSV-obstacle-aware clock tree does not sacrifice wirelength or clock power too much while avoiding various TSV-induced obstacles."
2271697,15237,8335,A 58-63.6GHz quadrature PLL frequency synthesizer using dual-injection technique,2011,This paper proposes a 60GHz quadrature PLL frequency synthesizer that has a tuning range capable of covering the whole band specified by the IEEE802.15.3c with exceptional phase noise. The synthesizer is constructed using a 20GHz PLL that is coupled with a frequency tripler to generate the 60GHz signal. Both the 20GHz PLL and the ILO were fabricated using a 65nm CMOS process and measurement results show a phase noise of -96dBc/Hz at 60GHz while consuming 77.5mW from a 1.2V supply.
1865970,15237,8335,Hierarchical exact symbolic analysis of large analog integrated circuits by symbolic stamps,2011,"Linearized small-signal transistor models share the common circuit structure but may take different parameter values in the ac analysis of an analog circuit simulator. This property can be utilized for symbolic circuit analysis. This paper proposes to use a symbolic stamp for all device models in the same circuit for hierarchical symbolic analysis. Two levels of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) are used for maximum data sharing, one for the symbolic device stamp and the other for modified nodal analysis. The symbolic transadmittances of the device stamp share one BDD for storage saving. The modified nodal analysis (MNA) matrix formulated using symbolic stamp is of much lower dimension, hence it can be solved by a determinant decision diagram (DDD) with significantly reduced complexity. A circuit simulator is implemented based on the proposed partitioning architecture. It is able to analyze an op-amp circuit containing 44 MOS transistors  exactly  for the first time."
2253935,15237,8335,Incremental power network analysis using backward random walks,2012,"The process of power network analysis during VLSI chip design is inherently iterative. It is very common for the designer to make many small perturbations to an otherwise complete design, to enhance the design or fix design violations. Considering the size of the modern chips, updating the solution for the changed network can be a computationally intensive task. In this paper we propose an efficient and accurate incremental solver that utilizes the backward random walks to identify the region of influence of the perturbation. The solution of the network is updated for the significantly smaller region only. The proposed algorithm is capable of handling consecutive perturbations without any degradation. The experimental results show speedups of up to 13.7× as compared to a complete solution."

However, it is rarely used for the verification of Designs Under Test containing Real Number Models. This paper presents a new technique using UVM that can be used in order to compare models of analog circuitry on different levels of abstraction. It makes use of statistic metrics.

1467987,15237,8335,Bug localization techniques for effective post-silicon validation,2012,"Post-silicon validation is used to detect and fix bugs in integrated circuits and systems after manufacture. Due to sheer design complexity, it is nearly impossible to detect and fix all bugs before manufacture. Existing post-silicon validation methods barely cope with today's complexity. New techniques are essential to minimize the effects of bugs and design flaws going forward. This talk will focus on two recent techniques, QED and IFRA, that can overcome significant challenges associated with a very crucial step in post-silicon validation: bug localization in a system setup. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques using results from quad-core Intel Core i7 hardware platforms and Intel Nehalem processors, and using actual examples of “difficult” bugs that occurred in complex SoCs."

2143256,15237,8335,Future electron-beam lithography and implications on design and CAD tools,2011,"The steeply increasing price and difficulty of masks make the mask-based optical lithography, such as ArF immersion lithography and extreme ultra-violet lithography (EUVL), unaffordable when going beyond the 32-nm half-pitch (HP) node[1]. Electron beam direct writing (EBDW), so called maskless lithography (ML2), provides an ultimate resolution without jeopardy from masks, but the extremely low productivity of the traditional single beam systems made it very laborious for mass manufacturing after over 3 decades of development. Although electron beam lithography has been long used for mask writing, it is yet very slow and typically takes from hours to days to write a complete 6-inch high-end mask. Direct writing a 300-mm wafer definitely would take much longer. Considering production efficiency in the cleanroom, the throughput of lithography tools should be in the order of 10 wafers per hour (WPH) per square meter as compared to that of an ArF scanner. To achieve such a throughput per e-beam column requires an improvement of more than 3-order. Increasing the beam current in the conventional single beam system would induce the space charge effect and thus is not a solution. Several groups [2][3][4][5] have proposed different multiple electron beam maskless lithography (MEBML2) approaches, by multiplying either Gaussian beams, variable shape beams or by using cell projections, to increase the throughput. The maturing MEMS technology and electronic control technology enable precise control of more than ten thousands or even millions of electron beamlets, writing in parallel. Without the mask constraint, the exposure can be made by continuously scanning across the entire wafer diameter as long as the ultra-high speed data rate can be supported. Hence a much slower scan speed is required and therefore a small tool footprint is achievable.   A MAPPER Pre-Alpha Tool, composed of a 110-beam 5-keV column and a 300-mm wafer stage within a vacuum chamber of 1.3x1.3m 2  footprint, has been installed and operational for process development in the advanced Giga-Fab cleanroom environment. By sending the pre-treated optical data to the correspondent photodiode of each blanker, each beam writes its own features independently in raster scan mode. Resolution beyond 30-nm HP resolution for both C/H and L/S by using chemical amplified resist (CAR) has been demonstrated. Applying proper E-beam proximity corrections (EPC), a 20-nm node test circuit layout has been successfully patterned. The tool will be upgraded with a new Electron-Optics column containing 13,000 beamlets and each beamlet projecting 7x7 sub-beams to achieve 10 WPH of 32-nm HP node wafers by a single chamber.   The achievement of high productivity MEBML2 needs not only the beams, but also the data preparation. For a 10-WPH MEBML2 tool, one wafer exposure is done in 6 minutes. However, the pre-treatments, for example logic operation and EPC, of the huge reticle field data file typically take a few days in present-day mask writing and therefore drastic speed enhancement is required to really gain the benefits of ML2 in cycle time and flexibility. In MAPPER's writing approach, the circuit layout in GDSII or OASIS format at sub-nm addressing grid, whose file size can be up to hundreds of Giga-Bytes after EPC, has to be pre-rasterized to a bitmap writing format of 3.5-nm grid, which file size of the simple 0 and 1 bitmap for a full-26mmx33mm reticle field becomes more than 10 Tera-Bytes(TB). Real-time data decompression in the data path of the tool is designed to avoid storage and transportation of the extremely huge files. In this presentation, several suggestions regarding design, EPC and CAD tools to best fit the nature and operation of MEBML2 in high volume manufacturing are made. Because of high resolution by the e-beam, the restricted design rules due to resolution limit of the optical lithography, especially those related to the double patterning techniques, can be removed. By considering the speed of data treatment, required storage, and computing resources inside the data path, some minor rules like on-pixel design may be recommended. Although contour-based EPC has been demonstrated to meet CD requirements [6][7], hybrid EPC accompanied with dose modulation has been proposed to further enhance the imaging contrast. Even though we will optimize the tool precision to eliminate most of the beam-to-beam CD and overlay errors, it is nevertheless safer to propose some methods to avoid the BtB stitching on critical devices."
1027582,15237,8494,A constructive approach for threshold logic circuit synthesis,2014,"Abstract – In this paper, a novel method to synthesize circuits based on threshold logic gates (TLG) is proposed. Synthesis considering TLGs is quite relevant, since threshold logic has been revisited as a promising alternative to conventional CMOS integrated circuits due to its suitability to emerging technologies, such as tunneling diodes, memristors and spintronics devices. A constructive process is applied to generate optimized TLG networks taking into account multiple goals and design costs, including gate count, logic depth and number of interconnections. Experiments carried out over MCNC benchmark circuits have shown an average gate count reduction of circa 32%, reaching up to 54% in some cases, in comparison to related approaches. Keywords – Digital circuit, logic synthesis, threshold logic, functional composition, threshold networks, TLG. I. I NTRODUCTION The limits of MOS transistor scaling have motivated investigations about new alternative devices, such as spintronics, resonant tunneling devices (RTD), quantum cellular automata (QCA), single electron transistor (SET) and memristors [1]-[3]. In this new scenario, it has been verified that threshold logic gates (TLG) are more suitable to implement digital integrated circuits (ICs) based on these new technologies, differently from the standard AND/OR based CMOS circuit design [4][5]. However, specific CAD tools must be available for developing TLG based ICs. In this sense, one critical task is to obtain efficient network built using TLGs to implement a specific Boolean function. In [5], Zhang et al. proposed a recursive partition of a logic function that is not threshold and merge nodes respecting fan-in restrictions. Unfortunately, the quality of results is very sensitive to the initial Boolean network. On the other hand, the method presented by Subirats et al., in [6], is based on the truth table description of the function. The algorithm compute an ordering of variables using information of on-set and off-set, performing Shannon decomposition up to find threshold logic functions (TLF). However, this approach provides as output a two-level threshold network, without fan-in restriction, being more suitable for neural networks than for IC design. In [7], Gowda et al. used a factorized tree to generate a network of threshold gates. The method recursively breaks the given initial expression tree into sub expressions, identifying sub-tree that are TLFs and assigning the input weights. It is appropriate for IC synthesis using several TLGs, but represents a very time consuming process and presents a strong dependence to the initial expression structure, including the ordering of the initial tree. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to synthesize threshold networks aiming to (1) minimize threshold networks taking into account other costs besides threshold gate count, like logic depth and number of interconnections, (2) generate more than one effective solution, considering a design cost order, and (3) eliminate the structural bias dependence in order to improve the quality of results. It is based on a constructive synthesis [8]-[10], which associates simpler sub-solutions with known costs in order to build more complex networks, allowing the optimization of different cost functions other than just the TLG count. The algorithm uses a novel AND/OR association between threshold networks to reduce the total number of TLGs in the circuit. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, some fundamentals are briefly presented for a better understanding of our approach. Section III describes the algorithm proposed to synthesize threshold logic networks. Section IV provides the experimental results, whereas the conclusions are outlined in Section V. II. P"
1142670,15237,8494,A hybrid analog/digital Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity learning circuit for neuromorphic VLSI multi-neuron architectures,2014,"To endow large scale VLSI networks of spiking neurons with learning abilities it is important to develop compact and low power circuits that implement synaptic plasticity mech- anisms. In this paper we present an analog/digital Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) circuit that changes its internal state in a continuous analog way on short biologically plausible time scales and drives its weight to one of two possible bi-stable states on long time scales. We highlight the differences and improvements over previously proposed circuits and demonstrate the performance of the new circuit using data measured from a chip fabricated using a standard 180nm CMOS process. Finally we discuss the use of stochastic learning methods that can best exploit the properties of this circuit for implementing robust machine-learning algorithms. I. INTRODUCTION In recent years, there has been a proliferation of custom VLSI implementations of computing architectures based on spiking neural networks (1)-(6). These architectures compute in a distributed fashion that is massively parallel and fault tol- erant and they can potentially have very low power consump- tion. Therefore, they are being explored as possible alternative solutions to conventional digital computing approaches. The programming model for these networks, however, is radi- cally different from the conventional von Neumann sequence of instructions model. The knowledge, or the program, in a neural network is encoded in the network architecture, and in the weights of the connections between the neurons. New theories and methods are being developed for understanding how to synthesize pre-specified computing algorithms on these hardware systems through defining appropriate network archi- tectures and connectivity patterns (7), (8). However, to endow these architectures with adaptation and learning mechanisms that change their synaptic weights on-line (e.g., to realize the intended functionality autonomously) it is necessary to develop appropriate compact and low-power plasticity circuits that are compatible with the VLSI architectures being developed. Furthermore, to allow these hardware neuromorphic systems to interact with the user and the environment (e.g., in the field of robotics or neuroprosthetics), it is important that these circuits can exhibit dynamics with biologically plausible time constants. In this paper, we describe a hybrid analog/digital weight- update circuit that can be biased to operate with such time constants. The circuit can be used in a wide variety of spike- based learning protocols and is optimized for minimum size and power-consumption. As the circuit updates its internal state variable when it is stimulated by input digital pulses, it is ideally suited to implement Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning algorithms. The synapse circuit updates its state in an analog way, continuously over time, but it settles to one of two possible states on long-time scales. This enables the design of an extremely compact and low-power circuit that is robust to noise in both the circuit and the input signals. We describe the circuit in the next section. In Section III we demonstrate its properties with experimental results measured from a recent 180 nm CMOS design. In Section IV we present our conclusions and discuss the advantages of binary synapses and show how they can be used for learning uncorrelated pat- terns and for implementing classical neural network learning algorithms.

1817095,15237,8494,Linear programming design of semi-digital FIR filter and ΣΔ modulator for VDSL2 transmitter,2014,"High-speed and high-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are vital components in all telecommunication systems. Radio-frequency digital-to-analog converter (RFDAC) provides high-speed and high-resolution conversion from digital domain to an analog signal. RFDACs can be employed in direct-conversion radio transmitter architectures. The idea of RFDAC is to utilize an oscillatory pulse-amplitude modulation instead of the conventional zero-order hold pulse amplitude modulation, which results in DAC output spectrum to have high energy high-frequency lobe, other than the Nyquist main lobe. The frequency of the oscillatory pulse can be chosen, with respect to the sample frequency, such that the aliasing images of the signal at integer multiples of the sample frequency are landed in the high-energy high-frequency lobes of the DAC frequency response. Therefore the high-frequency images of the signal can be used as the output of the DAC, i.e., no need to the mixing stage for frequency up-conversion after the DAC in the radio transmitter. The mixing stage however is not eliminated but it is rather moved into the DAC elements and therefore the local oscillator (LO) signal with high frequency should be delivered to each individual DAC element.In direct-conversion architecture of IQ modulators which utilize the RFDAC technique, however, there is a problem of finite image rejection. The origin of this problem is the different polarity of the spectral response of the oscillatory pulse-amplitude modulation in I and Q branches. The conditions where this problem can be alleviated in IQ modulator employing RFDACs is also discussed in this work.ΣΔ modulators are used preceding the DAC in the transmitter chain to reduce the digital signal’s number of bits, still maintain the same resolution. By utilizing the ΣΔ modulator now the total number of DAC elements has decreased and therefore the delivery of the high-frequency LO signal to each DAC element is practical. One of the costs of employing ΣΔ modulator, however, is a higher quantization noise power at the output of the DAC. The quantization noise is ideally spectrally shaped to out-of-band frequencies by the ΣΔ modulator. The shaped noise which usually has comparatively high power must be filtered out to fulfill the radio transmission spectral mask requirement.Semi-digital FIR filter can be used in the context of digital-to-analog conversion, cascaded with ΣΔ modulator to filter the out-of-band noise by the modulator. In the same time it converts the signal from digital domain to an analog quantity. In general case, we can have a multi-bit, semi-digital FIR filter where each tap of the filter is realized with a sub-DAC of M bits. The delay elements are also realized with M-bit shift registers. If the output of the modulator is given by a single bit, the semi-digital FIR filter taps are simply controlled by a single switch assuming a current-steering architecture DAC. One of the major advantages is that the static linearity of the DAC is optimum. Since there are only two output levels available in the DAC, the static transfer function, regardless of the mismatch errors, is always given by a straight line.In this work, the design of SDFIR filter is done through an optimization procedure where the ΣΔ noise transfer function is also taken into account. Different constraints are defined for different applications in formulation of the SDFIR optimization problem. For a given radio transmitter application the objective function can be defined as, e.g., the hardware cost for SDFIR implementation while the constraint can be set to fulfill the radio transmitter spectral emission mask."
2201890,15237,20649,"Design, CAD and technology challenges for future processors: 3D perspectives",2011,"Technology scaling has provided the semiconductor industry a recipe to successfully meet the application demands for performance for over three decades. This computational capacity was further fueled by the success of circuit and architecture-level innovation, which provided performance improvement in each processor generation. However, future processor designs face a number of key challenges in sustaining the growth trends. The dawn of the 22nm node, and beyond, marks an era of new trends and challenges; where the cost and complexity associated with each technology node is increasing at much faster rate than the device performance gains. Novel tools and design methodologies are needed to not only compensate for these challenges but also to leverage emerging technologies to achieve the desired performance in future processor architectures. Technology alternatives such as 3D integration have attracted significant interest as an additional way of sustaining the density scaling and performance growth.   3D integration provides some unique benefits for processor design, such as packaging density, interconnect bandwidth and latency, modularity, and heterogeneity. Packaging density improvement provided by 3D can be used to continue improvements in processing and storage capacity as well as enabling a gradual shift towards integrating the full system in one stack. Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) provide lower latency and higher bandwidth that improves interconnect-limited performance. 3D enables modular design of a variety of systems from a shared set of sub-components through functional separation of the device layers. As a result, different layers can be independently manufactured in the most cost effective ways, which can be stacked to compose a wide range of customized systems. Optimizing layer interfaces and infrastructure components, such as power delivery and clocking, can further enhance the inherent modularity advantages. 3D provides opportunities for composing future systems by integrating disparate technologies as well as different technology generations in the same stack. It can be used to incorporate a wide range of device layers including non-volatile memory layers, MEMS, FPGAs, DRAM or photonics in the same stack, easing the IO/off-chip bandwidth limitations. This provides the opportunity to enable processor architectures with new computation, storage and communication capabilities.   The system-level benefits of 3D will be determined, to a significant degree, by the effectiveness of novel design methodologies that explore the new design space introduced by the vertical dimension. Design flow optimization is essential in achieving the highest performance gains as well as tackling the more prominent interdependencies among performance, power dissipation, temperatures, interconnectivity and reliability in 3D. This presentation will highlight these challenges and opportunities."

I NTRODUCTION In electronic medical devices, power consumption is crit-ical, normally to the limited longevity of portable batteries.Due to restriction of limited batteries life, analog-to-digitalconverters (ADCs) become very challenging to design withreasonable performance and considering the bandwidth of themost common bio-potential signals, which ranges from neardc to about 10 kHz, as illustrated in Fig. 1 [1].Sigma-Delta modulators (Ms) have been intensivelyinvestigated for biomedical applications [1]–[3] and also forlow voltage operation [4], [5]. In [2], the authors present astudy of discrete-time (DT) Ms for low power applications,where one of the modulators uses a DT passive loop-ﬁlterand achieves a reasonable performance with a very low powerconsumption. Nevertheless, the approach use large capacitorsto implement the DT loop-ﬁlter and consequently leads to alarge area. A low voltage and low power active DT M forbiomedical sensors is discussed in [3]. The design approachrelies on the bulk-driven technique at the input differentialpair of the transconductance ampliﬁer to enable a wider inputrange. However, the performance in terms of SNDR anddynamic range (DR) is poor. Targeting a very low voltageoperation, a DT M is discussed in [4]. For that, the am-pliﬁers are implemented using near-threshold-voltage biasedinverters with a good overall performance. Despite of the lowervoltage operation, the circuit consumes a considerable current.Several other solutions that use Ms, to improve the powerdissipation are discussed in [6], but they are implemented for"
1309592,15237,8500,"F6: High-speed transceivers: Standards, challenges, and future",2011,"Multi-Gbps transceivers have evolved from what were once exotic special-purpose cells to ubiquitous building blocks that are expected to function as the glue bet ween critical compute, communications, and storage elements. As such they are expected to function flawlessly, interoperate cleanly, and consume little power, area, and system design mindshare. As part of the 'commoditizing' of transceivers, the pressure to achieve multiple standards compliance from individual designs has increased dramatically no longer are ASIC or system designers content with a single PHY for a single standard. The consequential impact on the design space means link designers must often 'right size' a swiss-army-knife design including power and area optimization; you don't want too many or too few 'blades'. Sometimes conflicting standards requirements can make customization and optimization a real challenge in this space. Jared Zerbe of Rambus will review some of the fundamental transceiver challenges and techniques used to address them, including a discussion of the impact of multi-standard compliance on the transceiver design effort and ultimate performance. Following this, Thomas Toifl of IBM will discuss the design challenges and solutions to data rates above 20Gb/s. Main challenges are achieving the required bandwidth with full ESD protection, the DFE loop timing, and overall design complexity. Marcus van lerssel of Snowbush IP will discuss implementation challenges and the benefits of a multi-standard PHY supporting Ethernet/PCIe/SATA/USB. Takeshi Horiefrom Fujitsu will present Ethernet standards and the technologies required to realize 10GB serial backplane transfer for 10GB Ethernet. When it comes to buidling standards compliant PHYs, IP providers face challenges that arise from the need to proliferate the design across many process geome tries/foundries and also from the large variability in customer's expertise in package design and signal integrity analysis. Dan Weinlader of Synopsys will discuss how standards influence these challenges. The main focus of standards over the last few years has understandably been on addressing the bandwidth curve. The need to address the rising power struggle of SoCs is usually recognized, but limited to simple power targets. The final two presentations in this forum will focus on energy efficiency by Fulvio Spagna of Intel and on low-power solutions by Anthony Sanders of Lantiq."

This tutorial looks at clock constraints in timing analysis as the affect the hierarchical design flow and timing validation across process variation. The focus is upon how constraints support construction, from a practical perspective forged over many years working on clock tree implementation. This tutorial would cover the following important topics in clock implementation: • Timing with propagated clocks and ideal clocks: background on timing report structure and setup/hold particularly on IO paths, assumption of synchronous design • Virtual clocks for IO timing: role to keep path constraints unchanged, standard calculation methods for its latency, problems with values in standard blockmodels, timing impact in using Max rather than average latency. • Refocus on role of virtual-clock latency in hierarchical design; description of improved approach • Propagation on pins rather than clock objects to avoid updating constraints after synthesis. Note exception where virtual clock required. • Description of the role of float pins in clock tree synthesis • Using latency values to: a) anticipate clock-gate-enable timing and b) enable single ETMs for macros. • Why memories need a float pin and an early latency • Types of variation contrasting global vs local: discussion of transistor and parasitic corners. • Demonstration of extent of variation by taking a simple repeater chain and varying the segment drivers; consequence to clock design ⇒ need to balance not just delay but also sources of delay, including within macro design. • Difference between Setup and Hold closure and how these motivate corners for design sign-off; hold is variation about the mean - setup is from the edge of the curve. • Setup is slowest corner: temperature effect (slows interconnect, hastens transistors except when it does not!) - also check FAST wafers if voltage lowered for power saving. • Hold is NOT a feature of fast data-paths but rather is dominated by clock skew which is an outcome of variation ⇒ worst corners are corners away from where clock optimized; explanation of hold risk from scan reordering and how it is minimized • Role of derates (OCV and AOCV) and clock uncertainty; increase of hold uncertainty is catastrophic. • Wire design: Signal EM avoidance ⇒ wider metal; Cross-talk avoidance (effect of cross-talk on timing in general - on macros in particular) ⇒ spacing vs shielding: latency, resource use, power (target skew); Early description to enable tool anticipation of final parasitics and resource allocation"
724798,15237,9772,T2B: Carbon nanotubes and opportunities for wireless on-chip interconnect,2014,"With the growing sophistication of systems-on-chip and networks-on-chip (NoCs), communication among the various parts of such systems is becoming increasingly difficult and interconnect is presenting one of the main bottlenecks to further scaling and increased integration densities. Indeed, materials innovation and improvements to traditional interconnect schemes may not be sufficient for continuing the scaling trend for much longer, and new paradigms might be required. One such paradigm is that of wireless NoCs, where at least a portion of the interconnect lines are replaced by wireless links. However, to implement this scheme using even the highest available electronic frequencies requires antenna devices with dimensions at least on the millimeter scale, meaning that unacceptably large areas of the chip would be taken by these devices and limiting the number of such wireless links. Going to substantially higher frequencies, that is optical frequencies, where the corresponding wavelengths are in the micro/nano scale and the antennas would thus be much smaller, may represent a viable approach to tackle this challenge. The optical properties of carbon nanotubes and, indeed, other nanoscale wires, represent an interesting and rich regime of operation. On one hand, given their electronic band structure and typical band gap values, the interband transitions in these devices, like in many other solid-state device, could lead to the generation or absorption of visible or infrared light. On the other hand, these nanoscale wires can be made to lengths on the order of several hundreds of nanometers or micrometers, comparable to the wavelength of the radiation being emitted or absorbed. Therefore, their geometry could play a significant role in the distribution of the electromagnetic wave and how the emitted or absorbed light interacts with them, similar to the situation in radio or microwave antennas (albeit at much shorter wavelengths). In other words, both the quantum nature of light and its wave nature are manifest at the same time, combining the worlds of light-emitting diodes and photodetectors with that of electromagnetic antennas. This leads to a rich set of effects and possibilities. In this tutorial, we will review the optical absorption and emission properties of carbon nanotubes and describe how these properties could potentially enable us to establish a wireless network at the small scale for interconnect applications. Devices could be implemented where the signal generation/detection and antenna functionalities are combined. Other devices may only benefit from a subset of these functionalities enabled by nanotubes. We will also discuss some of the performance benefits that may be achieved through such an approach."
1170010,15237,9772,CloudLEGO: scalable cross-VM-type application performance prediction,2013,"Understanding the performance difference of a multi-tier Cloud application between different provisioning plans and workloads is difficult to achieve. A typical IaaS provider offers a variety of virtual server instances with different performance capacities and rental rates. Such instances are often marked with a high level description of their hardware/software configuration (e.g. 1 or 2 vC-PUs) which provides insufficient information on the performance of the virtual server instances. Furthermore, as each tier of an application can be independently provisioned with different types and numbers of VMs, the number of possible provisioning plans grows exponentially with each additional tier.   Previous work [10] proposed to perform automatic experiments to evaluate candidate provisioning plans, which leads to high cost due to the exponential increase of candidate provisioning plans with the number of tiers and available VM types. While several existing works [8, 6, 7] studied a variety of performance models for multi-tier applications, these works assume that an application runs on a fixed deployment (with fixed machine type and number for each tier).   We present CloudLEGO, an efficient cross-VM-type performance learning and prediction approach. Since building a model for each possible deployment is clearly not scalable, instead of treating each candidate deployment separately, CloudLEGO views them as derivatives from a single, fixed deployment. Accordingly, the task of learning the performance of a targeted deployment can be decoupled into learning the performance of the original fixed deployment and learning the performance  difference  between the original deployment and the targeted one.   The key to efficiently capture performance difference between deployments is to find multiple independent changes that can be used to derive any deployment from the original deployment. CloudLEGO formulates such modular changes as VM type changes at a given tier. To capture changes of performance at a tier caused by VM type changes, CloudLEGO uses relative performance models [5] which predict the performance  difference  between a pair of VMs (rather than the absolute performance of a VM) for a given workload. Moreover, training relative performance models requires only performance data from Cloud monitoring services [1, 4] rather than fine-grain data such as per-tier response time which requires application instrumentation.   Training relative performance models with traditional passive learning techniques would require a large amount of training data as performance data are collected uniformly in a single batch. We find that different types of VMs often share similar performance for many regions of workloads. To leverage this characteristic and guide the profiling to regions with high performance differences, CloudLEGO uses active learning techniques [2, 3, 9] that split the profiling process into multiple stages where data collected in one stage are used to identify high-value regions for the next profiling stage. As a result, it significantly speeds up the convergence of models and the profiling process due to substantially reduced measurement.   We deploy CloudLEGO in IBM's Research Computing Cloud (RC2), an Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud, to evaluate its effectiveness. Our results suggest that CloudLEGO provides accurate predictions for various deployments and workloads with only a fraction of training cost incurred by existing techniques."
1568359,15237,23593,Harnessing the power of FPGAs using altera's OpenCL compiler,2013,"In recent years, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays have become extremely powerful computational platforms that can efficiently solve many complex problems. The most modern FPGAs comprise effectively millions of programmable elements, signal processing elements and high-speed interfaces, all of which are necessary to deliver a complete solution. The power of FPGAs is unlocked via low-level programming languages such as VHDL and Verilog, which allow designers to explicitly specify the behavior of each programmable element. While these languages provide a means to create highly efficient logic circuits, they are akin to assembly language programming for modern processors. This is a serious limiting factor for both productivity and the adoption of FPGAs on a wider scale. In this talk, we use the OpenCL language to explore techniques that allow us to program FPGAs at a level of abstraction closer to traditional software-centric approaches. OpenCL is an industry standard parallel language based on 'C' that offers numerous advantages that enable designers to take full advantage of the capabilities offered by FPGAs, while providing a high-level design entry language that is familiar to a wide range of programmers.   To demonstrate the advantages a high-level programming language can offer, we demonstrate how to use Altera's OpenCL Compiler on a set of case studies. The first application is single-precision general-element matrix multiplication (SGEMM). It is an example of a highly-parallel algorithm for which an efficient circuit structures are well known. We show how this application can be implemented in OpenCL and how the high-level description can be optimized to generate the most efficient circuit in hardware. The second application is a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is a classical FPGA benchmark that is known to have a good implementation on FPGAs. We show how we can implement the FFT algorithm, while exploring the many different possible architectural choices that lead to an optimized implementation for a given FPGA. Finally, we discuss a Monte-Carlo Black-Scholes simulation, which demonstrates the computational power of FPGAs. We describe how a random number generator in conjunction with computationally intensive operations can be harnessed on an FPGA to generate a high-speed benchmark, which also consumes far less power than the same benchmark running on a comparable GPU. We conclude the tutorial with a set of live demonstrations.   Through this tutorial we show the benefits high-level languages offer for system-level design and productivity. In particular, Altera's OpenCL compiler is shown to enable high-performance application design that fully utilizes capabilities of modern FPGAs."
2387645,15237,8500,An SRAM using output prediction to reduce BL-switching activity and statistically-gated SA for up to 1.9× reduction in energy/access,2013,"Mobile applications such as tablets pack increasingly more processing capability comparable to workstations or laptops but can do little for cooling or extending the battery life in their form factors. SRAMs account for a large fraction of chip area and are critical in this context. Recent work has focused on voltage scaling in SRAMs, which is an effective way of achieving energy efficiency [1,2]. These conventional SRAMs are mostly general-purpose in the sense that they are designed without considering the specific features of the data they will store. However, application-specific features such as statistics of storage data can be exploited and incorporated into the transistor-level design to provide a new dimension towards achieving the next level of energy savings in addition to the savings provided through voltage scaling. The work in [3] is an example where an inversion bit is added for each word to reduce read-bitline (RBL) transitions in an 8T-cell-based design with a single-ended read port. Similarly, the work in [4] stores only the LSBs of each word in 6T SRAMs where occasional bit-errors at low voltages are tolerable for its application. In this work, we focus on video; however, the ideas can be generalized to different applications. In video encoders, pixel processing is performed over large partitions of image frames (e.g., 192×192 pixels), which are stored in on-chip SRAMs and accessed frequently. Image frames generally consist of smooth backgrounds or large objects where the intensity of pixels is spatially correlated. For the video image frame in Fig. 18.2.1, the deviation of each pixel's intensity from its block average for a 16×16 block shows that 76% of pixels lie within 3 LSB of the average. This additional information can be used to design an SRAM where correlation of data is used to reduce bitline activity factor which, for an 8T SRAM in a 65nm low-power CMOS process, accounts for ~50% of total energy consumption during read accesses at 0.6V. In this work, we present a prediction-based reduced-bitline-switching-activity (PB-RBSA) scheme along with a hierarchical sensing network with statistical sense-amplifier gating to exploit the correlation of storage data. Reduction of switching activity on the bitlines and in the sensing network of the memory provide up to 1.9× reduction in energy/access."
1918136,15237,20649,3D heterogeneous system integration: application driver for 3D technology development,2011,"Three dimensional integration complements semiconductor scaling; it enables a higher integration density as well as heterogeneous technology integration. Using 3D chip stacking, it is possible to extend the number of functions per 3D chip well beyond the near-term capabilities of traditional scaling. The 3D strata may be realized using advanced CMOS technology nodes but may also exploit a wide variety of device technologies to optimize system performance.   3D of electronic circuits has become a field of great interest in the microelectronics community. A wide variety of approaches are being proposed for an equally wide variety of applications. These approaches can be categorized based on their intersection with the interconnect hierarchy on chip and in the package: from local-to-global interconnect, to bond-pad-level, package and board level. This paper will focus on 3D interconnects using through-Si-vias that allow interconnectivity at the on-chip global interconnect level. The physical dimensions of these TSVs are 5μm diameter and are 50μm deep and can be placed at a minimum pitch of 10μm.   The study and development of 3D System integration requires a concurrent exploration of technology and design. This is particularly the case when considering heterogeneous systems, exploiting different technologies that cannot be integrated in a single IC process. 3D-technology with high density TSV's allow for the seamless integration of circuit blocks (IP blocks) of different technologies in the same manner as a traditional SOC architecture, resulting in a 3D-SOC implementation: concurrently designed IC's in heterogeneous technologies.   The 3D integration approach should be cost-effective and consider the potential compound yield risks by adopting the appropriate testing and known-good-die strategies. A path finding design flow for 3D has been implemented that enables the study the system-level trade-offs at an early phase of the system design. In this path finding design flow, the physical characteristics of a 3D stacked circuit implementation are accounted for. This includes detailed electrical models for the TSV and μbump interconnections, compact mechanical models that account for the impact of mechanical stresses inducted buy the TSV on neighboring components, mechanical stresses imposed by the package and compact thermal models that allow for a fast estimation of chip temperatures across the die within a 3D-stack."

2236727,15237,20649,Lithography at 14nm and beyond: choices and challenges,2011,"As the gap between the lithography wavelength and critical feature size has continued to increase, the semiconductor industry has had to adjust. Previously, scaling along Moore's Law had relied on improvement in lithography equipment, occasionally by reducing the wavelength and frequently by improving the effective numerical aperture. The wavelength used to define critical dimensions during much of the nineties was 248nm, with the industry switching to 193nm in the following decade. After 157nm technology failed to materialize due to technological challenges, the focus of next generation lithography (NGL) research shifted to EUV. Meanwhile, 193nm continued to be the workhorse for the continuation of Moore's Law. The next big equipment advancement came with immersion steppers, which increased the effective aperture of the lens, thereby capturing more of the diffraction orders in the imaging process. Moore's Law, however requires a significant innovation every two years! With optical lithography wavelength and effective lens aperture stretched to these limits, double patterning came to the rescue. By splitting the pattern into two, the burden on each mask was somewhat reduced, allowing a stitched pattern to scale. All through these changes, continued scaling also required a tighter co-optimization between process and design. As the image quality became generally weaker, greater restrictions were placed on the diversity of features that could be robustly patterned, leading to the proverbial increase in the heft of design rule manuals.   All through these heroic efforts to continue Moore's Law, in order to reap the resulting benefits to the electronics industry, a relatively new field called Computational Lithography has been providing a helping hand. Computational Lithography comprises a broad set of techniques that use physics-based calculations to eke out greater lithographic performance from a given generation of steppers. This fertile field has recently introduced two advanced features: inverse lithography, and source-mask optimization. Such techniques have helped extend the life of optical lithography beyond previously forecast durations. At the same time, as other lithography technologies become more mature, much of the computational infrastructure developed to extend optical lithography will likely be used to optimize the newer technologies. This paper will provide some examples of how Computational Lithography is creating novel and affordable solutions to sustain the scaling trend."

It is important to gather scientific data in an area which have potential of wind farm development. An IR camera recording and its analysis can provide necessary information to wildlife biologists involve with interaction of birds/bats with wind turbines. An efficient IR video processing algorithm has been developed. The proposed algorithm consists of background and consecutive frame subtraction, frame selection, 3-D region labeling and breakpoint recovery. It is then used to process spring 2011 bird migration data that has been collected in Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge in Ohio. Results from this study will be useful for wildlife biologists to make intelligent decision for siting of wind turbines. It will also help policy makers to develop an appropriate public policy for wind farm development in an area with extensive avian activity. Moving object tracking has received considerable attention because of the wide range of its potential applications. Analysis of recorded videos can help in capturing the movement and classify objects. This project aims to assist wildlife biologists in the observation of birds'/bats' behaviors in the vicinity of wind turbines. A multi-sensor approach using radar, IR video imaging, and acoustic recording of bird and bat calls is being developed(1)(2)(3). The system will be used to track the birds'/bats' flying trajectories and analyze their behaviors, such as direction, velocity, travel distance, and straightness in the vicinity of wind turbines. This paper focuses on IR video data processing of recorded birds'/bats' activities during nocturnal migration. A IR video processing algorithm has been developed for this application. The goal of this work is to show trajectories of flying birds'/bats', compute passage rates, total numbers, direction of flight, object size, heat, velocity, and straightness index. This information will then help and guide the mitigation process which may reduce unwanted effects on birds/bats. The IR video data in this project is recorded by FLIR SR- 19 camera.

The FLIR SR-19 thermal camera was deployed along with marine radar and acoustic recorders for both birds and bats at Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge in the western basin of Lake Erie, Ohio during 2011 spring bird migration period. This area has been sighted for development of potential on-shore and off-shore wind farms due to availability of high winds. The data was collected from three different sources (IR camera, marine radar and acoustic recorders) continuously starting in one hour after the sunset to one hour before the sunrise. In this case, there are 63000 frames in 1 GB data. Since the total size of data for one season is approximately 205 GB, there are 12,915,000 frames that need to be processed.

1528338,15237,23593,Should the academic community launch an open-source FPGA device and tools effort?: evening panel,2011,"For years, many academic researchers in reconfigurable computing have been frustrated by their reliance on commercial FPGAs and tools. Commercial FPGAs have highly complex micro-architectures, come with undocumented binary interfaces, have no compatibility between generations, and come with difficult to use proprietary place and route tools. The FPGA vendors are making the right moves for serving their commercial customer base, but it seems at times these moves are in conflict with the needs of the academic research community.   These problems make it difficult for academics to teach FPGA design and to participate in relevant research related to FPGAs. Complex FPGA fabrics and undocumented proprietary interfaces make it nearly impossible to build new tools to target actual commercial devices. University researchers are now hesitant to participate in FPGA architecture research because the level of complexity of FPGAs is beyond what is possible to implement in an academic setting. Reconfigurable computing application developers are at the mercy of complex FPGA devices and closed-source place and route tools - not optimized for computing applications.   Some argue that the time is right for academia to break away and create an open source FPGA device. Such an effort would enable university researchers to take an active role in architecture design, and promote an open source community effort in developing and advancing the state of the art of tools.   A similar situation existed in the early 80's surrounding processor design. As a result of competition among the big computer companies, microprocessor designs had evolved from very simple beginnings to highly complex architectures and equally complex compilers. Universities were largely on the sidelines, as they couldn't compete at the level of industrial designs of the day. RISC changed all that. By adopting simple architectures, universities were once again able to actually design and implement their own processors and to innovate with microarchitecture and compilers.   Is it time for a RISC revolution for FPGAs? FPGA companies might argue that FPGA platforms are necessarily complex and out of the realm of what's possible to implement within an academic setting, and would say that an open source effort in not necessary, as they are helping to promote academic research by collaborations with universities, and donation of tools, and hardware platforms.   This panel will discuss the pros and cons of an academic community led open FPGA device and tools development effort."
746954,15237,23907,A Supply-Scalable Differential Amplifier With Pulse-Controlled Common-Mode Feedback,2014,"This paper proposes a pulse-controlled common- mode feedback circuit for a supply-scalable fully-differential amplifier. The pulse-controlled common-mode feedback circuit overcomes the large area cost associated with a conventional R- C common-mode feedback circuit while maintaining high gain and large output signal range of the amplifier. The amplifier is implemented in low power/leakage 65nm CMOS technology with NMOS and PMOS threshold voltages of 0.36V and -0.44V and operates at a supply voltage from 0.6V to 1.2V. The prototype has an active area of 0.01mm 2 and consumes 1.21mW at 0.6V, 1.94mW at 0.9V and 3.07mW at 1.2V. The measured output noise spectrum density is 21.5nV/ p Hz at 0.6V, 26.1nV/ p Hz at 0.9V and 30.3nV/ p Hz at 1.2V. For a total harmonic distortion of 1%, the maximum signal of the amplifier with frequency 10MHz is measured as -2.3dBm at 0.6V, 3.8dBm at 0.9V and 6.1dBm at 1.2V; as expected, the linearity of the amplifier depends on its signal headroom which scales with the supply voltage. I. INTRODUCTION Supply-scalable circuits are receiving more attention in recent years (1) (2) because they are suitable for energy- harvesting systems with unstable supplies, but without extra power management. However, they meet more design chal- lenges than low voltage circuits in low power/leakage CMOS technology with transistors with large threshold voltage, espe- cially for fully-differential amplifiers. The large threshold volt- age leads to small margins on operating points of the amplifier making its bandwidth and gain easily become insufficient under a supply change. Body-input or body-bias circuits (3) can be applied to lower the threshold voltage by biasing the body- source junction for low voltage operation, but they have limited uses at a high supply. The on-resistance of analog switches associated with the threshold voltage has much variation to supplies which limits signal swing and bandwidth (4). Switch bootstrapping circuits (5) are widely used for reducing the on- resistance of switches in low voltage circuits, but they may suffer from reliability problems for flexible supply operation. At a low supply, the gate-to-source voltage of the transistors for switches is fixed by the supply voltage to minimize switch non-idealities, but it may make the gate voltage exceed the breakdown voltage of the transistors while the supply voltage becomes high. In addition to the challenges associated with differential signal path, the common-mode feedback circuit is another bottleneck for flexible supply operation. Three commonly used common-mode feedback circuits are: a passive R-C common- mode feedback circuit (6), an active differential-pair common- mode feedback circuit (7) and a switched-capacitor common- mode feedback circuit (8). The R-C common-mode feedback circuit can operate at different supplies, but requires large resistance to maintain the high DC gain and large output swing. Differential-pair common-mode feedback circuit does not need large area passive components, but it has limited linear signal range for the main amplifier and is not suitable at a low supply. The switched-capacitor common-mode feedback circuit also has smaller passive area, but its loop bandwidth and stability is very sensitive to the supply voltage because of the supply-dependent on-resistance of the switches. In addition, a big unsettled summing error leading to a wrong common- mode voltage for large differential signals can be caused by the large and nonlinear on-resistance switch resistance; at a low supply, these switches can not fully turn due to the large threshold voltage in low power/leakage processes. A novel pulse-controlled common-mode feedback circuit (PC CMFB) is proposed to significantly reduce the area of passive components and overcome the limitations of switch on-resistance for supply scaling. A supply-scalable fully-differential amplifier with the PC CMFB was implemented in a low power/leakage CMOS pro- cess. Compared with conventional common-mode feedback circuits, the proposed PC CMFB has smaller passive area without gain reduction of the main amplifier. The paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the operation of the pulse-controlled common-mode feedback circuit. Section III describes the circuits of the supply-scalable fully-differential amplifier with the PC CMFB and section IV presents the measurement results."
1535863,15237,8500,A 33.6-to-46.2GHz 32nm CMOS VCO with 177.5dBc/Hz minimum noise FOM using inductor splitting for tuning extension,2013,"Signal processing in ultra-wide bandwidths is one of the key challenges in the design of multi-Gb/s wireless transceivers at mm-Waves, where channels covering 57GHz to 66GHz are specified. Further considering spreads due to process variations and the stringent reference phase noise to ensure signal integrity calls for an ultra-wide tuning range and low-noise on-chip oscillator. Meeting this target is even more challenging when adopting an ultra-scaled CMOS technology node where key passive components suffer from a reduced quality factor (Q) [1]. In a 32nm node the thickness of metals closer to the substrate is half that in a 65nm process leading, for example, to MOM capacitors with roughly half Q. The penalty is only marginally compensated by the higher transistor f t , improved only by ~20%. Various techniques exploiting alternative tuning implementations have been published recently. Magnetic tuning methods where the equivalent tank inductance is varied through reflection of the secondary coil impedance of a transformer demonstrate outstanding tuning ranges but at the cost of a severe trade-off with tank Q and poor noise FOMs [2,3]. A bank of capacitors switched in and out in an LC tank is the most popular tuning approach [4-6]. However the quality factor is severely degraded, when large ranges are involved. In this work, the switched-capacitor tank of the VCO shown in Fig. 20.3.1 is centered around two different resonance frequencies by splitting the inductor through the switch M sw . In particular, an up-shift is produced when the switch is off due to its parasitic capacitance. The frequency range is significantly increased without compromising tank Q leading to large tuning range and high FOM simultaneously. Prototypes of the VCO have been realized in 32nm CMOS showing the following performances: 31.6% frequency tuning range, minimum phase noise of -118dBc/Hz at 10MHz offset from 40GHz with 9.8mW power dissipation. Despite being realized in an ultra-scaled 32nm standard digital CMOS process without RF thick metal options, the oscillator shows state-of-the-art performances."
1709204,15237,8494,Register allocation for hybrid register architecture in nonvolatile processors,2014,"Abstract —Nonvolatile processors (NVP) have been an emerging topicin recent years due to its zero standby power, data retention andinstant-on features. The conventional full replacement architecture inNVP has drawbacks of large area overhead and high backup energy.This paper provides a partial replacement based hybrid register ar-chitecture to signiﬁcantly abate above problems. However, the hybridregister architecture can induce potential critical data loss and backuperrors. In this paper, we propose a critical-data overﬂow aware registerallocation (CORA). Different from other register allocation methods,CORA efﬁciently reduces the possibility of critical data spilling andbackup errors. The experiment results show that CORA reduces thecritical data overﬂow rate by up to 52%. The hybrid register architecturereduces the chip area by 45 . 1% and backup energy by 82 . 8% when usingCORA. I. I NTRODUCTION Nonvolatile processor (NVP) is one of the most promising tech-niques to realize energy efﬁcient computing systems. Some previousworks use different nonvolatile memories to implement NVP [1]–[3]and they declares the following advantages in NVP: (i) zero-standbypower, (ii) nanosecond sleep/wakeup speed [2], (iii) high resilienceto power failures, (iv) micro-second-grained power managementsupported [3].Previous works always use a full replacement architecture in NVP,which means that all the registers are replaced by the nonvolatileﬂip-ﬂops (NVFF). However, people tend to use large register ﬁlesin ultra low power processors [4] and GPUs [5] (e.g. the area ofregisters can exceed 40% of the total chip area [4]). In this case,the full replacement architecture induces nontrivial problems. First,it increases the chip area by up to 90% [6], due to the large areaof NVFF. Second, it consumes relatively high backup energy, whichincreases the risk of backup failure when power supply is weak.This paper proposes a hybrid register architecture (shown inFig. 1(c)) to tackle the problems of the full replacement architecture.It partially replaces the registers to reduce the number of NVFFs,hence the area and backup energy. The rationality of this architectureis that the critical data, which represent the system states, are alwaysstored in a small portion of ﬂip-ﬂops. However, this architecture hasthe risk of unexpected critical data loss, i.e., some critical data arenot assigned to the NVFFs when the backup proceeds. In orderto prevent this situation, we introduce a novel register allocationalgorithm to minimize the opportunity of critical data overﬂow. Itis called critical-data overﬂow aware register allocation (CORA).CORA aims to minimize the possibility of critical data overﬂow in thehybrid register architecture, compared with other register allocationalgorithms which aim to minimize the memory access [7], [8].The contributions of this paper are listed as the following:"

A wide SIMD vector permutation engine is required to achieve high-throughput data rearrangement operations on large data sets, with scaled supply voltages to deliver high energy efficiency. An ultra-low-voltage reconfigurable 4-way to 32-way SIMD vector permutation engine consisting of a 32-entry × 256b 3-read/1-write ported register file with a 256b byte-wise any-to-any permute crossbar for 2-dimensional shuffle is fabricated in 22nm CMOS.

1611018,15237,8494,Spin-transfer torque magnetic memory as a stochastic memristive synapse,2014,"Abstract — Spin-transfer torque magnetic memory (STT-MRAM) is currently under intense academic and industrial development, since it features nonvolatility, high write and read speed and high endurance. In this work, we show that when used in an original regime, it can additionally act as a stochastic memristive device, appropriate to implement a “synaptic” function. We introduce basic concepts relating to STT-MRAM cell behavior and its possible use to implement learning-capable synapses. System-level simulations on a problem of car counting highlight the potential of the technology for learning systems. Monte Carlo simulations show its robustness to device variations. These results open the way for unexplored applications of STT-MRAM in robust, low power, cognitive-type systems. Keywords: STT-MRAM, neuromorphic, memristor, stochastic computation. I. I NTRODUCTION Thanks to considerable progress in recent years, spin-transfer torque magnetic memory (STT-MRAM) – the second generation of magnetic memory – now appears as a breakthrough for embedded and standalone non-volatile memory, providing fast programming and high endurance [1]. However, a limitation of this technology is its stochastic switching nature [1]–[3]. The time required for programming from a memory state to another is a random quantity, which requires designing programming times magneticwith high security margins, to ensure reliable programming. Device physicists have intensely studied this effect of intrinsic probability [4], [5], and circuit designers have proposed ideas like self-enabled programming to mitigate the issue [2]. However, an alternative approach is to not consider this randomness as a drawback, but as a feature of the device. In particular, here we reinterpret STT-MRAM cell’s behavior as a “stochastic memristive device”. And we show by system-level simulations how it may be used in a neuromorphic system for real life applications. In recent years, the exploitation of nanodevices with memory effects (or memristive devices) as synapses in neuromorphic systems has stimulated a growing interest [6]–[17]. They raise the hope for a breakthrough in electronics, bringing smarter, lower power and more adaptive systems. Most of these proposals use memory devices with multi-level capability – the original memristor paradigm [8]. However, an alternative idea is to use binary devices programmed in a"

The Ivy Bridge architecture is derived from the second-generation Intel Core™ processor [2], seen in Fig. 3.1.1. The processor has about 1.4 billion transistors in about 160mm 2  in its largest incarnation. It introduces several enhancements in power, performance, and features over its predecessor. The IA core adds a pipelined divider, a next page prefetcher, additions to the ISA for 16b floating point conversion, fast string moves, and fast access of the FS/GS base registers. The Graphics/Media block provides significantly improved performance along with DX11 API support. Further, display capabilities have been augmented with a third independent display pipeline. The on-die power management control unit (PCU) and its associated firmware have added several power and thermal optimizations to improve performance and yield within the existing platform power envelopes, as well as to improve idle power relative to its predecessor. Power gates are distributed throughout the cores, enabling the PCU to independently either reduce voltage to a state retention voltage, or turn off voltage to a given core, depending on the current core usage conditions. The processor also implements power gating for portions of the DDR I/O buffers, reducing CPU power consumption when memory is in “self-refresh” mode. To optimize core sleep time, Ivy Bridge incorporates smart interrupt routing logic, which sends interrupts to active cores. The PCU also analyzes the processor's inherent voltage-frequency dependency to determine the optimum operating voltages across the entire dynamic range of operation (Fig. 3.1.2). The processor uses die temperature to estimate power and energy consumption in order to maximize performance."
694543,15237,8494,A high-voltage-tolerant stimulator realized in the low-voltage CMOS process for cochlear implant,2014,"A biomedical stimulator with four high-voltage- tolerant output channels, combined with on-chip positive high voltage generator, is proposed. For the purpose of integration with other circuit blocks into a system-on-chip (SoC) for cochlear implant biomedical applications, this design has been realized with the 1.8-V/3.3-V transistors in a 0.18-µm CMOS process. This stimulator only needs one single supply voltage of 1.8 V, but the maximum stimulation voltage can be as high as 7 V. The dynamic bias technique and stacked MOS configuration are used to implement this stimulator in the low-voltage CMOS process, without causing the issues of electrical overstress and gate-oxide reliability during circuit operation. I. INTRODUCTION System-on-chips (SoC) for medical applications, such as retinal prosthesis (1) and epileptic seizure controller (2), had been proposed to implant into human body. The cochlear implant system is also one kind of medical applications for the profound deafness (3). Cochlear implant system is based on stimulating surviving auditory nerve in the inner ear to restore the hearing of deaf persons (4). The cochlear implant SoC for implanting into the human ear is illustrated in Fig. 1. The output from the stimulator is requested to provide adjustable high voltage to the electrodes those are implanted into the cochlea. The stimulator of the cochlear implant system may have a single channel or multiple channels, monopolar or bipolar stimulation, monophasic or biphasic pulse, and constant-current mode or constant-voltage mode (1), (5). The well-developed CMOS processes had been attractive to realize the implantable device for biomedical electronic applications. When the operation voltage of the stimulator is higher than the device normal operating voltage of a low-voltage CMOS process, the stimulator was usually implemented in the high- voltage CMOS process (6). From the biomedical application in our cochlear implant project, a stimulator with four-channel outputs in bipolar fashion, biphasic pulse, and constant-voltage mode is requested. According to the request of our biomedical project for cochlear implant, the required maximum voltage for stimulation is as high as 7 V. For SoC integration purpose, the other circuit blocks including data converter, DSP processor, and filters in the implant SoC device are all designed and realized in low-voltage CMOS process to reduce power consumption. So, the stimulator combined with high voltage generator implemented in low-voltage CMOS process is needed (7). Before any human test, the animal test to verify the function of SoC chip should be performed in advance. To design a power efficient output stage, the loading impedance of the specified biomedical application should be investigated first. So, the impedance of the cochlea of guinea pig was measured with the implanted electrodes, as that shown in Fig. 2(a). According to the measured impedance, the circuit model of the implanted electrodes with the cochlea has been calculated as that shown in Fig. 2(b). In this work, the stimulator with four-channel outputs is developed to drive the cochlea via the implanted electrodes, and it is implemented in a 0.18-µm 1.8-V/3.3-V CMOS process."
2255429,15237,8494,Optimal coil size ratios for wireless power transfer applications,2014,"Optimization of coil sizes for wireless power transfer applications has a significant impact on the range and efficiency of the wireless power system. Often it is difficult to accurately analyze how a set of coils will perform before they are constructed due to the complexity of approximating the parasitic components and coupling coefficients associated with the coils. Also, for certain wireless power applications such as consumer electronic devices, implanted medical devices and industrial equipment that have physical constraints on the size and shape of the coils, it can be a difficult and time-consuming process to design and evaluate several different coil configurations for optimal range and efficiency. This paper provides simplified design equations to accurately calculate the self inductance, capacitance, resistance, quality factor and coupling coefficient in terms of coil geometries for flat, spiral coils. Experimental results validate the analysis and a design example is provided to optimize the size of a transmit coil for maximum range and wireless power efficiency to a 5.8cm receive coil used in a four-element wireless power transfer system. I. INTRODUCTION The growing number of wireless power transfer (WPT) applications demand highly efficient WPT at ranges well beyond those of commercially available wireless charging pads, which require physical contact between the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) coil. The successful implementation of contactless wireless power hinges on convenience for the user and compliance with safety and regulatory standards. Maximizing WPT efficiency enables lower transmitted power, thereby decreasing the field strength of emissions, maintaining low coil temperatures, and facilitating regulatory compliance for any application. Two critical parameters for long range and highly efficient WPT between two coils are the quality factor Q for each coil and the coupling coefficient k between the coils. High Q and stronger k between two coils results in greater efficiency at a longer WPT range (1). However, high Q does not necessarily imply high k, especially if the Tx and Rx coils are not equally sized. The size and geometry of the Tx and Rx coils significantly impact both Q and k independently. In this work, a flat, spiral multi-turn coil topology is considered due to the wide range of applications that can physically accommodate such a coil. Extensive prior work has provided expressions for the inductance L, resistance R, and capacitanceC for lumped modeling of flat spiral coils in terms of the coil geometry (2), (3), (4), and outlined optimization techniques for coil design using Litz wire to minimize the skin effect (5) and for biomedical applications (6). However, these expressions and techniques are typically complex, computa- tionally intensive, and can be inaccurate for a wide range of coil sizes and operating frequencies. Other work has shown how to calculate the coupling coefficient between two flat spiral coils (7). However few articles demonstrate the effects that the coil size has on both Q and k, and the overall impact on WPT range and efficiency. In this work, we provide simplified expressions for Q and k in terms of the coil geometry for a flat, spiral coil. We exper- imentally validate these expressions and prove their accuracy under certain geometric constraints. Using these expressions, we determine the optimal ratio of the transmit coil outer diameter to receive coil outer diameter D O;TX DO;RX that results in the highest efficiency at the longest range. We provide an example that uses this technique to design Tx and Rx coils that maximize efficiency across a targeted distance range for the desired application given only the maximum allowable size of each coil."
1704553,15237,9772,Cloud brokerage: a key enabler for widespread cloud usage,2013,"Cloud applications can be seen as composed of services, and the owner of an application has to identify, verify, test, and select the services of the particular business workflow or application to be implemented. This is a knowledge intensive task, which might be outside a company's normal expertise and, especially for small and medium sized enterprises, hamper the ability to reap the Cloud benefits in terms of cost savings and performance elasticity. In the Nordic markets, the majority companies are relatively small.   Furthermore, an application is no longer build once and for all since its individual services can be replaced by equivalent services that are better or cheaper, as such services become available.   This opens a market for the man in the middle that can help the companies to benefit from the Cloud offerings by looking at all aspects of aggregation, integration and customisation of services on behalf of the application end users. In many cases, this broker of Cloud services can also be entrusted the application execution phase, and therefore be able to continuously evolve and optimise the application on the user's behalf. Hence, the Cloud broker will fill the gap in the continuum from an application owner to the cloud infrastructure provider.   This talk discusses the different definitions of a Cloud broker and offers by existing Cloud providers claiming to support brokerage. This analysis provides the basis for the understanding of the mechanisms necessary for the broker in order to successfully provide Cloud brokerage. In addition, it shows that it is necessary that the methods and tools used by the broker cover the full service application life cycle, including more elementary mechanisms for Cloud service description, service governance, and service failure detection and recovery.   This reveals the close links of the broker's operation to two other essential aspects of distributed systems: adaptation and optimisation. An application needs to be able to adapt in response to service failures, but also as a consequence of the availability of new, equivalent and better services. Core to the efficient operation of the broker and its clients is their capability to increase their financial margins by always searching for better and cheaper services that can be integrated with the clients' applications. Thus, there is a need to continuously evolve and optimise the applications. This could, however, be a costly task offsetting the benefits of using the Cloud unless there are tools available to support this as an autonomous process.   The talk ends by presenting some recent European research efforts aiming at providing tools and platforms to brokers that supports quality assurance and optimisation of service compositions, and thereby indicate directions for future Cloud research."
887286,15237,8494,Segmentation-based scale-invariant nonlocal means super resolution,2014,"Zooming in/out appears frequently in video shoot- ing, which makes scale vary between frames. And object motion in videos may cause scale change of the object. It leads to the difficulty in finding similar patches and causes the invalidation of nonlocal means super resolution (NLM SR). In this paper, we propose a novel scale-compensated NLM SR algorithm. First, by considering the parameter model, the image is segmented in order to detect regions with different scales. Then, scale variations in different regions are computed based on SIFT descriptor. And patches extracted from different regions are compensated into the same scale to eliminate the effect of scale change. It is shown by experimental results that our proposed algorithm achieves the average PSNR by up to 0.678dB comparing with the state- of-the-art methods. Subjective results demonstrate the proposed method reduces artifacts and preserves more details. I. INTRODUCTION Multi-frame super resolution (SR) methods reconstruct a high resolution (HR) frame from multiple low resolution (LR) frames. They are based on the assumption that LR frames can complement each other by a large amount of redundant information. Motion estimation techniques are employed in SR to obtain redundant information. However, due to the complex- ity of motion, unavoidable motion estimation error leads to annoying artifacts in super resolved HR frame. To avoid this problem, Potter et al. (1) proposed a motion-estimation-free algorithm based on NLM. NLM SR takes the advantage of the redundancy of patches existing in images. It obtains a better HR image with no explicit motion estimation by replacing every pixel with a weighted average of its neighborhood. In the past decade, researchers made progress in NLM SR by improving patch matching and exploiting more information. Some suggest adaptively choosing parameters. The adaptive choice of parameters for NLM SR relates to the size of the patch and search window. The proper size of the patch and search window can help us find more accurate patches to improve the performance of NLM. Cheng et al. (2) proposed using mobilized search window and adaptive patch size. But the method of mobilizing search window is based on pixel and might fall to a local optimal solution easily. Some develop a new way of calculating similarities to use more available information. Patches which better represent the image char- acteristics are captured and thus the efficiency of matching those patches is improved. Grewening et al. (3) proposed"
2404758,15237,8500,A 660pW multi-stage temperature-compensated timer for ultra-low-power wireless sensor node synchronization,2011,"Recent work in ultra-low-power sensor platforms has enabled a number of new applications in medical, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Due to their limited energy storage volume, these sensors operate with long idle times and ultra-low standby power ranging from 10s of nW down to 100s of pW [1–2]. Since radio transmission is relatively expensive, even at the lowest reported power of 0.2mW [3], wireless communication between sensor nodes must be performed infrequently. Accurate measurement of the time interval between communication events (i.e. the synchronization cycle) is of great importance. Inaccuracy in the synchronization cycle time results in a longer period of uncertainty where sensor nodes are required to enable their radios to establish communication (Fig. 2.7.1), quickly making radios dominate the energy budget. Quartz crystal oscillators and CMOS harmonic oscillators exhibit very small sensitivity to supply voltage and temperature [4] but cannot be used in the target application space since they operate at very high frequencies and exhibit power consumption that is several orders of magnitude larger (>300nW) than the needed idle power. A gate-leakage-based timer was proposed [5] that leveraged small gate leakage currents to achieve power consumption within the required budget (< 1nW). However, this timer incurs high RMS jitter (1400ppm) and temperature sensitivity (0.16%/oC). A 150pW program-and-hold timer was proposed [6] to reduce temperature sensitivity but its drifting clock frequency limits its use for synchronization. The quality of a timer is not captured well by RMS jitter since it ignores the averaging of jitter over multiple timer clock periods in a single synchronization cycle. Instead, we propose the uncertainty in a single synchronization cycle of length T as new metric and use this synchronization uncertainty (SU) to evaluate different timer approaches. The timer period is a random variable X(n), with mean and sigma, μ and σ. Given a synchronization cycle time T, consisting of N timer periods, we define SU as the standard deviation of T as given by √T/μ × σ, assuming X(n) is Gaussian. Note that a smaller clock period increases N and results in more averaging and a lower SU with fixed jitter (σ/μ)."
1531660,15237,23907,The Role of Translational Circuits in RF Receiver Design,2014,"This paper provides an overview of translational or commutated circuits and their role in RF receivers. Insights are offered into the frequency translation of impedances, their modeling, and their application in input matching, blocker rejection, and channel selection. A new front end is also described that rejects blockers at the third harmonic of the local oscillator frequency. I. INTRODUCTION In the past 10 years, tremendous progress has been made in the area of RF receivers. Driven by such factors as cost, power consumption, and proliferation of wireless standards, RF designers have continually exploited CMOS integration and new circuit techniques to push the performance envelope of receivers. This paper provides an overview of recent receiver design efforts, focusing, for the sake of depth, on examples that employ translational circuits. Such circuits have created a new paradigm in RF design, helping to avoid external filters and realize compact, low-power receivers. Section II deals with the properties of translational circuits, particularly, commutated impedances. Sections III and IV review the use of translation in input matching and blocker rejection, respectively. Section V is concerned with channel selection and Section VI presents a new harmonic-rejecting commutated front end. II. TRANSLATIONAL CIRCUITS In this paper, we deal with a class of receivers exploiting translational circuits, an example of which are -path filters. Such circuits have overcome two serious difficulties in RF design: they can realize RF transfer functions with a precise center frequency, and, by virtue of frequency translation, they can provide arbitrarily high quality factors. It is important to recognize the significance of these two attributes; the only non-translational filters exhibiting a similar behavior are SAW (or crystal) devices but with a fixed center frequency and a that trades with the insertion loss. Transfer functions and impedances can be translated in frequency by means of mixing or other frequency conversion methods. The idea can be traced back to “signal scanning” or “commutated” networks introduced in the late 1940s [1] and early 1950s [2, 3]. It was proposed that capacitors scanning a signal path periodically synthesize a comb filter. Shown"
897872,15237,23593,Early timing estimation for system-level design using FPGAs (abstract only),2012,"FPGA devices provide flexible, fast, and low-cost prototyping and production solutions for system design. However, as the design complexity continues to rise, the design and synthesis iterations become a labor intensive and time consuming ordeal. Consequently, it becomes imperative to raise the level of abstraction for FPGA designs, while providing insight into performance metrics early in the design process. In particular, an important design time problem is to determine the maximum clock frequency that a circuit can achieve on a specific FPGA target before full synthesis and implementation. This early quantification can greatly help evaluate key design characteristics without reverting to tedious runs of the full implementation flow. In this work, we focus on the predictability of timing delay of circuits composed of high-level blocks on an FPGA. We are well aware of difficulties in tackling uncertainties in early timing estimation, e.g., an inherent gap between a high-level representation and gates/wires; extremely difficult delay estimation due to the randomness in physical design tools, etc. We show that the estimation uncertainties can be mitigated through a carefully characterized timing database of primitive building blocks and refined timing analysis models. We primarily focus on applications composed of data-intensive word-level arithmetic computations from the DSP domain and specified using static dataflow models. Our experiments indicate that for these applications, timing estimates can be obtained reliably within a good error margin on average and in the worst case. As future work, we plan to fine tune the timing database by modeling resource utilization effects and inter-primitive/actor routing delay via variants of Rent's rule and related efforts. We are also interested in exploring dynamic sub-cycle timing characterization."
2459963,15237,20649,Relax-and-retime: a methodology for energy-efficient recovery based design,2013,"Recovery based design (RBD) is a promising approach for the design of energy-efficient circuits under variations. RBD instruments circuits with mechanisms to identify and correct timing violations, thereby allowing reduced guard bands or design margins. In addition, RBD enables aggressive voltage overscaling to a point where timing errors occur even under nominal conditions. A major barrier to the widespread adoption of RBD is that traditional design practices and synthesis tools result in circuits with so-calledpath walls, leading to an explosion in the number of timing errors beyond a certain critical operating voltage. To alleviate this effect, previous techniques focused on combinational circuit optimizations such as sizing, use of dual  V   th   cells, re-structuring,  etc . to favorably reshape the path delay distribution. However, these techniques are limited by the inherent sequential structure of the circuit, which defines the boundaries of the combinational logic.   In this work, we explore a completely different approach to synthesize circuits for RBD. We propose the use of retiming, a well-known and powerful sequential optimization technique to redefine the boundaries of combinational logic, thereby creating new opportunities for RBD that cannot be explored by previous techniques. We make the key observation that, in retiming circuits with RBD (unlike classical retiming), it is acceptable for a few paths in the circuit to exceed the clock period. Using this insight, we propose a synthesis methodology,  Relax-and-Retime , wherein the original circuit is relaxed by ignoring timing constraints on selected paths that are bottlenecks to retiming. When classical minimum period retiming is employed on this relaxed circuit, the path wall is shifted to a lower delay, thus allowing additional voltage overscaling. The  Relax-and-Retime  methodology judiciously selects bottleneck paths by trading off recovery overheads caused by timing errors due to these paths with the opportunities for retiming. We utilize the proposed methodology to synthesize a wide range of benchmarks including arithmetic circuits, ISCAS89 benchmarks and modules from the UltraSPARC T1 processor. Our results demonstrate 9-25% (average of 15.3%) improvement in overall energy compared to a well-optimized baseline with RBD."

However, most of the underlying architectures in use today were conceived decades ago, and are nowadays regarded as fundamental in their nature. Were these architectures viewed as fundamental, potentially long lasting breakthroughs when they were first demonstrated? In this session, we bring together four pioneers of data converter design to review the invention and progression of the basic data converter architectures. Oversampling analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion has become the dominant approach in high-resolution, moderate-bandwidth interfaces. In the first talk, Bruce Wooley will review the beginnings of oversampling converters and discuss the various architectural refinements that have emerged over time. Our second talk will focus on two equally important developments of the 1970s and 1980s: charge-based A/D conversion and digital self-calibration. Hae-Seung Lee will examine these inventions in retrospect and explain why these techniques remain equally valuable today. In the third talk of this session, Stephen Lewis will lead us back to the early days of high-speed pipelined conversion. While today's pipelines can easily sample at several hundred megahertz, the challenge back then was to cope with the bandwidth of video signals. Pipelining the digitization enabled the designer to extract very high speeds from CMOS transistors that were relatively slow and still getting ready for prime time. The session concludes with a presentation from Doug Mercer on high-speed digital-to-analog converters, which will review design philosophy changes that occurred in the 1990s. With the emergence of broadband data communication, new application requirements came into play, forcing many designers of high-speed DACs back to the drawing board."

The energy efficiency of electronic circuits has dramatically improved over the past two decades. At the same time, computation, storage, and communication demands continue to grow with emerging wireless multimedia devices. In this inaugural Plenary Technology-Roundtable event, experts will discuss the opportunities to achieve the next order-of-magnitude reduction in energy consumption across various domains, including analog, digital, RF, and memory. The line between analog and digital continues to blur, as analog circuits are enhanced by applying digital corrections to compensate for increased analog component variability with process scaling. As well, digital will incorporate more analog to become more adaptive; for example, to optimize operating voltages at a fine-grain to match workloads and process variations. Memory circuits will need to use a system-level approach which requires bit-cell optimization, low-voltage operation with integrated regulators, 3D Through-Silicon Vias (TSV), and process optimization. RF transceivers will continue to trend toward highly-digital architectures. The role of process-technology innovation and CAD tools will also be discussed. Future process technology will deliver new transistor structures and higher-mobility channel materials for low-voltage digital circuits. TSVs will be important in reducing I/O power and the length of on-chip interconnects. For RF, integrated inductors and transformers with significantly lower resistance will be the challenge. Future CAD tools optimizing energy will focus on co-design of packaging, architecture, power sources, and antenna to provide the best system solution.

721004,15237,8335,Accurate and inexpensive performance monitoring for variability-aware systems,2014,"Designing reliable integrated systems has become a major challenge with shrinking geometries, increasing fault rates and devices which age substantially in their usage life. The proposed research is motivated by the observation that many of the in-field failures are delay failures and several variability signatures are also delay-related. The origins of temporal delay fluctuations include manufacturing variability, voltage/temperature changes, negative or positive bias temperature instability-related Vth degradation, etc. Since the actual delay changes depend on process variations as well as workload, on-chip monitoring may be the best way of predicting them. There is a need to monitor circuit performance during manufacturing as well as at runtime to predict achievable performance and warn against impending failures. Adaptive mechanisms in hardware and/or software can optimize the trade-off between errors, energy and performance based on the feedback from runtime circuit performance monitors. This paper presents approaches for automated synthesis of design-dependent performance monitors. These monitors can be used to predict impending delay failures relatively inexpensively. For low-overhead monitoring, we propose multiple design-dependent ring oscillators (DDROs) as smart canary structures which can reliably predict achievable chip frequency but with margins for local variations. Early silicon results indicate that DDROs can reduce delay monitoring error by 35% compared to conventional ring oscillators. To further improve the prediction (albeit at a higher overhead), we propose in-situ slack monitors (SlackProbe) which can match local variations as well at overheads much smaller than monitoring all sequential elements. SlackProbe reduces the number of monitors required by over 15X with 5% additional delay margin in several commercial processor benchmarks. Finally, we show an example of software testbed that demonstrates a variability-aware system that utilizes the hardware monitors and operates with both hardware and software adaptation."
2140858,15237,8500,A 40-MHz-to-1-GHz Fully Integrated Multistandard Silicon Tuner in 80-nm CMOS,2012,"To address a worldwide market, silicon tuners have to support a wide range of frequencies and standards, motivating the use of architectures inspired by the software-defined-radio paradigm. DVB-T, DVB-C, ATSC-A/74 as well as cable modems (DOCSIS) and analog TV require low-noise, high-linearity front-ends with high-performance local oscillators. Integrability and cost dictate minimization of external components. Unlike common approaches [1,2], the silicon tuner presented in this paper features one single-ended RF input for the entire 40MHz-to-1GHz band, requires no external SAW filters or balun, and supports channel bandwidths from 5 to 8MHz. The analog IF output is programmable from 5MHz to 44MHz, supporting both modern digital demodulators and legacy analog demodulators. The receiver uses a low-IF architecture and is able to process the broadband input spectrum through the combination of a low-noise programmable RF filter, a digitally calibrated harmonic-rejection mixer, and a wide dynamic range ADC, whose intrinsic filtering nature and large SNDR make the tuner compatible with the very demanding ATSC A/74 standard. The chip's sophisticated digital back-end provides channel filtering and image rejection for the signal path, runs the RF and IF AGCs, and controls a variety of calibration schemes used to improve performance and robustness toward PVT variations. The chip has been designed in a scaled 90nm CMOS technology, requires a 1.8V analog supply and a 1.0V digital supply, and dissipates <450mW during normal operation and <10mW in standby mode. The BoM is limited to a single LNA bias inductor and a 40MHz crystal, thus minimizing the required footprint and cost."
1449382,15237,8500,A 25MHz 7μW/MHz ultra-low-voltage microcontroller SoC in 65nm LP/GP CMOS for low-carbon wireless sensor nodes,2012,"The vision of the Internet of Things with ambient intelligence calls for the deployment of up to a trillion connected wireless sensor nodes (WSNs). Minimizing the carbon footprint of each node is paramount from the sustainability perspective. In ultra-low-power applications, the life-cycle carbon footprint results from a complex balance between both embodied and use-phase energies [1]. The embodied energy arises mainly from CMOS chip manufacturing, and is essentially proportional to die area. Use-phase energy depends on both active and sleep-mode power, because of long stand-by periods in WSNs. In this paper, we present an ultra-low-power 25MHz microcontroller SoC that fully exploits the versatility of a 65nm CMOS process with a low-power/general-purpose (LP/GP) transistor mix (dual-core oxide) to obtain: i) 7μW/MHz active power consumption due to a 0.4V ultra-low-voltage (ULV) thin-core-oxide (GP) CPU supplied by a 78%-efficiency embedded DC/DC converter; ii) 0.66mm² die area for low embodied energy due to a compact converter design and a dual-V DD  architecture, enabling the use of the foundry's 1V high-density 6T SRAM bitcell; and, iii) 1.5μW sleep-mode power due to body-biased sleep transistors embedded into the converter and thick-core-oxide (LP) MOSFETs for retentive SRAM and always-on peripherals (AOP). Moreover, an on-chip adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) system controlling the converter ensures safe 25MHz operation at ULV for all PVT conditions. A multi-V t  clock tree is also proposed to achieve reliable timing closure with low-power SoC features. Finally, a glitch-masking instruction cache (I$) is implemented to reduce the access power of the 1V program memory (PMEM)."

It is the most performance and power-critical operation in programmable vertex and pixel shaders due to the large number of complex floating-point (FP) multiplications and exponentiations [1]. Performance and energy-efficiency of geometry rendering can be significantly improved by hardware acceleration of lighting computations, which is leveraged by vertex/pixel shader programs residing in the memory of a programmable 3D graphics engine [2] (Fig. 10.4.1). A single-cycle throughput lighting accelerator targeted for on-die acceleration of 3D graphics vertex and pixel shading in high-performance processors and mobile SoCs is fabricated in 32nm high-k metal-gate CMOS [3] (Fig. 10.4.1). Ambient, diffuse, and specular components of the Phong Illumination (PI) equation [4] are computed in parallel in the log domain with 4-cycle latency and 560mV-to-1.2V operation. A high-accuracy 5-segment piecewise linear (PWL) approximation-based log circuit (FPWL-L) with low Hamming weight coefficients, a 32×32b signed truncated specular multiplier, and a high-precision 4-segment PWL approximation-based anti-log circuit (FPWL-AL) enable accurate fixed-point log-domain computation of PI lighting. Five FP multiplications and one FP exponentiation are transformed to five fixed-point additions and one fixed-point multiplication, respectively, resulting in single-cycle lighting throughput of 2.05GVertices/s (measured at 1.05V, 25°C) in a compact area of 0.064mm 2  (Fig. 10.4.7) while achieving: (i) 47% reduction in critical path logic stages, (ii) 0.56% mean vertex lighting error compared to a single-precision FP computation, (iii) 354μW active leakage power measured at 1.05V, 25°C, (iv) scalable performance up to 2.22GHz, 232mW measured at 1.2V, and (v) peak energy efficiency of 56GVertices/s/W, measured at 560mV, 25°C."
1572554,15237,9836,System-level integrated server architectures for scale-out datacenters,2011,"A System-on-Chip (SoC) integrates multiple discrete components into a single chip, for example by placing CPU cores, network interfaces and I/O controllers on the same die. While SoCs have dominated high-end embedded products for over a decade, system-level integration is a relatively new trend in servers, and is driven by the opportunity to lower cost (by reducing the number of discrete parts) and power (by reducing the pin crossings from the cores to the I/O). Today, the mounting cost pressures in scale-out dat-acenters demand technologies that can decrease the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). At the same time, the diminshing return of dedicating the increasing number of available transistors to more cores and caches is creating a stronger case for SoC-based servers.   This paper examines system-level integration design options for the scale-out server market, specifically targeting datacenter-scale throughput computing workloads. We develop tools to model the area and power of a variety of discrete and integrated server configurations. We evaluate the benefits, trade-offs, and trends of system-level integration for warehouse-scale datacenter servers, and identify the key uncore components that reduce cost and power. We perform a comprehensive design space exploration at both SoC and datacenter level, identify the sweet spots, and highlight important scaling trends of performance, power, area, and cost from 45nm to 16nm. Our results show that system integration yields substantial benefits, enables novel aggregated configurations with a much higher compute density, and significantly reduces total chip area and dynamic power versus a discrete-component server.   Finally, we use utilization traces and architectural profiles of real machines to evaluate the dynamic power consumption of typical scale-out cloud applications, and combine them in an overall TCO model. Our results show that, for example at 16nm, SoC-based servers can achieve more than a 26% TCO reduction at datacenter scale."
1741336,15237,8500,A reconfigurable distributed all-digital clock generator core with SSC and skew correction in 22nm high-k tri-gate LP CMOS,2012,"As platform integration continues, different modules, including CPU, graphics, I/O interface, wireless transceivers and the power management unit, operate at different frequencies as shown in Fig. 3.8.1. In addition, maximizing battery life requires localized dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) and sleep mode support leading to independent clock domains for various functional unit blocks (FUBs). Also, clock generation units should be able to go to sleep and wake up rapidly to conserve power. Generating multiple clock signals while minimizing skews at the module interfaces is challenging. Furthermore, some modules require spread spectrum clocking (SSC), with different modulation patterns to avoid EMI, but yet such spreading is forbidden in modules requiring frequency accuracy (e.g. display interfaces). Diverse SSC generation requirements necessitate multiple reference clocks, extra pins, and off-chip components. With analog integer-n PLL-based clock generators, it is difficult to meet all these needs with a common reference clock. One disadvantage is that the frequency resolution in an integer-n PLL is limited by the reference frequency. A lower reference frequency limits the bandwidth and lock time, amplifies jitter from the reference, and increases the loop filter area. Additionally, analog PLLs suffer from unpredictable loop dynamics and clock skews with PVT, mismatch, and transistor leakage, further exacerbated by process scaling. Turning off and waking up an analog PLL requires charging or discharging loop filter capacitors which is inherently slow. This paper presents an all-digital clock generation architecture which (1) provides fractional-n capability in the digital domain; (2) implements SSC within the PLL loop; (3) performs digital clock deskew; and (4) provides dynamic loop bandwidth adjustment to shorten lock time."

I NTRODUCTION Elementary function approximations are important for 3Dcomputer graphics, digital signal processing (DSP), scientiﬁccomputing, artiﬁcial neural networks, and multimedia applica-tions. Unfortunately, elementary function approximations withhigh amounts of precision are required for many signal andimage processing algorithms.

2137675,15237,20649,A novel framework for passive macro-modeling,2011,"Passivity enforcement is an important issue for macro-modeling for passive systems from measured or simulated data. Existing convex programming based methods are too expensive and thus are ruled out for realistic application. Other methods based on iteratively fixing the passivity through perturbing the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix either suffer from convergence issue or lack optimality which will sometimes lead to unacceptable error. In this paper we propose a novel framework for macro-modeling. In addition to the traditional two-stage (fixing plus enforcement) schemes, we propose a post-enforcement optimization, which takes a passive, while potentially not-so-accurate model, as the starting point, and performs local search to find the local optimum with passivity constraint or build-in passivity guarantee. A simple yet stable passive modeling generator is proposed to produce the starting model for optimization. Two algorithms are proposed for performing constrained and unconstrained optimizations. Experiments show that the accuracy of passivity-fixed model can be significantly improved with the proposed methods.   The main problems of such algorithms are 1) The perturbation process does not guarantee convergence. Each step of perturbation, though will move some imaginary eigenvalues away from the axis, will potentially move other eigenvalues to the imaginary axis and thus introduce new passivity violations. 2) Even if the enforcement procedure stops with a passive model, the error could be large. This is because each step of the enforcement is aiming at minimizing the perturbation instead of minimizing the model error. After a few steps of iterations, the model error will generally be accumulated, and eventually it could be quite large.   In this paper we propose to perform an additional refinement step to improve the accuracy of a passive model while still guarantee the passivity. The input to the proposed algorithms is a passive, while not-so-accurate starting model. This is different from existing passivity enforcement schemes, in which the input is an accurate, but not passive system. The starting passive model can be provided with any of the existing enforcement techniques, or with some simpler (and more stable) approaches that will be introduced later.   The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the mathematical background of the problem, and review exiting methods for passivity constrained macro-modeling. Section 3 presents the framework for the proposed three-stage passive macro-modeling. Section 4 and 5 presents two schemes for postenforcement optimization. Results and conclusions will be given in Sections 6 and 7."
2483233,15237,8500,An 8mW 50MS/s CT ΔΣ modulator with 81dB SFDR and digital background DAC linearization,2011,"There is ongoing effort to realize low-power ΔΣ ADCs with more than 10MHz bandwidth (BW) — especially for wireless transceivers. Besides the trend to make these ADCs more reconfigurable [1], recent advances in the design of CT ΔΣ modulators focused on design improvements [2], on replacing analog by digital circuits [3, 4], or on avoiding costly multi-bit DACs with time-domain or singlebit feedback [1, 4]. Apart from that, the power versus performance advances in ΔΣ ADCs have slowed down, and the best FOM for above 10MHz ΔΣ modulators (ΔΣMs) is still 120fJ/conv [5]. Among other reasons, the further advance of ΔΣMs to higher conversion BWs with compatible FOM faces two hurdles: first, high BW requires a low OSR to achieve a feasible sampling frequency f S . Since the filter order rarely exceeds three, multi-bit operation is commonly employed. This requires linearization of the multilevel feedback DAC, e.g., by using DEM, which is however ineffective at low OSR [6]. Therefore, a large, linear multilevel DAC is needed, which introduces a significant parasitic load for the amplifiers and increases their power consumption. Proposed time domain multi-bit DACs still worsen the jitter sensitivity [4]. Second, the operation at high f S  makes the excess loop-delay (ELD) a large fraction of the sampling period. This ELD is caused by the quantizer, the phase shift due to finite amplifier BW [1][2], and the DEM. While many different techniques for ELD compensation have been proposed, the basic idea remains to realize a fast feedback loop around the quantizer. Alternative implementations with a summer, integrators with differentiating DAC [5], or compensation within the quantizer [1] only change the required location of the fast settling speed and high power. When implemented with the last integrator, ELD compensation makes its speed requirements the highest within the ΔΣ loop filter [1]."
1147685,15237,8500,A 6nW inductive-coupling wake-up transceiver for reducing standby power of non-contact memory card by 500×,2013,"Memory cards are widely used in electronic systems to expand internal storage area or are used as detachable media to carry data. Although cloud computing has recently drawn attention, data transfer consumes significant power (e.g., 1% battery charge of a smartphone when 10 pictures are transferred through WLAN), making local memory card storage still attractive in mobile devices. As storage capacity increases, the I/O speed should also increase accordingly. However, conventional memory cards require strong ESD protection, limiting high-speed data transfer. A non-contact memory card [1] is one of the solutions to this problem. No signal terminals are exposed for mechanical contact, which relaxes ESD constraints. A data transfer rate of 6Gb/s/ch by inductive coupling [1] and 12Gb/s/ch by transmission-line coupling [2] are reported. The post-UHS-II speed over 5Gb/s can be covered with around 10mW power consumption. Moreover, by supplying power wirelessly, mechanical connections can be completely removed, which could provide features such as waterproof capability or a new attach-remove user interface. A >50% high-efficient wireless power delivery has been reported [3]. However, it mainly supplies a large amount of active power, and the efficiency drops to ~10% in low-power standby mode. Shutting down the power delivery in standby would require a power-on sequence and an unacceptably long suspend (~10s) for each new command. For high-speed card access, the power delivery and the wireless data receiver (RX) should always be active, consuming about 2mW in RX and in total 20mW including loss in the wireless power delivery. This standby power is almost identical to that of typical smartphones, tablet-PCs, or camcorders and the battery life halves."
2213936,15237,8500,A 700MHz 2T1C embedded DRAM macro in a generic logic process with no boosted supplies,2011,"6T SRAMs have been the embedded memory of choice for modern microprocessors due to their logic compatibility, high speed, and refresh-free operation. The relatively large cell size and conflicting requirements for read and write at low operating voltages make aggressive scaling of 6T SRAMs challenging in sub-22nm. Recently, 1T1C embedded DRAMs (eDRAMs) have replaced SRAMs in several server applications reducing the cache area and improving performance [1]. Difficulties in scaling the trench capacitor and the additional process steps involved in manufacturing the thick oxide access devices are currently limiting the wide spread adoption of 1T1C technology. Gain cells have features such as decoupled read and write paths, a nondestructive read, and a 2X higher bit-cell density than a 6T SRAM, making them a strong contender for future embedded memories [2–4]. However, the boosted supplies needed for robust operation necessitates thick oxide devices to prevent gate reliability issues in gain cells. Although this would lead to a larger bit-cell size and decreased macro performance, these limitations have been overlooked in the past. In this paper, we present the following circuit techniques for realizing a truly logic compatible (i.e. thin oxide only implementation) gain cell eDRAM with no boosted supplies; (i) a 2T1C gain cell featuring a beneficial couple-up read and a preferential couple-down write, (ii) a single-ended 7T SRAM to repair weak gain cells, and (iii) a storage voltage monitor capable of tracking PVT and cell retention time for adaptive refresh control. The 64kb test macro in Fig. 28.10.1 achieves a random cycle frequency of 700MHz and a retention time of 500μsec."
1159930,15237,8500,A 0.15mm-thick non-contact connector for MIPI using vertical directional coupler,2013,"As silicon chip performance continues to increase, the interconnection capabilities should also be improved to achieve higher overall system performance. This paper proposes a new, small-size and high-speed non-contact interconnect between printed circuit boards (PCBs) using a vertical directional coupler (VDC), which has actually been applied to a liquid crystal display (LCD) driver board. The feasibility of a millimeter-range non-contact interface using a directional coupler was studied previously [1]. In this paper, two signal ports have been implemented in one coupler by best utilizing the characteristics of VDC. The coupler size is 5mm × 2.25mm, and the gap between the couplers is about 75μm, which corresponds to the twofold thickness of a soldering resist on PCB and the adhesive material in between. The transmitter transforms the data sequence from Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) into pulses in order to reduce the level of DC components. This achieves a power saving of 1.47pJ/b, and the pulses are sent to the coupler in differential mode to prevent electromagnetic interference (EMI). The measured speed was 4.6Gb/s per coupler to achieve the MIPI's maximum speed of 6Gb/s with two couplers. Conventional connectors have housings to protect contact elements or to provide mechanical support for plug-in and out. However, these housings make it difficult to achieve the smallest possible systems because they require extra space. In addition, they sometimes make the PCB trace longer, which deteriorates the maximum data rate. The method we have developed involves delineating VDC on PCB or a flexible printed circuit (FPC) to connect boards without housings and with the minimum distance. As a result, this interconnect scheme is advantageous not only because it saves space but also because it makes it easier to build systems, even those that contain a large number of built-in connectors. Thus, the proposed non-contact interconnect is suitable for future small-size systems."

As core counts scale into the 100s, on-chip interconnect fabrics must support increasing heterogeneity and voltage/clock domains. Synchronous NoCs require either a single clock distributed globally or clock-crossing data FIFOs between clock domains [1]. A global clock requires costly full-chip margining and significant power and area for clock distribution, while synchronizing data FIFOs add power, performance, and area overhead per clock crossing. Source-synchronous NoCs mitigate these penalties by forwarding a local clock along with each packet, but still suffer from high data storage power due to packet switching. Circuit switching removes intra-route data storage, but suffers from low network utilization due to serialized channel setup and data transfer [2]. Hybrid packet/circuit switching parallelizes these operations for higher network utilization. A 16×16 mesh, 112b data, 256 voltage/clock domain NoC with source-synchronous operation, hybrid packet/circuit-switched flow control, and ultra-low-voltage optimizations is fabricated in 22nm tri-gate CMOS [3] to enable: i) 20.2Tb/s total throughput at 0.9V, 25°C, ii) a 2.7× increase in bisection bandwidth to 2.8Tb/s and 93% reduction in circuit-switched latency at 407ps/hop through source-synchronous operation, iii) a 62% latency improvement and 55% increase in energy efficiency to 7.0Tb/s/W through circuit switching, iv) a peak energy efficiency of 18.3Tb/s/W for near-threshold operation at 430mV, 25°C, and v) ultra-low-voltage operation down to 340mV with router power scaling to 363μW."
1552792,15237,8500,"A 32Gb/s wireline receiver with a low-frequency equalizer, CTLE and 2-tap DFE in 28nm CMOS",2013,"Standards such as OIF CEI-25G, CEI-28G and 32G-FC require transceivers operating at high data rates over imperfect channels. Equalizers are used to cancel the inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by frequency-dependent channel losses such as skin effect and dielectric loss. The primary objective of an equalizer is to compensate for high-frequency loss, which often exceeds 30dB at f s /2. However, due to the skin effect in a PCB stripline, which starts at 10MHz or lower, we also need to compensate for a small amount of loss at low frequency (e.g., 500MHz). Figure 2.1.1 shows simulated responses of a backplane channel (42.6dB loss at f s /2 for 32Gb/s) with conventional high-frequency equalizers only (4-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE), 1 st -order continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) with a dominant pole at f s /4, and 1-tap DFE) and with additional low-frequency equalization. Conventional equalizers cannot compensate for the small amount of low-frequency loss because the slope of the low-frequency loss is too gentle (<;3dB/dec). The FFE and CTLE do not have a pole in the low frequency region and hence have only a steep slope of 20dB/dec above their zero. The DFE cancels only short-term ISI. Effects of such low-frequency loss have often been overlooked or neglected, because 1) the loss is small (2 to 3dB), 2) when plotted using the linear frequency axis which is commonly used to show frequency dependence of skin effect and dielectric loss, the low-frequency loss is degenerated at DC and hardly visible (Fig. 2.1.1a), and 3) the long ISI tail of the channel pulse response seems well cancelled at first glance by conventional equalizers only (Fig. 2.1.1b). However, the uncompensated low-frequency loss causes non-negligible long-term residual ISI, because the integral of the residual ISI magnitude keeps going up for several hundred UI. As shown by the eye diagrams in the inset of Fig. 2.1.1(b), the residual long-term ISI results in 0.42UI data-dependent Jitter (DDJ) that is difficult to reduce further by enhancing FFE/CTLE/DFE, but can be reduced to 0.21UI by adding a low-frequency equalizer (LFEQ). Savoj et al. also recently reported long-tail cancellation [2]."
1186871,15237,8494,CMOS inverter analytical delay model considering all operating regions,2014,"This paper presents an accurate analytical delay model for CMOS inverter considering both subthreshold and superthreshold operating regions. Previous related work are either only valid for a specific operating condition or assume a step input. Therefore, that is the first approach to consider both different operating regions and input transition time. Moreover, the proposed model also considers several second order effects that influence the CMOS inverter dynamic behavior. Compared to electrical simulations based on BSIM4 transistor model the proposed delay model presents an average error of 2.3% and the worst case error of 6.6%. I. INTRODUCTION The design of ultralow-power systems such as sensor networks, portable devices and biomedical applications has received great attention. Reduction of the supply voltage value (Vdd) is a well-known technique to reduce power consumption and increase energy efficiency. Even though better energy efficiency is verified when the circuit operates below or near the transistor threshold voltage, others factors such as timing performance and robustness to process and environmental variations are also major concerns when defining the operating Vdd. In this context, analytical delay models that are valid over a wide range of Vdd values are quite useful to overcome the challenges related to circuit design that explore Vdd scaling. Several analytical models for fast estimation of CMOS gates delay have been proposed to perform analysis and optimization of circuits (1)-(12). The main goal of these models is to explore a trade-off between accuracy and runtime when compared to electrical simulations. In this context, the CMOS inverter gate is of particular interest due to the importance of I/O drivers and clock networks. The main challenges in deriving an accurate delay model are related to the complex behavior of MOS transistors and existent non- idealities."

Previously a bastion for application specific wireless propriety protocols, the WBAN community has worked together to develop a communication standard IEEE802.15.6 optimised for low power devices in and around the human body offering the levels of QoS required for personal medical data. Additionally, the consumer electronic industry has migrated existing standardised wireless protocols such as Bluetooth to meet the demanding low energy yet robust needs of WBAN. This paper presents a transceiver chip for both IEEE802.15.6 Narrow-Band (NB) PHY draft [2] and Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) 4.0 standards as well as proprietary protocols. Multi-mode operation offers the best solution in terms of flexibility and interoperability between devices and networks, and the appropriate protocol can be chosen to optimise power consumption in numerous applications scenarios where data throughput varies dramatically; such as streaming multi-lead ECG or episodic temperature measurements. The chip operates in the 2.36GHz MBANs spectrum, specifically allocated for medical devices, and the worldwide 2.4GHz ISM band. A TX for the 780/868/915/950MHz licence-free bands in China, EU, North America and Japan respectively, is also included.

805067,15237,23593,Memory based computing: reshaping the fine-grained logic in a reconfigurable framework (abstract only),2011,"Conventional Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architectures leverage on the purely spatial computing model where a design is realized in the form of a small multiple-input single-output lookup tables (LUTs) connected through programmable interconnect switches. However, such a model incorporates an elaborate programmable interconnect network which becomes a major performance bottleneck and leads to poor scalability across process technology nodes. In this paper we evaluate an alternative two-dimensional static random access memory (SRAM) array based reconfigurable computing fabric, referred to as Memory Based Computing (MBC) that departs from a purely spatial architecture by advocating multi-cycle evaluation at each computational element. Within a computational element, it uses a dense two-dimensional SRAM array to map large multi-input multi-output functions as LUT and evaluate them in time-multiplexed topological fashion. Multi-cycle execution at each computing node is accomplished using a local interconnect architecture. The proposed framework substantially reduces the requirement for global interconnects by folding computational resources onto a single computational element. We explore the design space for MBC to optimize the major design parameters and compare the performance, power dissipation and energy-delay product for benchmark applications between MBC and conventional SRAM-based FPGA. Simulation results show that compared to a clustered FPGA model, the proposed framework achieves 57% improvement in performance, 30% improvement in Energy Delay Product (EDP) and 10% improvement in technological scalability of performance for standard benchmark circuits. Finally, we validate the functionality of MBC framework and timing of different operations by mapping several small applications on a Cyclone III FPGA platform from Altera."
1184746,15237,8500,"A true multistandard, programmable, low-power, full HD video-codec engine for smartphone SoC",2012,"Full HD video coding has become an essential requirement for consumer mobile applications. The functionality ranges from single channel encoding (camcorder) and decoding (video playback), to more complex use cases such as video conferencing (encode + decode) and transcoding. There is increasing demand for higher visual quality, and the wide spectrum of video content requires support for multiple standards. Low power and area efficiency are also equally critical requirements for these applications. Low power video codecs [1–3] employ hardwired implementations targeted to a specific standard and address either encode or decode. Low power is typically achieved by using single codec optimized circuitry and massive parallelism so that the design can run at lower voltage and frequency. Such an approach is not area efficient for an application processor which needs to support multiple (10+) video standards and a range of rate-distortion flexible encoding algorithms. Multicore programmable processors [5] can support multiple standards, but are not scalable to meet full HD performance of complex standards like H.264 High Profile (HP) in a low-power CMOS process, and are inefficient in terms of area and power. The approach [4] of decoupling stream processing and pixel processing, and using a 2 mac-roblock pipeline helps meet the performance, but introduces a frame delay resulting in higher latency. Video conferencing not only requires low latency but also requires encoding with a fixed limit on the number of bits per slice [RFC3984: RTP Payload Format for H.264 Video]. The 2 macroblock pipeline cannot support this requirement without impacting the performance or the bitrate. The TI OMAP 4 application processor addresses these challenges with a dedicated video coding engine built with algorithm-specific hardware accelerators."
1312589,15237,8500,A 9% power efficiency 121-to-137GHz phase-controlled push-push frequency quadrupler in 0.13μm SiGe BiCMOS,2012,"High-data-rate short-range communication and image systems beyond 100GHz impose crucial requirements on signal sources, demanding superior purity and stability. Using frequency multipliers with high efficiency and multiplication factor to generate the N th  harmonic signal that is phase-locked by a PLL at the fundamental frequency provides an alternative solution. The desired signal in an active frequency multiplier can be generated using Class B/C amplifiers, where a half-wave signal containing all harmonics is first created and then filtered to remove the undesired harmonic components [1]. Another approach is to apply the same signal to both the IF and RF ports of a mixer to construct a doubler followed by cascading to form the quadrupler [3]. The linear superposition (LS) technique that superimposes four phase-shifted half-waves of 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° is another popular scheme [5]. For multipliers with high multiplication factors, these prior techniques may offer very low power efficiency (η). Quadrupler cores based on Class B/C amplifiers, mixers, or the LS technique had been reported with η of 0.9% [1], 0.04% [3] and 0.0002% [5], respectively. Therefore, instead of improving the η of the multiplier cores, the design of the subsequent amplifiers after the multiplier to boost the η and output power has become a popular approach. We have substantially enhanced the η of a frequency quadrupler core using a phase-controlled push-push (PCPP) technique to directly synthesize the 4 th  harmonic. We noted that in an ideal situation, the proposed quadrupler circuit is able to generate almost no other harmonics, attaining an η of 50%. In this paper, we present a 121-to-137GHz frequency quadrupler based on a 0.13μm SiGe BiCMOS process. For the purpose of measurement, a balun coupled with buffers to provide the differential signals is also designed. The DC power consumptions of the quadrupler core and input buffers are 6.4mW and 28.8mW, respectively. Our demonstrated quadrupler core is able to achieve 9% (1.6% including input buffers) power efficiency at 1.6V, with a −2.4dBm output signal."

This has driven the rapid deployment of multiple broadband access solutions including legacy infrastructure driven DSL and cable, the almost limitless bandwidth provided by optical fiber to the home (FTTH), and the on-the-go appeal of wireless solutions including 3G/4G cellular or WiMAX. Over the past two decades, each of these technologies has successfully competed for the consumer's dollar, partly due to the differentiated ways data is accessed tel evisions were naturally connected to the CATV infrastructure and cell phones were linked to a wireless basestation. These traditional boundaries are blurring as cell phone calls are placed over WiFi networks and video content is delivered via an ISP. The common denominator is data access and the delivery method is irrelevant to the end user. As DSL continues to compete with cable and FTTH in the wireline space, more and more users are choosing wireless broadband solutions such as 3G, 4G, or WiMAX even for their home access. In this panel, we will review the good, the bad, and the ugly aspects of the recent history of broadband evolution and provide a vision of the future. What are the pros and cons of each technology? Do we need so many competing solutions? What will be the successful business models in the future will everyone (or anyone) make money? Which ones will be the winners ten years from now? Experts from academia, chip suppliers, and broadband systems vendors will share their visions on future broadband markets and technologies. Take your seat and enjoy the debate."
2464668,15237,8500,A 100Mphoton/s time-resolved mini-silicon photomultiplier with on-chip fluorescence lifetime estimation in 0.13μm CMOS imaging technology,2012,"Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) is a technique whereby low-light signals are recorded with picosecond timing resolution relative to a synchronized optical impulse excitation, in order to extract the characteristic fluorescence decay constant, or lifetime [1]. Typical TCSPC apparatus includes a pulsed optical source, a discrete detector such as an avalanche photodiode (APD) or photomultiplier tube (PMT), external time-to-digital conversion (TDC) hardware and a PC to compute the decay constant, resulting in a bulky, expensive and power-hungry acquisition system. A major limitation of this approach is the restrictively low photon count limit of 1-to-5% of the excitation rate, which is necessary in order to avoid distortion due to photon ‘pile-up’ caused by both long detector dead-time and the inability of the TDC hardware to process more than one event per excitation period. As such, promising applications of TCSPC including cell cytometry, confocal microscopy, high throughput screening (HTS), and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are severely limited by peak acquisition rates of 1MHz. Although 100MHz has been achieved [2], the approach used is restricted to fluorescent dyes with lifetimes less than 2ns. Recent advances in single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) and on-chip TDCs manufactured in standard CMOS processes have enabled TCSPC measurements to be performed by an imaging array [3]; however such devices produce data at over 25Gb/s, have low fill factors of ∼2% and pixel update rates are limited. Time-gated lifetime sensing significantly reduces the data bandwidth and processing time [4,5], but is photon inefficient and still limited by pile-up."
1434422,15237,23907,Scaling challenges of NAND flash memory and hybrid memory system with storage class memory & NAND flash memory,2013,"This paper summarizes the scaling challenges of the conventional 2D floating-gate cell NAND flash memories [1, 2]. The scaling trends and limits of the bulk and SOI NAND flash memories are investigated in terms of short channel effects and channel boosting leakage from 20nm to below 10nm generation using 3D-device simulation. In the bulk NAND cell, 13nm generation is the scaling limit for realizing both channel boosting during program-inhibit and SCE suppression. The SOI NAND cell scaling limit is decreased to 8nm generation. Then, scaling problems and device design for 3D-stackable NAND flash memory are investigated [3]. Control gate length (L g ) and spacing (L space ) are paid attention since they can be separately varied in 3D NAND and significantly affect the cell area of the 3D NAND as well as the electrical characteristics. L g  and L space  should be the same to cope with the tradeoff between memory window and disturbance. If the number of stacked layers is 18 with the layer pitch of 40nm, the effective cell size of the 3D NAND corresponds to that of 15nm planar NAND technology. Then, this paper discusses an error prediction (EP) low density parity check (LDPC) error correcting code (ECC) which realizes an over 10-times extended lifetime [4, 5]. As the design rule shrinks, the floating gate (FG)-FG capacitive coupling among neighboring memory cells seriously degrades the memory cell reliability. The EP-LDPC ECC calibrates the inter-cell coupling without access time penalty. Finally, this paper overviews a state-of-the-art hybrid memory solution with storage class memory (SCM) and NAND flash memory for the big data solid-state storage system [5, 6]. Data fragmentation of MLC NAND flash memory is suppressed and efficient MLC NAND flash usage is realized by storing small hot data to SCM. The 3D TSV hybrid SSD realizes 11 times performance increase, 6.9 times endurance enhancement and 93% write energy reduction."
936558,15237,20649,SALSA: systematic logic synthesis of approximate circuits,2012,"Approximate computing has emerged as a new design paradigm that exploits the inherent error resilience of a wide range of application domains by allowing hardware implementations to forsake exact Boolean equivalence with algorithmic specifications. A slew of manual design techniques for approximate computing have been proposed in recent years, but very little effort has been devoted to design automation.   We propose SALSA, a  S ystematic methodology for  A utomatic  L ogic  S ynthesis of  A pproximate circuits. Given a golden RTL specification of a circuit and a quality constraint that defines the amount of error that may be introduced in the implementation, SALSA synthesizes an approximate version of the circuit that adheres to the pre-specified quality bounds. We make two key contributions: (i) the rigorous formulation of the problem of approximate logic synthesis, enabling the generation of circuits that are correct by construction, and (ii) mapping the problem of approximate synthesis into an equivalent traditional logic synthesis problem, thereby allowing the capabilities of existing synthesis tools to be fully utilized for approximate logic synthesis. In order to achieve these benefits, SALSA encodes the quality constraints using logic functions called  Q-functions , and captures the flexibility that they engender as  Approximation Don't Cares  (ADCs), which are used for circuit simplification using traditional don't care based optimization techniques. We have implemented SALSA using two off-the-shelf logic synthesis tools - SIS and Synopsys Design Compiler. We automatically synthesize approximate circuits ranging from arithmetic building blocks (adders, multipliers, MAC) to entire datapaths (DCT, FIR, IIR, SAD, FFT Butterfly, Euclidean distance), demonstrating scalability and significant improvements in area (1.1X to 1.85X for tight error constraints, and 1.2X to 4.75X for relaxed error constraints) and power (1.15X to 1.75X for tight error constraints, and 1.3X to 5.25X for relaxed error constraints)."
2230996,15237,23593,The VTR project: architecture and CAD for FPGAs from verilog to routing,2012,"To facilitate the development of future FPGA architectures and CAD tools -- both embedded programmable fabrics and pure-play FPGAs -- there is a need for a large scale, publicly available software suite that can synthesize circuits into easily-described hypothetical FPGA architectures. These circuits should be captured at the HDL level, or higher, and pass through logical and physical synthesis. Such a tool must provide detailed modelling of area, performance and energy to enable architecture exploration. As software flows themselves evolve to permit design capture at ever higher levels of abstraction, this downstream full-implementation flow will always be required. This paper describes the current status and new release of an ongoing effort to create such a flow - the 'Verilog to Routing' (VTR) project, which is a broad collaboration of researchers. There are three core tools: ODIN II for Verilog Elaboration and front-end hard-block synthesis, ABC for logic synthesis, and VPR for physical synthesis and analysis. ODIN II now has a simulation capability to help verify that its output is correct, as well as specialized synthesis at the elaboration step for multipliers and memories. ABC is used to optimize the 'soft' logic of the FPGA. The VPR-based packing, placement and routing is now fully timing-driven (the previous release was not) and includes new capability to target complex logic blocks. In addition we have added a set of four large benchmark circuits to a suite of previously-released Verilog HDL circuits. Finally, we illustrate the use of the new flow by using it to help architect a floating-point unit in an FPGA, and contrast it with a prior, much longer effort that was required to do the same thing."
1439479,15237,8500,A 0.026mm 2 5.3mW 32-to-2000MHz digital fractional-N phase locked-loop using a phase-interpolating phase-to-digital converter,2013,"Recent innovations in semiconductor processes have accelerated the transition from analog circuits to their digital counterparts, with digital PLLs (DPLLs) being an example of this trend [1]. All-digital or fully synthesizable approaches, which exploit the merits of advanced processes, suffer from poor noise performance and high power consumption [2]. On the other hand, hybrid approaches, which employ analog components such as digital-to-analog converters (DACs), digital-to-time converters, phase interpolators (PIs) and regulators, have the typical difficulties associated with analog circuits, such as low output resistance, small voltage headroom and large variation. In this paper, we propose a highly digital architecture for a DPLL - one which minimizes the design effort typically required for analog circuits. The power and area-consuming circuits in prior works are replaced by power and area-efficient circuits with competitive performance. For example, a conventional time-to-digital converter (TDC) usually occupies considerable chip area in order to maximize input dynamic range with precise resolution [1]. Instead, in this work, a time-windowed phase-to-digital converter using interpolated DCO phases as a phase reference is adopted. In addition, conventional synchronous counters in the feedback path drastically increase the power consumption. Furthermore, retiming of data from the TDC is unavoidable due to the meta-stability of the sampling flip-flops [1]. The proposed divider scheme, which is composed of a multi-modulus frequency divider and a dead-zone-free phase and frequency detector (PFD), eliminates the need for a synchronous counter and retiming circuits. A calibration-free ΔΣ modulator (DSM) noise canceller is also included."
753337,15237,8500,A 13.56MHz fully integrated 1X/2X active rectifier with compensated bias current for inductively powered devices,2013,"Wireless power transfer has a broad range of applications ranging from mobile phone chargers to biomedical implants. For cochlear implants [1] and retinal prostheses [2], having a miniaturized form factor and being battery-less are highly desirable. Such devices require real-time power transfer in the range of 10 to 100mW [3], and as human tissue specific absorption rate (SAR) increases with frequency, inductively-coupled power links that operate at 13.56MHz or lower in ISM bands are commonly used, as shown in Fig. 4.2.1. However, lower transmission frequency means larger matching and filtering capacitors that are bulky. In addition, the received AC input amplitude V AC,Peak  would fluctuate due to changes in distance and orientation between the coupling coils. Hence, comparator- controlled power switches (active diodes) are used to replace diodes so that the rectifier could work at a lower V AC,Peak  and still achieve a high voltage conversion ratio (VCR) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) [4]. In this research, we present the first fully integrated 1X/2X active rectifier in the 30mW range with all capacitors fabricated on-chip, also shown in Fig. 4.2.1. This is made possible by a switching arrangement that avoids connecting the output capacitors in series in the 2X mode. Reverse current is reduced for V AC,Peak  that ranges from 1.25 to 4V by a bias current that is quasi-inversely proportional to the output DC voltage, as explained later; and efficiency is carefully measured by the insertion of a sensing resistor plus an additional capacitor to reduce distortion."
1554724,15237,23593,Power estimation tool for system on programmable chip based platforms (abstract only),2014,"The ever increasing complexity of the applications result in the development of power hungry processors. There is a scarcity of standalone tools that have a good trade off between estimation speed and accuracy to estimate power/energy at an earlier phase of design flow. There are very few tools that addresses the design space exploration issue based on power and energy. In this paper, we propose a virtual platform based standalone power and energy estimation tool for System-on-Programmable Chip (SoPC) embedded platforms, which is independent of in-house tools. There are two steps involved in this tool development. The first step is power model generation. For the power model development, we used functional parameters to set up generic power models for the different parts of the system. This is a onetime activity. In the second step, a simulation based virtual platform framework is developed to evaluate accurately the activities used in the related power models developed in the first step. The combination of the two steps lead to a hybrid power estimation, which gives a better trade-off between accuracy and speed. The proposed tool has several benefits: it considers the power consumption of the embedded system in its entirety and leads to accurate estimates without a costly and complex material. The proposed tool is also scalable for exploring complex embedded multi-core architectures.   The effectiveness of our proposed tool is validated through dualcore RISC processor designed around the FPGA board and extended to accommodate futuristic multi-core processors for a reliable energy based design space exploration. The accuracy of our proposed tool is evaluated by using a variety of industrial benchmarks such as Multimedia, EEMBC and SPEC2006. Estimated power values are compared to real board measurements and also to McPAT. Our obtained power/energy estimation results provide less than 9% of error for heterogeneous MPSoC based system and are 200% faster compared to other state-of-the-art power estimation tools."
1638977,15237,8500,A high-stability emulated absolute current hysteretic control single-inductor 5-output switching DC-DC converter with energy sharing and balancing,2012,"Several types of DC-DC converters for active-matrix organic LED (AMOLED) displays have been introduced to date [1–4]. Single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) converters with current-mode control have many advantages including reduced PCB space and less cost for mass-production due to the use of only one off-chip inductor to provide many outputs [1,2]. However, a load-dependent stability issue has to be addressed which is due to the output capacitance and an internal integrator with an error amplifier. Recently, in efforts to overcome the stability issue of current-mode control, load-independent control converters have been developed. Although this concept works well, the inductor-current sensing and artificial ramp generation for stability still make the controller complicated [3,4]. In addition, the freewheeling current control converter requires an extra power switch for freewheeling current flow, thereby lowering power efficiency [3]. The vestigial current control converter, meanwhile, has weak points of requiring auxiliary output and an additional inductor, and thus consumes some additional power in the steady state [4]. Besides the controller issue, the previous converters when operating with a large step-up ratio, usually have heavy voltage stress applied to the inductor, resulting in a low efficiency [1,4]. To overcome these problems, the proposed SIMO converter employs emulated absolute current hysteretic control, which uses full current information and is characterized by intrinsic high stability. The energy sharing capacitor is also used for high output voltage to reduce the voltage swing of the switching node and the associated loss. In addition, to balance the total energy across the inductor, the energy balancing capacitor is adopted."
882003,15237,8500,A 4.5Tb/s 3.4Tb/s/W 64×64 switch fabric with self-updating least-recently-granted priority and quality-of-service arbitration in 45nm CMOS,2012,"High-speed and low-power routers form the basic building blocks of on-die interconnect fabrics that are critical to overall throughput and energy efficiency of high performance systems [1,2]. Conventional routers use distinct logic blocks for routing data and handling arbitration [3,4]. At higher radices, connections between these blocks become a bottleneck, limiting router scalability and degrading performance. Recently, two switch topologies [5,6] merged the data-routing fabric with arbitration control, avoiding this bottleneck. However, [6] relies on centralized control for channel allocation, limiting performance, while [5] is restricted to a small set of fixed priorities, rendering input ports prone to starvation. In addition, ever larger CMPs will require continued increases in bandwidth over previous designs. To address these issues, we present a 64×64 single-stage swizzle-switch network (SSN) with 128b data buses (8192 total input/output wires). The SSN can connect any input to any output, including multicast. It has a peak measured throughput of 4.5Tb/s at 1.1V in 45nm SOI CMOS at 25°C. The SSN's key features are: 1) a single-cycle least-recently-granted (LRG) priority arbitration technique that reuses the already present input and output data buses and their drivers and sense amps; 2) an additional 4-level message-based priority arbitration for quality of service (QoS) with 2% logic and 3% wiring overhead; 3) a bidirectional bitline repeater that allows the router to scale to >8000 wires. These features result in a compact fabric (4.06mm 2 ) with throughput gain of 2.1× over [5] at 3.4Tb/s/W efficiency, which improves to 7.4Tb/s/W at 600mV."

A number of case studies based on representative assays and laboratory procedures will be interspersed in appropriate places throughout the tutorial. Basic concepts in micro-fabrication techniques will also be discussed. Attendees will next learn about CAD and reconfiguration aspects of digital microfluidic biochips. Synthesis tools will be described to map assay protocols from the lab bench to a droplet-based microfluidic platform and generate an optimized schedule of bioassay operations, the binding of assay operations to functional units, and the layout and droplet-flow paths for the biochip.

Cyber-physical integration using low-cost sensors and adaptive control, software will be highlighted. Cost-effective testing techniques will be described to detect faults after manufacture and during field operation. On-line and off-line reconfiguration techniques will be presented to easily bypass faults once they are detected. The problem of mapping a small number of chip pins to a large number of array electrodes will also be covered.

1428928,15237,8500,A 90nm CMOS 5Mb/s crystal-less RF transceiver for RF-powered WSN nodes,2012,"RF-powered transponders provide a low-cost and potentially free-of-maintenance solution for wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. By combining sensing functionalities and batteryless (RFID-like) wireless connectivity, these devices provide a viable option for all those scenarios in which node battery replacement is impractical because of either a huge number of deployed devices or inaccessible node placement. Extension of the reading range is a key design issue for RF-powered WSNs. When a backscattering-based passive RFID approach is adopted, the downlink reading range is limited by the power threshold of the input rectifier, whereas the uplink range is limited by the reader self-jamming. As increasingly efficient RF-to-DC power conversion schemes are being introduced, the uplink power budget will likely be the bottleneck of future passive RFID systems [1]. Replacing backscattering with an active transmission scheme can overcome such limitation. Several works have been reported so far following this approach. Asymmetric RF links with UWB uplink transmission have been proposed [2–4] with the aim of achieving both high data rates and low current consumption through very simple (crystal-less) circuit architectures at the sensor node side. However, adopting a UWB transmission approach considerably challenges the receiver section of the reader, thus potentially resulting in a net increase of the overall system complexity [5]. This is particularly critical in the case of mobile readers. Batteryless telemetry nodes with narrowband active transmission have also been demonstrated in [6] and [7]. Nevertheless, these circuits are not suitable for advanced communication functionalities (e.g., tag addressing, polling or control) due to the lack of a proper receiver section."

Furthermore, the crowded spectrum requires high linearity receivers to enable co-existence in the 2.4GHz ISM band. Inductorless LNA designs have been studied to make use of the excess f T  in advanced CMOS technologies to lower cost [1]. However, an inductively tuned LNA has the advantage of improved out-of-band rejection, and can be readily integrated with a transmit/receive (T/R) switch to provide isolation in the TX mode without the need for additional inductors [2]. In this paper, a 2.5GHz fully differential tuned LNA with integrated T/R switch is designed in a High-K metal gate 32nm digital CMOS process, and packaged in an SoC-compatible flip-chip package. Reliability constraints of the package severely limit the ability to depopulate soldering bumps, and RF components must be designed taking the bump location into account. The LNA achieves a 3.5dB NF, −5dBm P 1dB  at 2.5GHz while drawing 11mA from a 1.8V supply. LNA performance is enabled by (1) use of a push-pull topology that exploits the equal strength of p and n transistors to improve linearity, (2) use of nested coupled inductors (NCI) for low-noise input matching and to reduce area. The T/R switch handles 34dBm of power with an insertion loss of 1.1dB at 2.5GHz. T/R switch performance is enabled by (1) reuse of LNA gate inductor to enable low RX mode loss [2], (2) use of remote body-contacted TX switch with high power handling and ESD protection for a transformer-coupled PA."
715288,15237,8500,A multiband multimode transmitter without driver amplifier,2012,"Fourth-generation mobile devices use wide channel bandwidths and OFDM modulation to achieve high data rates. In particular, OFDM modulation in LTE20 creates up to 100 Resource Blocks (RB) each containing 12 subcarriers with 15kHz spacing, spread over the channel bandwidth. For an RB with frequency offset f s  from the LO, transmitter non-linearity causes counter-intermodulation (CIM) products at −3f s , +5f s , −7f s , … from the LO. These spurious signals directly, or through remixing due to PA non-linearity, may fall on other bands. The worst case is when one or just a few RBs are transmitted at the edge of the channel. The CIM effect, specific to 4G signals, makes the design of multimode transmitters more challenging since such transmitters also need to meet the substantially different 2G and 3G requirements. Previous works on LTE have mainly focused on the stringent RX-band noise and ACLR requirements for SAW-less transmitter design without discussing the CIM performance [1]. CIM terms are first generated by mixers. A drive amplifier (DA) placed after the mixers will cause these terms to be regenerated due to high-level harmonic sidebands. DA noise contribution can also be significant, especially at low output power. If current-mode mixers are employed, the use of a differential DA may be prohibitive due to large power consumption [2]. A transmitter without DA avoids these problems while it helps reduce die area and power consumption. This paper describes a multi-mode multiband DA-less transmitter which meets the counter-intermodulation and RX-band noise requirements for SAW-less operation for 2G, 3G and 4G standards while avoiding excessive power consumption, as reported in [3,4]."
2202215,15237,8494,Efficient symbol reliability based decoding for QCNB-LDPC codes,2014,"Abstract —As an extension of binary low-density parity-check(LDPC) codes, non-binary LDPC (NB-LDPC) codes show signif-icantly better performance when the code length is moderateor small. Recently, enhanced iterative hard reliability based(EIHRB) decoding algorithm is proposed to reduce the com-putation complexity. However, the EIHRB algorithm suffers alot from signiﬁcant performance degradation when the columnweight is small. In this paper, a symbol reliability based (SRB)decoding algorithm, which also performs well when the columnweight is low, is proposed for NB-LDPC decoding to improvethe decoding performance. With the same maximum iterationnumber, around 0.38 dB extra coding gain is achieved. Fur-thermore, the corresponding efﬁcient decoder architecture isproposed. Comparison results have shown that the proposed SRBalgorithm can not only achieve good coding gain, but the costfor hardware implementation is reasonable. I. I NTRODUCTION B INARY low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, redis-covered by Gallager in 1962 [1], have shown great ca-pabilities in approaching Shannon capacity. Non-binay LDPC(NB-LDPC) codes, which can be treated as an extension oftheir binary counterparts in ﬁnite ﬁelds with order higherthan 2, were ﬁrst investigated by Davey and MacKay [2].Having the capabilities of correcting symbol-wise errors, NB-LDPC codes have demonstrated advantages over binary onesin recovering channel impairments [3]. However, the codinggain introduced by NB-LDPC codes comes along with drasticincrease of the decoding complexity.The optimal but most complex decoding algorithm is theFFT-based sum-product algorithm (SPA) proposed in [2]. Tothis end, some alternatives which can achieve better trade-off between decoding complexity and performance, have beenproposed in [4] [5]. Some other algorithms, which are basedon symbol-reliability and majority logic [6] [7] [8], havebeen proposed as well.

741035,15237,8500,8-Path tunable RF notch filters for blocker suppression,2012,"The huge growth of the number of wireless devices makes wireless coexistence an increasingly relevant issue. If radios operate in close proximity, blockers as strong as 0dBm may occur, driving almost any receiver in compression (note that 0dBm in 50Ω corresponds to a peak-to-peak voltage of half a 1.2V supply). Thus RF blocker filtering is highly wanted. However, fixed filters are undesired when aiming for multiband, software-defined or cognitive radio transceivers. Passive LC filters show limited Q and tunability. Recently frequency translated filtering has been proposed as a potential solution direction for high-Q filtering [1–5]. In [1,2] we showed that by applying the “N-path concept” [6], more than a decade of center frequency range with good linearity, compression point (P 1dB >0dBm, IIP3 >14dBm) and low noise is feasible for a bandpass (BP) filter. In [3] a notch filter with a combination of active and passive mixers is applied in a feedforward path realizing a BP filter. Moreover in [5] the low input impedance of a transimpedance amplifier with feedback is upconverted to create a notch filter at low frequencies (80MHz) suppressing TX leakage in an FDD system. In this work we explore the possibility to realize a notch filter applying the N-path concept at RF frequencies and in a completely passive way. A single-ended (SE) and a differential 8-path notch filter with passive frequency mixing are presented. The filters are power-matched in the input and output in the passband and provide a low insertion loss, high compression point and also low noise property, thus they can be utilized in front of a receiver to provide rejection of high-power blockers with a large frequency tuning range."
945178,15237,8500,A modular 1mm 3 die-stacked sensing platform with optical communication and multi-modal energy harvesting,2012,"Wireless sensor nodes have many compelling applications such as smart buildings, medical implants, and surveillance systems. However, existing devices are bulky, measuring >1cm 3 , and they are hampered by short lifetimes and fail to realize the “smart dust” vision of [1]. Smart dust requires a mm 3 -scale, wireless sensor node with perpetual energy harvesting. Recently two application-specific implantable microsystems [2][3] demonstrated the potential of a mm 3 -scale system in medical applications. However, [3] is not programmable and [2] lacks a method for re-programming or re-synchronizing once encapsulated. Other practical issues remain unaddressed, such as a means to protect the battery during the time period between system assembly and deployment and the need for flexible design to enable use in multiple application domains. To this end, we propose a 1.0mm 3  general-purpose heterogeneous sensor node platform with a stackable multi-layer structure that includes a new, ultra-low power I 2 C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) interface for inter-layer communication. The system has an ultra-low-power optical wakeup receiver and GOC (Global Optical Communication), which enables re-programming and synchronization. It also includes an ultra-low power PMU (Power Management Unit) with BOD (BrownOut Detector) to prevent processor malfunctions and battery damage. The BOD also controls a POR (Power-On Reset) module in other layers to enable a proper reset sequence. Image and temperature sensors are implemented, but the modularity of the system allows end-users to easily replace or add layers to incorporate specific circuits in appropriate technologies as needed."
2073681,15237,23593,Modular multi-ported SRAM-based memories,2014,"Multi-ported RAMs are essential for high-performance parallel computation systems. VLIW and vector processors, CGRAs, DSPs, CMPs and other processing systems often rely upon multi-ported memories for parallel access, hence higher performance. Although memories with a large number of read and write ports are important, their high implementation cost means they are used sparingly in designs. As a result, FPGA vendors only provide dual-ported block RAMs to handle the majority of usage patterns. In this paper, a novel and modular approach is proposed to construct multi-ported memories out of basic dual-ported RAM blocks. Like other multi-ported RAM designs, each write port uses a different RAM bank and each read port uses bank replication. The main contribution of this work is an optimization that merges the previous live-value-table (LVT) and XOR approaches into a common design that uses a generalized, simpler structure we call an invalidation-based live-value-table (I-LVT). Like a regular LVT, the I-LVT determines the correct bank to read from, but it differs in how updates to the table are made; the LVT approach requires multiple write ports, often leading to an area-intensive register-based implementation, while the XOR approach uses wider memories to accommodate the XOR-ed data and suffers from lower clock speeds. Two specific I-LVT implementations are proposed and evaluated, binary and one-hot coding. The I-LVT approach is especially suitable for larger multi-ported RAMs because the table is implemented only in SRAM cells. The I-LVT method gives higher performance while occupying less block RAMs than earlier approaches: for several configurations, the suggested method reduces the block RAM usage by over 44% and improves clock speed by over 76%. To assist others, we are releasing our fully parameterized Verilog implementation as an open source hardware library. The library has been extensively tested using ModelSim and Altera's Quartus tools."
1655858,15237,8500,27.5 A multi-granularity FPGA with hierarchical interconnects for efficient and flexible mobile computing,2014,"Following the rapid expansion of mobile computing in the past decade, mobile system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs have off-loaded most compute-intensive tasks to dedicated accelerators to improve energy efficiency. An increasing number of accelerators in power-limited SoCs results in large regions of “dark silicon.” Such accelerators lack flexibility, thus any design change requires a SoC re-spin, significantly impacting cost and timeline. To address the need for efficiency and flexibility, this work presents a multi-granularity FPGA suitable for mobile computing. Occupying 20.5mm 2  in 40nm CMOS, the chip incorporates 2,760 fine-grained configurable logic blocks (CLBs) with 11,040 6-input look-up-tables (LUTs) for random logic, basic arithmetic, shift registers, and distributed memories, 42 medium-grained 48b DSP processors for MAC and SIMD operations, 16 32K×1b to 512×72b reconfigurable block RAMs, and 2 coarsegrained kernels: a 64-8192-point fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor and a 16-core universal DSP (UDSP) for software-defined radio (SDR). Using a mixradix hierarchical interconnect, the chip achieves a 4× interconnect area reduction over commercial FPGAs for comparable connectivity, reducing overall area and leakage by 2.5×, and delivering a 10-50% lower active power. With coarse-grained kernels, the chip's energy efficiency reaches within 4-5× of ASIC designs."
697321,15237,8494,Automatic data path extraction in large-scale register-transfer level designs,2014,"Extracting data paths in large-scale register- transfer level designs has important usage in automatic veri- fication of synchronous circuits and synthesis of asynchronous circuits. Current tools rely on users to provide the data/control partition or use state-space analyses to extract data paths. Due to the explosion of state-space, the latter method can be used in only small designs. To resolve this problem, a graphic search and trim method, which can extract data paths in large scale designs, is presented. A design is first translated into a graphic representation, namely a signal-level data flow graph (DFG), to reveal the connections between signals. By estimating the types (control or data) of these connections, a linear search algorithm can then remove all control-related signals in the graph, which effectively produces a DFG with pure data paths. Results show that this method extracts data paths of large scale designs in seconds. I. INTRODUCTION A large-scale digital system can be recognized as a large set of heterogeneous function units dynamically connected, loaded and scheduled by various local and global controllers. These function units and their mutual connections comprise data paths while the resource schedulers, including the local and global controllers, constitute control paths. Data paths are the hardware implementation of the behavioural-level data flow whose correct operation relies on loading them with the right data at the right time, which is scheduled by the control paths. In behavioural-level synthesis, data flows are usually pro- vided by users or extracted from an input design written in behavioural-level (normally sequential) languages. Data path synthesis (1) maps the flows to function units, explores possible parallel operations and sharing resources among non- overlapped operations. After data and control paths are imple- mented into register-transfer level (RTL) descriptions, they are blended with no explicit boundary. As a result, extracting data paths from RTL descriptions is actually a reverse engineering process which recovers the behavioural-level data flow buried in the logical-level implementation."
2531816,15237,8500,A Low-Power 1-GHz Razor FIR Accelerator With Time-Borrow Tracking Pipeline and Approximate Error Correction in 65-nm CMOS,2013,"The unrelenting demands of wireless/multimedia DSP workloads necessitate specialized hardware to achieve higher performance and power efficiency. Razor systems offer even greater power efficiency by minimizing static supply voltage (V DD ) guardbands for process/voltage/temperature (PVT) variation, while also providing a degree of resilience to general delay faults (e.g. SEUs). To date, Razor has only been demonstrated on silicon in the context of microprocessor pipelines [1][2]. Reported Algorithmic Noise Tolerance (ANT) circuits [3][4] operate at very high error rates, but rely on imbalanced ripple-carry adders and hence clock frequency (F clk ) is limited (50-88MHz). ANT also requires additional datapaths for error detection/correction, which cannot be clock gated in the absence of errors, increasing baseline area and power. Combining Razor error detection with algorithm-level correction enables high-F clk  datapaths and low-overheads. A 0.19mm 2  16-tap Razor FIR datapath is fabricated in 65nm LP CMOS, with input and output SRAMs, tunable pulse-clock generator, BIST logic and an AHB slave on-chip bus interface (Fig. 24.5.1), demonstrating: 1) two distinct fixed-latency Razor error-correction techniques for real-time DSP datapaths: time-borrow tracking (TBT) and interpolation-based approximate error correction (AEC); 2) a Razor latch (RZL) circuit with reduced pessimism; 3) a 1GHz datapath, an order of magnitude improvement over [3][4] due to elimination of ripple-carry adders; 4) energy efficiency improvement of up to 37%."
1378077,15237,9772,Emerging memristor technology enabled next generation cortical processor,2014,"The explosion of “big data” applications imposes severe challenges of data processing speed and scalability on traditional computer systems. However, the performance of von Neumann machine is greatly hindered by the increasing performance gap between CPU and memory (“known as memory wall”), motivating the active research on new or alternative computing architecture. As one important instance, neuromorphic computing systems have gained considerable attentions. Neuromorphic computing systems refer to the computing architecture inspired by the working mechanism of human brains. The human neocortex system naturally possesses a massively parallel architecture with closely coupled memory and computing as well as the unique analog domain operations. By imitating such structure, neuromorphic computing system is anticipated to be superior to the conventional computer systems in image recognition and natural language understanding. Among all the possible solutions, cortical processor has gained significant attention. The cortical-like hierarchical model conducts data processing by using spatial and temporal evolution of the data representation to form relationships. The straightforward hardware realization of such massively parallel algorithms inspired by cortical models, however, commonly consumes a large volume of memory and computing resources, incurring high design complexity and hardware cost. Here, we suggest realizing the cortical processor by combining the flexibility of conventional architecture in computation and the efficiency of the emerging memristor technology. Computing accelerator is introduced to accelerate neuromorphic computations with ultra-low energy consumption. The computation and data exchange are carefully coordinated and supported by a hierarchical network-on-chip across digital and analog domains."
1132984,15237,9772,New quantization error assessment methodology for fixed-point pipeline FFT processor design,2014,"Since the blooming of mobile computing era, all semiconductor providers are seeking to provide low-power, high-performance, high-compact solutions to consumers. System on Chip (SoC) is a prominent solution for integrating multiple functions into one compact size chip. However, for many new applications with high intensive computing demands, such as GPS location, High Definition (HD) video recording and processing, Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM), etc. System designers usually utilize fixed point algorithms other than floating-point algorithms as a trade-off between precession and memory occupation. One of the challenging works in designing a fixed-point FFT processor is to assess the quantization error introduced by wordlength configuration. An optimized wordlength configuration will eliminate the output quantization error in some extent, and save a large amount of memory space, which has become a crucial part of SoC/ASIC design. In this paper, we proposed a quantization error model based method to assess the output SQNR (Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio), and we thoroughly discussed a matrix representation of a radix-2 2  Decimation-In-Frequency (DIF) FFT quantization error propagation model. In addition, we comprehensively analyze and disclose the quantitative relationships among wordlength configuration, fixed-point FFT architecture and output SQNR. A new wordlength configuration method named PMBM (Performance-Memory Balanced Method) for fixed-point pipeline FFT processor is also proposed. Eventually, we testified our method in both a 256-point FFT and a 1024-point FFT using SystemC platform. The experiment results show that our method significantly decrease the memory usage of a pipeline FFT by 26% (256-point) and 30% (1024-point) respectively. We implemented a 16K-point FFT ASIC to verify our method."
755600,15237,23593,Towards interconnect-adaptive packing for FPGAs,2014,"In order to investigate new FPGA logic blocks, FPGA architects have traditionally needed to customize CAD tools to make use of the new features and characteristics of those blocks. The software development effort necessary to create such CAD tools can be a time-consuming process that can significantly limit the number and variety of architectures explored. Thus, architects want flexible CAD tools that can, with few or no software modifications, explore a diverse space. Existing flexible CAD tools suffer from impractically long runtimes and/or fail to efficiently make use of the important new features of the logic blocks being investigated. This work is a step towards addressing these concerns by enhancing the packing stage of the open-source VTR CAD flow [17] to efficiently deal with common interconnect structures that are used to create many kinds of useful novel blocks. These structures include crossbars, carry chains, dedicated signals, and others. To accomplish this, we employ three techniques in this work:  speculative packing, pre-packing , and  interconnect-aware pin counting . We show that these techniques, along with three minor modifications, result in improvements to runtime and quality of results across a spectrum of architectures, while simultaneously expanding the scope of architectures that can be explored. Compared with VTR 1.0 [17], we show an average 12-fold speedup in packing for fracturable LUT architectures with 20% lower minimum channel width and 6% lower critical path delay. We obtain a 6 to 7-fold speedup for architectures with non-fracturable LUTs and architectures with depopulated crossbars. In addition, we demonstrate packing support for logic blocks with carry chains."

The question facing us now is to determine what kinds of programmability to place on next generation systems/devices. Research and development on many applications has shown that different kinds of hardware and software programmability succeed for different application classes: powerful, singlethread-optimized CPUs continue to do very well for many applications; the General Purpose GPU is carving a niche in high throughput, parallel floating point codes in addition to its home turf of graphics; the FPGA is particularly good at variable bit-size computations and data steering, as well as parallel distributed control of networks. Future systems may well need all three types of these types of engines, and perhaps interesting mixtures of them. This is particularly true when we deal with the combined goals of optimizing cost, performance and energy.   In this workshop, we will look to the future of the FPGA within these types of 'converged' programmable computing engines, and reflectively ask ourselves: What role can the FPGA play? What future applications in areas such as networking, mobile, and artificial intelligence can be driven by FPGAs? How do FPGAs fit into the architecture realm of CPUs, general purpose GPUs, and DSPs? How should the designer/programme express their intent in the most effective way possible? What are the requirements for a compilation and optimization environment that allow FPGAs to intermix within a heterogeneous and converged future?   The intent of this workshop is to open a discussion on these questions. There will be a series of short, invited talks interspersed with free and open discussion."
1158124,15237,8500,A 260GHz broadband source with 1.1mW continuous-wave radiated power and EIRP of 15.7dBm in 65nm CMOS,2013,"Terahertz spectroscopy using silicon technology is gaining attraction for future portable and affordable material identification equipment. To do this, a broadband THz radiation source is critical. Unfortunately, the bandwidth of the prior CMOS works is not sufficient. In [1], the 300GHz signal source achieves 4.5% tuning range by changing the coupling among multiple oscillators. In [2], the DAR array has 3% tuning range with radiation capability. Alternative to the continuous device-tuning method, THz time-domain spectroscopy utilizing the broadband spectrum of picosecond pulses is widely used in the optics community [3]. In this paper, a high-power pulse-based sub-millimeter-Wave radiation source using 65nm bulk CMOS technology is reported. The architecture of this transmitter is shown in Fig. 8.2.1, where four differential core oscillator pairs are mutually coupled through four quadrature oscillators. Each core oscillator pair generates 2 nd -harmonic signals at 260GHz that are power-combined after radiating through eight on-chip antennas. Four shunt switches, controlled by narrow pulses (width≈45ps) modulate the radiation. The pulses are generated by local digital circuit blocks with programmable repetition rate up to 5GHz. This way, the broadband spectrum of the pulses is upconverted to the carrier frequency of 260GHz. Without modulation, the chip achieves a continuous-wave radiated power of 1.1mW. Under modulation, the measured bandwidth of the source is 24.7GHz, which makes it suitable for many FTIR-based THz spectrometers. In addition, if the switches are modulated by digital data, this chip can also be used as a transmitter for sub-millimeter/THz wireless communications."
2340164,15237,8500,Spurious-noise-free buck regulator for direct powering of analog/RF loads using PWM control with random frequency hopping and random phase chopping,2011,"Buck regulators are widely employed in portable devices due to their high power-conversion efficiency. However, due to their spurious output noise, they are not directly used to power sensitive analog/RF modules, and subsequent linear low-dropout regulators (LDOs) are needed to generate secondary low-noise supply rails for these modules. This results in lower efficiency, and increased size and cost. Moreover, as switching frequencies increase to reduce passive components, LDOs become less effective in filtering the switching noise due to their poor power-supply rejection (PSR) beyond 1MHz [1]. Several techniques for reducing the spurious noise of buck regulators by manipulating their switching behavior have been studied. This includes using ΔΣ or Δ modulators in the control loop [2, 3], which although reduce the spurs, result in large increases in the noise floor that mandates subsequent LDOs [1]. Other techniques redistribute the power of each spur into multiple smaller ones using random frequency hopping [4], or periodic monotonic frequency stepping [5]. However, the resulting spectrum continues to be spurious and the reduction reported in the largest spur is limited to 10 to 12dB. This limited reduction, coupled with the fact that many extra spurs are generated, leaves the load circuitry vulnerable to performance degradation. This paper proposes a pulse-width modulation (PWM) control scheme for buck converters based on combining random frequency hopping with phase chopping. The technique results in full elimination of spurs, elimination of hopping transients, very low noise floor, and minimalist implementation with little overhead on area and power."
1588257,15237,8500,A 2Gb/s 150mW UWB direct-conversion coherent transceiver with IQ-switching carrier recovery scheme,2012,"Short-distance ( Gb/s), low energy dissipation ( −3 ), and low cost (small layout area in matured CMOS processes) are required as well as compliance with spectral regulation and EMI/EMS. None of the previous research achievements has satisfied all these requirements (Fig. 26.2.6). Non-coherent UWB transceivers are typically low speed and energy hungry; i.e. 15Mb/s with 2680pJ/b in a heterodyne transceiver [1] and 1Mb/s with 373pJ/b in a direct-conversion transceiver [3]. Millimeter-Wave radio is often used to raise the data rate at the cost of increase in energy dissipation. A heterodyne non-coherent 60GHz transceiver performed 2.5Gb/s with 114pJ/b [2]. To further reduce the energy dissipation a direct-conversion coherent 56GHz transceiver was developed in 40nm CMOS and 11Gb/s was achieved with 6.4pJ/b [4]. Unfortunately, as a free-running TX LO and injection-lock carrier synchronization were employed, the injection locking range was very narrow. For an RF input power of −30dBm, the locking range was 60MHz, only 0.1% of the center frequency. Tight control of frequency under variation and noise is not easy for manufacturing. Raising the RF input power is also limited by the FCC spectral mask regulation. In this paper, we present a UWB direct-conversion coherent transceiver in 90nm CMOS. 2Gb/s with 75pJ/b is achieved while meeting the FCC regulation for indoor communications. An IQ-switching carrier recovery scheme is proposed to save layout area and energy dissipation by 43% and 20%, respectively, compared with those in the conventional Costas loop. The transceiver with the proposed carrier recovery scheme uses binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation."
1075722,15237,8500,ES5: Gb/s+ portable wireless communications,2011,"In the last few years, several gigabit-class wireless communication standards have reached commercial status, these are mainly driven by the higher demand of fast data transfer in multimedia applications (e.g. wireless HDMI, video streaming, etc.) At the same time, the number of portable devices has been increasing drastically; in the coming decade, the adoption of gigabit-class wireless communication in these portable devices will become a standard. In order to meet this demand, the electronic industry has to address the limitations of power consumption and form factor in the present solutions. Let us define gigabit class as physical layer data rate to be greater than 1Gb/s; while portability as the battery capacity limited to 25W-hour lithium polymer battery at 3.75V (similar to the Apple iPad) or about 1000mA-hour at 3.75V for a typical cellular phone. These devices offer different classes of multi-media experience, however, are both very popular among consumers. The key question is: how to be energy efficient in data-rate/power consumption for the Gb/s+device? For practical wireless application, the range needs to be at least a size of a room. In this special evening session, we have assembled a group of industrial experts in gigabit wireless communication to speak about their respective technology; and their views on how these standards can achieve lowest power AND highest data rate simultaneously. These standards include WirelessHD, Wireless Gigabit Alliance (802.11ad), 802.11ac and a proprietary short range radio.

1580809,15237,8494,Effectiveness of artificial neural network with time-varying coupling system,2014,"We have recently proposed a novel neural network structure called an Affordable Neural Network (AfNN), in which affordable neurons of the hidden layer are considered as the elements responsible for the robustness property as is observed in human brain function. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning process of the AfNN to make clear the reason of that the AfNNs can perform well for learning and generalization abilities and operate as usually against damaging neurons. I. INTRODUCTION The mechanisms of many kinds of higher brain functions become clear with the advances in neuroscience technology. Therefore, the studies of bio-inspired artificial neural networks have been extensively reported to realize such intelligence systems applying for the future engineering applications. How- ever, the performance of artificial neural networks still lags behind that of biological networks in many respects. In order to fill the gap between biological neural systems and artificial neural systems, it is important to apply these high functional mechanisms of the human brain to novel artificial neural networks. In our previous work, we have proposed a new network structure of the feedforward neural network with affordable neurons in the hidden layer for Backpropagation (BP) learn- ing (1). We named this network Affordable Neural Network (AfNN). The AfNN was inspired by cell assembly (2)- (5). which is one of explanations of multiple information processing in the brain and an information is represented by a firing space pattern of a group of plural neurons (see Fig 1(a)). In the AfNN, we prepare some extra neurons more than requires in the hidden layer. When the AfNN executes operating, all of the neurons in the hidden layer are not used at every updating. Namely, the AfNN is able to operate with high function by using different neuron patterns in the hidden layer. By computer simulations, the AfNN has been confirmed to gain better performance for the BP learning on both learning ability and generalization ability. On the other hand, am important issue is the understanding how the mammalian brain is affected in its performance by the omnipresent death of their elements in the field of Neuro- science.

In applications such as serial links, display drivers and consumer electronics, SSCG is essential or strongly recommended. Control options such as frequency deviation (δ) and modulation frequency (f m ) help to satisfy these demands. Furthermore, efficient modulation-profile generation is critical for achieving further EMI reduction and lowering fabrication cost. PLL-based SSCGs are reported in [1–3]. The ΔΣ modulator (ΔΣM) controls the division ratio [1,2] and the phase information of phase detector (PD) [3] to generate a spread-spectrum clock. The self-referenced clock generator uses a capacitor array to generate a spread-spectrum clock [7]. However, they do not have a way to control δ and f m . Dual-loop direct VCO modulation [4] and digital period synthesizer with delay-line [5] are able to control δ and f m . However, [4] requires an additional VCO, which increases the power consumption by 2×, and [5] suffers from a large deterministic jitter through the delay-line and logic circuits. A triangular profile is commonly used in many SSCGs [1,3,4]. Though the implementation of a triangular profile is very simple, its performance is poor. The chaotic PAM modulation in [2] requires complex analog circuits. Recently, a piecewise-linear profile with SRAM was presented in [5]. However, the additional memory consumes a large amount of power and occupies a large area. This paper presents a frequency-locked loop (FLL) based SSCG with frequency-to-voltage converter (FVC) [6], that saves area and provides multiple δ with low bandwidth variation.

This technology may rely on piezoelectric or electrostatic energy conversion using the energy available during the tire impact with the road. The power management system has to transfer harvested power to the load battery (few μW to mW) with the highest possible efficiency. An electrostatic harvester can generate voltages up to 40V even at low accelerations [1]. Hence, a high voltage (HV) DC-DC converter is needed to maximize the energy transfer from the harvester to the load battery. However, HV buck converters including maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms have been shown only for much higher ranges of power, in the order of W [2]. On the other hand, all reported converters working in the sub-mW power range are not able to sustain high input voltages and do not include an integrated MPPT algorithm [3, 4]. Until this work, no solution in literature is able to interface with these electrostatic energy harvesters. Figure 4.6.1 shows the block diagram of the system, designed and fabricated in TSMC 0.25μm BCD CMOS (60V option). The IC is able to interface a vibrational harvester by means of few external components: a rectifier, its load capacitor C IN , and an inductor L. The converter is consisting of a power train and its control circuits. The power train is implemented with the external inductor L, and the integrated power switches M P  and M N . The integrated control circuits have to provide the correct gate voltages V GN  and V GP  for allowing the converter to maximize its output power.

2242582,15237,8335,Algorithm for synthesizing design context-aware fast carry-skip adders,2012,"The most timing critical part of logic design usually contains one or more arithmetic operations, in which addition is commonly involved. The carry-skip adder, which is designed to reduce the time needed to propagate the carry by skipping over groups of consecutive adder stages, is known to be comparable in speed to the carry look-ahead technique while it uses less logic area and less power. Nevertheless, only recently has it become popular, mainly because of its high synthesis complexity and complicated timing analysis, especially false path analysis. In this paper, we address the problem of automatic and systematic synthesis of (true) timing minimal carry-skip adder in the context of the whole design containing the adder. Precisely, unlike the previous works which invariably assume a uniform or a fixed pattern of input arrival times, thus limiting their application to the optimization of an isolated single addition or additions in specific design structures, e.g., final addition in a parallel multiplier, our synthesis algorithm allows to accept any arbitrary, but known in advance, bit-level arrival times of the addends and generates a structure of carry-skip adder that leads to minimize the timing of the whole design. We formulate the carry group (or block) partitioning problem for minimal timing into a dynamic programming problem and solved it effectively. The experimental results with various arithmetic designs show that our synthesis algorithm is able to reduce the circuit timing by up to 16% and 10%, compared with the results produced by the conventional optimal algorithm in [1], which does not support the variation of input times and the algorithm in [2], which nearly optimally supports only a specific pattern of input time variation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is very fast, taking only 2 seconds in synthesizing 256-bit two-level carry-skip adder."
1571827,15237,8500,A 0.4-to-3GHz digital PLL with supply-noise cancellation using deterministic background calibration,2011,"Digital phase-locked loops (DPLLs) have recently emerged as a viable alternative to classical charge-pump analog PLLs [1–4]. By obviating the need for a large loop filter capacitor and a high-performance charge pump, DPLLs offer area savings and easier scalability to newer processes. The ability to reconfigure the digital loop filter dynamically offers flexibility in setting the loop response and helps to optimize the locking behavior of the DPLL [1]. However, conflicting bandwidth requirements to simultaneously suppress TDC quantization error and oscillator phase noise mandate either a high-resolution TDC or a low-noise oscillator to minimize jitter [2]. Further, much like in an analog PLL, the ring oscillator is susceptible to supply noise, which especially limits the jitter performance of a DPLL integrated into a large digital system. A low-dropout regulator is commonly used to shield the DCO from supply noise at the expense of additional area, power, and voltage headroom [3]. Alternatively, an open-loop supply-noise cancellation scheme can operate at a lower supply voltage, but its accuracy is highly sensitive to process variations [5]. Analog foreground calibration compensates for process variation but is susceptible to voltage, temperature, and frequency variations [6]. In this paper, we present a deterministic test-signal-based background calibration scheme that leverages the highly digital nature of the DPLL to adaptively cancel the supply noise in the DCO. The prototype DPLL achieves nearly perfect supply-noise cancellation over an output frequency range of 0.4 to 3GHz while consuming 2.65mW at 1.5GHz."
1350182,15237,23593,Health monitoring of live circuits in FPGAs based on time delay measurement (abstract only),2011,"Literature suggests that timing performance degradation in VLSI could be a major concern in future process technologies. FPGAs are well suited to cope with this challenge, due to their flexibility at design-, manufacture- and run-time.   Existing timing measurement techniques allow for the measurement of delay while the circuit is not operating, and reliability techniques allow for the detection of faults as they occur in operating circuits. Neither allows for the health of an operating circuit to be measured. The ability to monitor the health of a system can provide an early warning of impending failure. This information will enable measures to reduce the impact of, or avoid altogether, the failure. A good indication of the degree of degradation in an operating circuit is the available timing slack in a combinatorial circuit path, between registers, while the circuit is operating at speed.   This work proposes a new time delay measurement technique that does not interfere with the circuit's normal operation. This is achieved by sweeping the phase of a secondary clock signal, driving additional shadow registers. These are connected to each circuit node to be measured, typically those on the most critical paths. The technique is able to measure the timing slack available in the circuit-under-test, while it is performing its usual function.   The technique is demonstrated using a 12-stage LUT chain, and on an 8-bit ripple-carry adder, implemented on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA. It is able to measure the timing slack with a best case resolution of 96ps. The additional circuitry has minimal overhead in terms of area, power consumption, and timing. The increase in circuit delay due to extra fan-out load was measured to be 0.25% in the first example circuit."
821823,15237,23907,Understanding the Regenerative Comparator Circuit,2014,"The regenerative comparator circuit which lies at the heart of A/D conversion, slicer circuits, and memory sensing, is unstable, time-varying, nonlinear, and with multiple equilibria. That does not mean, as this paper shows, that it cannot be understood with simple equivalent circuits that reveal its dynamics completely, and enable it to be designed to specifications on static and dynamic offset and noise. The analysis is applied to the StrongArm latch. I. INTRODUCTION Flip-flops used as regenerative amplifiers are found every- where in electronic circuits. It is well-understood that they have two stable states, and that given sufficient time, the circuit will regenerate an input voltage unbalance to reach one of these states. The latched comparator must be symmetric by its very nature, since its binary states are symmetrical. Practical unbal- ances in the circuit arising from transistor and load mismatch lead to uncertainty in the regenerated binary output when a small analog input is applied. This problem of offset is well- known to circuit designers, and since the observed offsets can be much larger than in simple linear amplifiers, a certain mystery attends to dynamic offsets that appear only in a latched comparator. This paper clears much of the mystery by visualizing regen- eration. By using one trajectory as a frame of reference, circuit unbalances can in most cases be modelled by a sequence of linear, time-varying equivalent circuits that capture, piecewise, the variation of the circuit with time. Thus, simple expressions are obtained for all offsets, and a straightforward method emerges to null them to a desired accuracy at very small cost in power or chip area."
722959,15237,23593,Hardware description and synthesis of control-intensive reconfigurable dataflow architectures (abstract only),2013,"Field-Programmable-Gate-Arrays are used increasingly to speed up applications in various fields of science. But as modern digital designs integrate hundreds of interconnected processing and memory units, the need for a higher level of abstraction to handle their descriptions is indisputable. This paper presents a beyond-RTL concurrent hardware description language that combines both Finite-State Machine (FSM) and constraint programming paradigms. At the featured level of abstraction, the user describes dynamic connections between data sources and sinks that may not always be ready to send or receive data tokens. The high-level description methodology enables a comprehensible description of behaviors such as data transfer synchronization, exclusivity, priority and constrained scheduling by the means of logical-implication rules constraining the data transfers authorizations. Dynamically connecting resources with potential combinatorial dependencies may lead to instability or deadlock. Such situations are automatically detected and fixed by the proposed compiler that generates a dedicated control-circuit optimizing the number of transfers that can be authorized at each clock cycle. The proposed design automation methodology is applied to the problem of deeply-pipelined vector reduction. A pipelined floating point accumulator and a matrix multiplication circuits are described with a few lines of code and automatically compiled into an FPGA. Results show that the synthesis results are comparable to those obtained with hand-written RTL but with much lower effort and time."
1464305,15237,8500,A 16 Mfps 165kpixel backside-illuminated CCD,2011,"In 2002, we reported a CCD image sensor with 260×312 pixels capable of capturing 103 consecutive images at 1,000,000 frames per second (1Mfps) [1]. We named the sensor “ISIS-V2”, for In-situStorage Image Sensor Version 2. 103 memory elements are attached to every pixel; generated image signals were instantly and continuously stored in the in-situstorage without being read out of the sensor. The ultimate high-speed recording was enabled by this parallel recording at all pixels. In 2006, the color version, ISIS-V4, was reported [2]. In 2009, we developed ISIS-V12, a backside-illuminated image sensor mounting the ISIS structure and the CCM, charge-carrier multiplication, on the front side [3]. The CCM is a CCD-specific efficient signal-amplification device. CCM, combined with the BSI structure and cooling, achieved very high sensitivity. The ISIS-V12 was a test sensor intended to prove the technical feasibility of the structure. The maximum frame rate was 250kfps for a charge-handling capacity of Q max =10,000e −  and 1Mfps for a reduced Q max . The pixel count was 489×400 pixels. For backside-illuminated (BSI) image sensors, metal wires can be placed on the front surface to increase the frame rate without reducing fill factor or violating uniformity of the pixel configuration. It has been proved by simulations that 100Mfps is achievable by introducing innovative technologies including a special wiring method [4]. We now report on ISIS-V16, developed by incorporating technologies to increase the frame rate with those to achieve very high sensitivity, which was confirmed by evaluation of ISIS-V12. The performance specification of ISIS-V16 is summarized in Fig. 23.4.1."
1941918,15237,20649,Metasynthesis for Designing Automotive SoCs,2014,"Designing Automotive SoCs requires product specific support of one or more different design targets as different degrees of safety, reliability, very low power, or high current support as well as different design features as multi-core, sensor-on-chip, or system-in-package. Considering that wide design space, it's clear that EDA industry that is focusing on generic applicable tools leaves a wide field for automation unsupported.   This paper presents a novel approach to system synthesis named Metasynthesis. It proposes a new highly flexible methodology based on synthesizing system synthesis tools. These synthesized tools finally make the synthesis step from a description above implementation level, e.g. requirements, specification, or a domain specific description to implementation level, e.g. C, SystemVerilog-RTL or schematic.   The name Meta-Synthesis was chosen in the sense of a synthesis tool beyond another synthesis tool or as already said a synthesis tool synthesizing another synthesis tool. The term Meta also reflects the underlying metamodeling technique. Even if the approach requires additional effort in building the system synthesis tool, it helps to shorten overall design time, since building the tool is highly automated due to the presented Metasynthesis approach. Also the input views are fast to make since they can be kept simple and compact. The Metasynthesis approach was proven so far in over 90 different automotive SoC and other applications gaining productivity improvements of 95% considering single design steps and gaining up to 70% effort reduction for the complete implementation of automotive SoCs. Some designers report, that they generate up to 80% of the chip's overall RTL code with synthesized tools."

The described wideband RX exploits an RF-to-BB current-reuse topology, with parallel N-path active/passive mixers, to leverage such power-performance tradeoffs. Specifically, the RX features: 1) a current-reuse RF front-end with an N-path active mixer to realize most RF-to-BB functions in the current domain, resulting in better power efficiency and linearity; 2) a feedforward N-path passive mixer to enable LO-defined input matching with zero external components, while offering frequency-translated band-pass filtering and noise cancelling; 3) a single-MOS pole-zero LPF to perform current-mode BB filtering while alleviating the tradeoff between the in-/out-of-band linearity, and 4) a BB-only two-stage harmonic-recombination (HR) amplifier to boost the 3 rd  and 5 th  harmonic rejection ratios (HRR 3,5 ) with low hardware intricacy. Targeting the TV-band (0.15 to 0.85GHz) cognitive radios for IEEE 802.22/802.11af, the RX manifests favorable NF (4.6±0.9dB) and out-of-band IIP2/IIP3 (+61/+17.4dBm) under low power dissipation (10.6 to 16.2mW)."

Being memory-centric, the DLM architecture can significantly improve the overall performance and energy efficiency of many memory-intensive embedded applications, especially those that exhibit irregular array data access patterns at algorithmic level. However, implementing DLM architecture poses unique challenges to an FPGA designer in terms of 1) organizing and partitioning diverse on-chip memory resources, and 2) orchestrating effective data transmission between on-chip and off-chip memory. In this paper, we offer our solutions to both of these challenges. Specifically, 1) we propose a stochastic memory partitioning scheme based on the well-known simulated annealing algorithm. It obtains memory partitioning solutions that promote parallelized memory accesses by exploring large solution space; 2) we augment the proposed DLM architecture with a reconfigure hardware graph that can dynamically compute precedence relationship between memory partitions, thus effectively exploiting algorithmic level memory parallelism on a per-application basis. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach (A3) against two other DLM architecture synthesizing methods: an algorithmic-centric reconfigurable computing architectures with a single monolithic memory (A1) and the heterogeneous distributed architectures synthesized according to (A2). All experiments have been conducted with a Virtex-5 (XCV5LX155T-2) FPGA. On average, our experimental results show that our proposed A3 architecture outperforms A2 and A1 by 34% and 250%, respectively. Within the performance improvement of A3 over A2, more than 70% improvement comes from the hardware graph-based memory scheduling."
1003641,15237,23593,Producing high-quality real-time HDR video system with FPGA (abstract only),2014,"Video cameras can only take photographs with limited dynamic range. One method to overcome this is to combine differently exposed images of the same subject matter (i.e. a Wyckoff Set), producing a High Dynamic Range (HDR) result. HDR digital photography started almost 20 years ago. Now, it is possible to produce HDR video in real-time, on both high-power CPU/GPU systems, as well as low-power FPGA boards. However, other FPGA implementations have relied upon methods that are less accurate than current CPU and GPU-based methods. Namely, the earlier FPGA approaches used weighted sum for image compositing. In this paper we provide a novel method for real-time HDR com-positing. As an essential part of an upgraded HDR video production system, the resulting system combines differently exposed video stream (of the same subject matter) in Full HD (1080p at 60fps) on a Kintex-7 FPGA. The proposed work flow, implemented with software written in C, estimates the camera response function according to its quadtree representation and generates the compositing circuit in Verilog HDL from a Wyckoff Set. This circuit consists of parts that perform addressing using multiplexer networks and estimation with bilinear interpolation. It is parameterizable by user-specified error constraints, allowing us to explore the trade-offs in resource usage and precision of the implementation.

Optical detection, processing and analysis are considered to be of major significance in bioassay operations as this may influence the conclusive decisions involving diagnosis, detection and testing. Detection results obtained from a series of tests in a single biochip - may prompt to perform next sequence of tests on separate biochips in order to converge towards specific disease profile, diagnosis and determination of the future course of treatment. In this paper we have first proposed a design of a digital detection analyzer circuit to be coupled with a biochip for execution of prescheduled multiple bioassay protocols. The analyzer enables automated detailed analysis of the optical detection results based on the data acquired at the detection site through successful Biochip operation for heterogeneous droplet samples. we further proposed a design of centralized controller that operates on the basis of the digitized output pattern obtained from the proposed analyzer for a specific test sequence and logically determines the address of the next biochip to perform the next test sequences destined in the diagnostic process flow using an intelligent database stored in the integrated system memory. The synthesis, simulation for the overall system has been carried out using precharacterized reference data for measurement of different parameters of human blood samples and corresponding final detection results are displayed and verified successfully."
1846647,15237,8500,A 0.46-mm $ ^{2}$ 4-dB NF Unified Receiver Front-End for Full-Band Mobile TV in 65-nm CMOS,2011,"This paper describes a unified receiver front-end (RFE) for mobile TV covering the VHF-III (174 to 248MHz), UHF (470 to 862MHz) and L (1.4 to 1.7GHz) bands. The RFE (Fig. 9.7.1) is tailored to avert any external balun, or dedicated narrow-band radios, commonly found in prior arts [1, 2]. The featured advances are threefold: 1) a gain-boosting current-balancing balun-LNA addresses the imbalanced bias current (I CS =4I CG ) and load (R CG =4R CS ) conditions of the noise-canceling balun-LNA [3], improving IIP2 and wideband output balancing while eliminating output buffers; 2) a current-reuse mixer-LPF realizes quadrature/ harmonic-rejection (HR) mixing and 3 rd -order current-mode post filtering in one block, enhancing linearity and noise just where both are demanding, while saving power and area; 3) a direct injection-locked 4-/8-phase LO generator (LOG) relaxes the master LO frequency (f LO ) by avoiding frequency division. A high f LO  has been the speed limit of wideband RFEs with HR, such as [4], where a 7.2GHz f LO  is employed for 0.9GHz RF reception after divide-by-8. Here, the LOG uses 2 chains of 8-phase corrector (8PC) and 1 chain of 4-phase corrector (4PC) to optimize the phase precision in each band. A master LO in  (e.g., from VCO) injection locks either one of the chains to synthesize a 4-/8-phase LO out  at f LO . This LOG scheme particularly suits this application, as the problem of VCO pulling is irrelevant here in the absence of the PA."
1946246,15237,8500,A mm-Wave quadrature VCO based on magnetically coupled resonators,2011,"Wireless signal processing at mm-Waves would benefit from the availability of a quadrature signal reference, enabling direct-conversion transceiver architectures and providing phase rotators drivers in phased arrays systems [1]. They are furthermore attractive for clock recovery in ICs for wireline applications. Search of a compact quadrature generator at around 60GHz with low phase noise at moderate power is the topic of this work. Discarding a double-frequency VCO followed by dividers-by-two given the high frequency range of operation, the most suitable topology borrowed by RF solutions is represented by cross-coupled LC voltage-controlled oscillators [2]. However, the oscillation frequency dependence on the biasing current makes it susceptible to phase noise, close-in in particular [3]. At mm-Waves, this is exacerbated by core devices of small dimensions to such an extent that 1/f 3  noise remains dominant up to more than ∼10MHz, making it unsuitable for stringent applications. On the contrary a ring of two VCOs magnetically coupled to each other, as shown in Fig. 16.2.1, has an oscillation frequency dependence on inter-stage passive components only, low 1/f 3  noise together with good quadrature accuracy. The quadrature oscillator has been realized in a 65nm CMOS technology and prototypes show the following performances: 56-to-60.3GHz tunable oscillation frequency, phase noise better than −95dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset in the tuning range, 1.5° maximum phase error while consuming 22mA from a 1V supply."
930856,15237,9772,Intellectual property protection and security of SoCs — An embedded tutorial,2012,"VLSI designs and hardware cores are reused in order to meet the design specifications on time, considering the numerous constraints imposed by nanometer technology. Electronic description of a VLSI design or a hardware core is an intellectual property (IP), and may be infringed upon either in the design house, or the fabrication facility, or at the time of its reuse in a system. This mandates incorporating techniques for intellectual property protection in the VLSI design flow. The IP of a VLSI design, which culminates in fabrication of the integrated circuit, differs from other sources of IPs such as image, text, because in addition to its physical and structural description, it also has a behavioral specification which should remain unaltered by any IP protection technique. IPs at the design level are editable and hence more flexible for reuse yet more vulnerable to misappropriation. Security in activation of chips, especially in embedded systems, is an equally grave issue and has led to the paradigm of design-for-security. This embedded tutorial aims at presenting the major concerns in IP security and the challenges to implement the countermeasures and retain their effectiveness in the entire life cycle. The nature of threats are broadly categorized as (i) misappropriation by hacking during electronic commerce and intentional reselling, and (ii) unauthorized design retrieval. Various mechanisms such as encryption and obfuscation, watermarking and fingerprinting for countering misappropriation of category (i) will be addressed. Analytic methods derived from the behavioral aspect specific to chip designs and effective for category (ii), will be discussed. Finally, it focuses on the practical issues in semiconductor technology and IP commerce which pose difficulty in ensuring a safe cycle for an IP."
2132869,15237,23836,Efficient Nonserial Polyadic Dynamic Programming on the Cell Processor,2011,"Dynamic programming (DP) is an effective technique for many search and optimization problems. However, the high arithmetic complexity limits its extensive use. Although modern processor architectures with multiple cores and SIMD (single instruction multiple data) instructions provide increasingly high computing power, even the state-of-the-art fully optimized algorithm still largely underutilizes modern multi-core processors. In this paper we propose to improve one family of DP, nonserial polyadic DP (NPDP), targeting a heterogeneous multi-core architecture, the Cell Broadband Engine. We first design a new data layout which efficiently utilizes the on-chip memory system of the Cell processor. Next we devise a CellNPDP algorithm with two tiers. The first tier is a SPE (a co-processor on the Cell processor) procedure which efficiently computes a block of data that can fit into one SPE's local store. The second tier is a parallel procedure which enables all SPEs to efficiently compute all blocks of data. To evaluate CellNPDP, we use both performance modeling and experiments. The performance model reveals that the processor utilization of NPDP can be independent of the problem size. To empirically evaluate CellNPDP, we use two platforms: the IBM QS20 dual-Cell blade and a CPU platform with two latest quad-core CPUs. On both platforms, the processor utilization of CellNPDP is larger than 60%, which demonstrates that our optimizations and CellNPDP can be architecture-independent. Compared to the state-of-the-art fully optimized algorithm on the CPU platform, CellNPDP is 44-fold faster for single-precision and 28-fold faster for double-precision, which is a significant improvement to NPDP."
1266722,15237,8500,A compact 1V 18.6dBm 60GHz power amplifier in 65nm CMOS,2011,"One of the remaining challenges in implementing CMOS 60GHz radios is to cover longer communication distance as the high path loss at mm-Wave frequencies demands higher EIRP, which in turn requires considerable design effort on the transmitter. In addition, to comply with the OFDM transmitting mode of the IEEE 802.15.3c standards, the power amplifier (PA) must be capable to handle a peak power level 6∼9dB higher than the average without sacrificing reliability. With the low supply voltage limitation of deeply scaled CMOS technologies, efficient power-combining techniques are essential. Spatial power combining is an attractive solution to meet the EIRP goal, but at the cost of spending extra power on the complex signal distribution and in order to compensate for the phase-shifter loss. Spatial power-combining solutions also occupy larger area due to the requirement of multiple antennas, minimum antenna spacing, and the transmission line feed network. On the other hand, CMOS PAs with on-chip power-combining structures have achieved 18dBm of output power [1–3]. However, all the combiners comprise multiple stages to achieve both impedance transformation and power combining which not only increase the insertion loss and directly degrade the efficiency, but also consume a significant amount of silicon area, rendering them far less appealing for system integration. This paper presents a fully integrated 18.6dBm CMOS PA based on an efficient and compact on-chip power combiner."
667368,15237,23593,Intra-masking dual-rail memory on LUT implementation for tamper-resistant AES on FPGA,2012,"In current countermeasure design trends against differential power analysis (DPA), security at gate level is required in addition to the security algorithm. Several dual-rail pre-charge logics (DPL) have been proposed to achieve this goal. Designs using ASIC can attain this goal owing to its backend design restrictions on placement and routing. However, implementing these designs on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) without information leakage is still a problem because of the difficulty involved in the restrictions on placement and routing on FPGA.   This paper describes our novel masked dual-rail pre-charged memory approach, called intra-masking dual-rail memory on LUT, and its implementation on FPGA for tamper-resistant AES. In the proposed design, all unsafe nodes, such as unmasking and masking, and the dual-rail memory and buses are packed into a single LUT. This makes them balanced and independent of the placement and routing tools. The design is independent of the cryptographic algorithm, and hence, it can be applied to available cryptographic standards such as DES or AES as well as future standards. It requires no special placement or route constraints in its implementation. A correlation power analysis (CPA) attack on 1,000,000 traces of AES implementation on FPGA showed that the secret information is well protected against first-order side-channel attacks. Even though the number of LUTs used for memory in this implementation is seven times greater than that of the conventional unprotected single-rail memory table-lookup AES and three times greater than the implementation based on a composite field, it requires a smaller number of LUTs than all other advanced tamper-resistant implementations such as the wave dynamic differential logic, masked dual-rail pre-charge logic, and threshold."
1348801,15237,8335,Loadsa: A yield-driven top-down design method for STT-RAM array,2013,"As an emerging nonvolatile memory technology, spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) faces great design challenges. The large device variations and the thermal-induced switching randomness of the magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) introduce the persistent and non-persistent errors in STT-RAM operations, respectively. Modeling these statistical metrics generally require the expensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the combined magnetic-CMOS models, which is hardly integrated in the modern micro-architecture and system designs. Also, the conventional bottom-up design method incurs costly iterations in the STT-RAM design toward specific system requirement. In this work, we propose Loadsa 1 : a yield-driven top-down design method to explore the design space of STT-RAM array from a statistical point of view. Both array-level semi-analytical yield model and cell-level failure-probability model are developed to enable a top-down design method: The system-level requirements, e.g., the chip yield under power and area constraints, are hierarchically mapped to array-and cell-level design parameters, e.g., redundancy, ECC scheme, and MOS transistor size, etc. Our simulation results show that Loadsa can accurately optimize the STT-RAM based on the system and cell-level constraints with a linear computation complexity. Our method demonstrates great potentials in the early design stage of memory or micro-architecture by eliminating the design integrations, while offering a full statistical view of the design even when the common yield enhancement practices are applied."
641547,15237,23593,1K manycore FPGA shared memory architecture for SOC (abstract only),2014,"Manycore shared memory architectures hold a significant premise to speed up and simplify SOCs. Using many homogeneous small-cores will allow replacing the hardware accelerators of SOCs by parallel algorithms communicating through shared memory. Currently shared memory is realized by maintaining cache-consistency across the cores, caching all the connected cores to one main memory module. This approach, though used today, is not likely to be scalable enough to support the high number of cores needed for highly parallel SOCs. Therefore we consider a theoretical scheme for shared memory wherein: the shared address space is divided between a set of memory modules; and a communication network allows each core to access every such module in parallel. Load-balancing between the memory modules is obtained by rehashing the memory address-space. We have designed a simple generic shared memory architecture, synthesized it to 2,4,8,,..1024-cores for FPGA virtex-7 and evaluated it on several parallel programs. The synthesis results and the execution measurements show that, for the FPGA, all problematic aspects of this construction can be resolved. For example, unlike ASICs, the growing complexity of the communication network is absorbed by the FPGA's routing grid and by its routing mechanism. This makes this type of architectures particularly suitable for FPGAs. We used 32-bits modified PACOBLAZE cores and tested different parameters of this architecture verifying its ability to achieve high speedups. The results suggest that re-hashing is not essential and one hash-function suffice (compared to the family of universal hash functions that is needed by the theoretical construction)."
1195801,15237,23593,Low power interconnect design for fpgas with bidirectional wiring using nanocrystal floating gate devices (abstract only),2011,"New architectures for the switch box and connection block are proposed for use in an energy efficient field programmable gate array (FPGA) with bidirectional wiring. Power-hungry SRAMs are replaced by non-volatile nanocrystal floating gate (NCFG) devices that retain their state while the system power is off and do not need to be configured at boot up. The NCFG-based FPGA is benchmarked against both a traditional bidirectional and a modern unidirectional SRAM-based FPGA using a 32-tap FIR Filter designed in HSPICE based on predictive BSIM4.0 CMOS with 45nm gate length technology and a previously developed physical model of the NCFG device. Compared to the traditional bidirectional and the modern unidirectional SRAM-based interconnect the total gate area is reduced by 87% and 63%, respectively. Simulations demonstrate a reduction of 58% in static and 34% in dynamic power consumption compared to the traditional bidirectional SRAM-based FPGA while the signal propagation delay through a switch box is decreased by 28%. When compared to the modern unidirectional SRAM-based FPGA the proposed design has roughly comparable power consumption but the circuit complexity is greatly reduced as a result of doubling the available routing channels. Alternatively the number of the routing channels may be reduced to save area and power whereas the complexity remains similar. The potential benefits from choosing the proposed design can be summarized as small area, low power consumption, high speed and high functionality, which typically trade off and cannot be achieved by the SRAM-based counterparts simultaneously. Compared to previous designs that use continuous floating gate devices in FPGAs, the approach described in this work requires less overhead, lower voltages, and offers improved reliability."
1268867,15237,8500,A 20dBm 2.4GHz digital outphasing transmitter for WLAN application in 32nm CMOS,2012,"Integration of radios in SoCs along with digital baseband and application processors is desirable for cost and form-factor reasons. Digital processors are typically implemented in the latest CMOS process to take advantage of the increased density and performance afforded by CMOS scaling. Integration of traditional RF circuits, however, requires accurate RF and passive models that typically lag behind digital transistor models by several quarters. This makes RF integration the limiting factor for time-to-market for the whole SoC, or results in sub-optimal multiple-chip solutions. Furthermore, traditional RF circuits do not benefit from scaling as digital circuits do, e.g. due to extensive use of inductors, the ever-lowering supply voltage, etc. This work presents a digital WiFi transmitter (TX) implemented in a 32nm digital CMOS process to address these issues. An outphasing architecture allows implementation of both amplitude and phase modulation using scaling-friendly, delay-based, switching phase modulators. The integrated PA was already shown to be possible to design with no RF models [1]; known issues of outphasing PA design (e.g. output impedance modulation, linearity, efficiency) are also addressed in [1]. The phase modulator uses an open-loop architecture to accommodate OFDM bandwidths up to 40MHz. The TX achieves state-of-the-art performance already in 32nm and is moreover expected to: (1) improve with scaling and (2) port easily over successive process nodes."

To this end, we have designed and fabricated a reconfigurable analog neural network (ANN) chip which serves as an expertise acquisition platform for various applications requiring on-chip ANN integration. With this platform, we intend to address the key cost-efficiency issues: a fully analog implementation with strict area and power budgets, a learning ability of the proposed architecture, fast dynamic programming of the weight memory during training, and high precision non-volatile storage of weight coefficients during operation or standby. We explore two learning structures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and an ontogenic neural network with their corresponding training algorithms. The core circuits are biased in weak inversion and make use of the translinear principle for multiplication and non-linear conversion operations. The chip is mounted on a custom PCB and connected to a computer for chip-in-the-loop training. We present measured results of the core circuits and the dual-mode weight memory. The learning ability is evaluated on a 3-input XOR classification task."
1984237,15237,20649,CACI: Dynamic Current Analysis Towards Robust Recycled Chip Identification,2014,"Rising incidences of counterfeit chips in the supply chain have posed a serious threat to the semiconductor industry. Recycling of used chips constitutes a major form of counterfeiting attacks. If undetected, they can lead to serious consequences including system performance/reliability issues during field operation and potential revenue/reputation loss for a trusted manufacturer. Existing validation approaches based on path delay analysis suffer from reduced robustness and sensitivity under large process variations. On the other hand, existing design solutions based on aging sensors require additional design/verification efforts and cannot be applied to legacy chips. In this paper, we present a novel recycled chip identification approach, CACI, that exploits differential aging in self-similar modules (e.g., different parts of an adder) to isolate aged chips under large inter- and intra-die process variations. It compares dynamic current (IDDT) signatures between two adjacent similar circuit structures in a chip. We derive an isolation metric based on multiple current comparisons to provide high level of confidence. CACI does not rely on any embedded structures for authentication, thus it comes at virtually zero design overhead and can be applied to chips already in the market. Through extensive simulations, we show that for 15% inter- and 10% intra-die variations in threshold voltage for a 45nm CMOS process, over 97% of recycled chips can be reliably identified."

To lower cost and increase integration, MOSFETs in CMOS are being investigated for implementing broadband detectors [1–3]. However, neither measured noise-equivalent power (NEP) nor noise floor of the imager was given in [1]. Although NEP of 17pW/Hz 1/2  was achieved at 650GHz in [2], an external lens was attached to the 65nm SOI CMOS chip. In [3], an NEP of 66pW/Hz 1/2  was measured at 1.05THz using 65nm CMOS without a lens attached to the chip. Additionally, although the efforts reported in [1–3] realized an array, none demonstrated the image-array function. As an alternative, polysilicon-gate-separation (PGS) Schottky-barrier diodes (SBD) with cut-off frequency of ∼2THz were fabricated in CMOS without process modifications [4] and were used to demonstrate a 280GHz detector with NEP of 30pW/Hz 1/2  [5,6]. To significantly enhance the scanning speed, a 16-pixel 280GHz SBD imager is fabricated and its array function is reported in this paper. The imager including baseband amplifiers achieves responsivity of 5.1kV/W and NEP of 29pW/Hz 1/2 . More importantly, its operation was demonstrated in a setup that requires no mirror or lens that is bulky and costly. Next, an 860GHz SBD detector is demonstrated with a measured non-amplified responsivity of 355V/W and NEP of 32pW/Hz 1/2 . This NEP is ∼2X lower than the best reported work in CMOS [3]. Both chips are fabricated in a 0.13μm logic CMOS. The results suggest a path for high performance, compact and affordable sub-millimeter-wave and terahertz CMOS imagers using SBDs."
880996,15237,8494,Sigma delta feedback DAC architectures for high accuracy and extremely low charge transfer,2013,"Sigma delta ADCs (SD-ADC) are often the preferred ADCs of choice in sensor interfacing applications due to their high achievable absolute accuracy. Constraints such as low power and limited area often dictate minimum front-end hardware, thereby limiting options for pre-processing stages. Processing very small input signals requires that the magnitudes of the signals at the input summing node match. Given that often the sensor output current is of extremely low magnitude, the feedback DAC also has to transfer extremely small charges (order of a few femto-coulombs). Such constraints challenge the limits of existing process technologies. This paper investigates single bit feedback DAC architectures tailored specifically for very low charge transfers. Switched capacitor DACs are a viable means of transferring discrete charge packets accurately. Various DAC structures are compared using criteria such as absolute charge transfer error, effect of parasitic capacitances and the output referred noise. Accuracy of the feedback DAC is a major bottle-neck in the overall accuracy of the SD-ADC. The accuracy of the SD-ADC is compared for different feedback DAC structures. DAC structures are individually simulated using Spectre for 0.13um 3.3V standard CMOS technology. Based on circuit simulations, the feedback DAC is modeled in MATLAB as a combination of a `gain' block, `offset' error, additive noise and delay. A 1-bit 2nd order CT-SDM with the DAC model in the feedback path is used as a test vehicle and is simulated in MATLAB for accuracy calculations."
2196086,15237,8500,An Ultra-Low-Power 9.8 GHz Crystal-Less UWB Transceiver With Digital Baseband Integrated in 0.18 µm BiCMOS,2013,"Future biomedical and internet-of-things applications are driving the volume of wireless sensors into the cubic-mm regime. At the mm-scale, complete integration is necessary, and operation within the limits of a micro-battery becomes a primary challenge [1]. With CMOS scaling and ultra-low-power circuits reducing battery volume, the antenna and crystal quickly become the largest components in a cubic-mm node. Higher-frequency operation and silicon-based timing circuits are critical to integrate these components. This paper presents a fully-integrated 9.8GHz impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radio with an on-chip 2mm monopole and the option of wire-bonding to an off-chip antenna. The crystal is replaced with a novel temperature-compensated relaxation oscillator. Due to modern mm-scale battery limitations, the peak current draw must be <;100μA [2], far below typical radio power consumption. Furthermore, external capacitors are too large for mm-scale nodes; thus, duty-cycling only at the packet level is not an option. This IR-UWB radio includes current-limiting at the battery supply, and the integrated modem duty-cycles the RF front-end at the bit-level in order to operate from integrated storage capacitance. Finally, many recent transceivers operate at <;1V [3,4]; however the voltage of a micro-battery is 3.2~4.1V [2] and integrated conversion efficiency is <;80% [1,5]. Thus, this radio is designed to operate the RF blocks over the entire battery voltage range."
1559641,15237,8500,A 28nm High-κ metal-gate single-chip communications processor with 1.5GHz dual-core application processor and LTE/HSPA+-capable baseband processor,2013,"The increase in the use and number of smartphone devices is causing heavy data traffic volumes on existing 3G mobile wireless networks. LTE, often referred to as 4G, offers true mobile broadband. It is a new network and access technology that provides new spectrum resources, much increased spectral efficiency, higher throughputs (150Mb/s with higher rates to come), at lower latency and it uses an IP-based infrastructure. LTE is the solution to mitigate the traffic load issue and it is being rolled out around the world. The proposed communication processor R-Mobile U2 (RMU2) achieves single-chip integration of a 1.5GHz dual-core application processor and a triple mode (GSM/WCDMA/LTE) base-band processor. Key design highlights of the RMU2 are: 1) A 28nm HKMG high-performance and low-leakage (HPL) CMOS bulk process achieves an optimal balance between both low leakage current and high performance. 2) A CPU clock control mechanism, called the “power saver”, limits the CPU power so as not to exceed a threshold level and to reduce IR drop. 3) The internal power domain is separated into 33 sub-blocks with I/O NMOS power switches [1] to minimize leakage current of any unused sub-block. 4) A dual-mode low-leakage SRAM [2] achieves low standby current in addition to conventional memory characteristics."
2081422,15237,8500,A Fully Integrated 8-Channel Closed-Loop Neural-Prosthetic CMOS SoC for Real-Time Epileptic Seizure Control,2013,"An 8-channel closed-loop neural-prosthetic SoC is presented for real-time intracranial EEG (iEEG) acquisition, seizure detection, and electrical stimulation in order to suppress epileptic seizures. The SoC is composed of eight energy-efficient analog front-end amplifiers (AFEAs), a 10-b delta-modulated SAR ADC (DMSAR ADC), a configurable bio-signal processor (BSP), and an adaptive high-voltage-tolerant stimulator. A wireless power-and-data transmission system is also embedded. By leveraging T-connected pseudo-resistors, the high-pass (low-pass) cutoff frequency of the AFEAs can be adjusted from 0.1 to 10 Hz (0.8 to 7 kHz). The noise-efficiency factor (NEF) of the AFEA is 1.77, and the DMSAR ADC achieves an ENOB of 9.57 bits. The BSP extracts the epileptic features from time-domain entropy and frequency spectrum for seizure detection. A constant 30- μA stimulus current is delivered by closed-loop control. The acquired signals are transmitted with on-off keying (OOK) modulation at 4 Mbps over the MedRadio band for monitoring. A multi-LDO topology is adopted to mitigate the interferences across different power domains. The proposed SoC is fabricated in 0.18- μm CMOS and occupies 13.47 mm 2 . Verified on Long Evans rats, the proposed SoC dissipates 2.8 mW and achieves high detection accuracy (> 92%) within 0.8 s."
936069,15237,8335,Thermal-aware power network design for IR drop reduction in 3D ICs,2012,"Due to the high integration on vertical stacked layers, power/ground network design becomes one of the critical challenges in 3D IC design. With the leakage-thermal dependency, the increasing on-chip temperature in 3D designs has serious impact on IR drop due to the increased wire resistance and increased leakage current. Power/ground (P/G) TSVs can help to relieve the IR drop violation by vertically connecting the on-chip P/G networks on different layers. However, most previous work only fulfills a margin of the full potential of PG TSVs planning since the P/G grids are restricted in a uniform topology. Besides, the overlook of resistance variation and leakage current will make the results less accurate. In this paper, we present an efficient thermal-aware P/G TSVs planning algorithm based on a sensitivity model with temperature-dependent leakage current considered. The proposed method can overcome the limitation of uniform P/G grid topology and make full use of P/G TSVs planning for the optimization of P/G network by allowing short wires to connect the P/G TSVs to P/G grids in non-uniform topology. Moreover, with resistance variation and increased leakage current caused by high temperature in 3D ICs, more accurate result can be obtained. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental results show the efficiency of our approach. Results show that neglecting thermal impacts on power delivery can underestimate IR drop by about 11%. To relieve the severe IR drop violation, 51.8% more P/G TSVs are needed than the cases without thermal impacts considered. Results also show that our P/G TSV planning based on the sensitivity model can reduce max IR drop by 42.3% and reduce the number of violated nodes by 82.4%."
1578059,15237,23593,Scalable architecture for 135 GBPS IPv6 lookup on FPGA (abstract only),2012,"High-speed IP lookup remains a challenging problem in next generation routers due to the ever increasing line rate and routing table size. In addition, the evolution towards IPv6 also requires long prefix length, sparse prefix distribution, and potentially very large routing tables. In this paper, we propose a novel Combined Length-Infix Pipelined Search (CLIPS) architecture for IPv6 routing table lookup on FPGA. CLIPS solves the longest prefix match (LPM) problem by combining both prefix length and infix pattern search. Binary search in prefix length is performed on the 64-bit routing prefix of IPv6 down to an 8-bit length range in log(64/8)=3  phases ; each phase performs a fully-pipelined infix pattern search with only one external memory access. A fourth and the last phase then finds the LPM (if any) within the 8-bit length range in a compressed multi-bit trie.   We describe the algorithms and data structures used for the CLIPS construction, run-time operation, dynamic update and false-positive avoidance. The proposed solution improves the on-chip memory efficiency on FPGA and maximizes the external SRAM utilization; additional properties for ensuring the practicality of our scheme include the modular construction, easy dynamic update, and simple resource allocation. Using a state-of-the-art FPGA, our CLIPS prototype supports up to 2.7 millioin IPv6 prefixes when employing 33 Mbits of BRAM and 4 channels of external SRAM. The prototype achieves a sustained throughput of 264 million IPv6 lookups per second, or 135 Gbps with minimum size (64-byte) packets."
982999,15237,8494,A many-core platform implemented for multi-channel seizure detection,2012,"This paper presents a reconfigurable many-core platform performing fixed point DSP applications supporting up to 64 cores routed in a hierarchical network. To demonstrate an application, electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure detection and analysis is mapped onto the cores. The individual cores are based on a 5 stage RISC pipeline architecture optimized to support communication to other cores on the platform. To reconfigure the platform, programs are loaded onto each of the cores. Communication between cores is implemented using low-area routers that partitions computational cores into hierarchical clusters resulting in a low network diameter. The routers use a packet-switched protocol that minimizes circuitry which further reduces circuit size in comparison to the computational circuitry. A globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) architecture is implemented to eliminate global clock routing which consumes high levels of power due to long propagation and thus high capacitive loading from many cores. Additionally, cores not configured for an application has its local clock disabled which turns off unused cores. The overall result is a platform with lower power consumption than a traditional single core DSP with the reconfigurability lacking in an ASIC. Applications tested within the mapping include the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. The seizure detection and analysis algorithm, when mapped onto the many-core platform, takes 5663 cycles to execute in 14.45 µs. The prototype SoC is implemented in 65 nm CMOS which contains 64 cores and occupies 8.41 mm 2 ."
1664286,15237,23593,A scalable approach for automated precision analysis,2012,"The freedom over the choice of numerical precision is one of the key factors that can only be exploited throughout the datapath of an FPGA accelerator, providing the ability to trade the accuracy of the final computational result with the silicon area, power, operating frequency, and latency. However, in order to tune the precision used throughout hardware accelerators automatically, a tool is required to verify that the hardware will meet an error or range specification for a given precision. Existing tools to perform this task typically suffer either from a lack of tightness of bounds or require a large execution time when applied to large scale algorithms; in this work, we propose an approach that can both scale to larger examples and obtain tighter bounds, within a smaller execution time, than the existing methods. The approach we describe also provides a user with the ability to trade the quality of bounds with execution time of the procedure, making it suitable within a word-length optimization framework for both small and large-scale algorithms.   We demonstrate the use of our approach on instances of iterative algorithms to solve a system of linear equations. We show that because our approach can track how the relative error decreases with increasing precision, unlike the existing methods, we can use it to create smaller hardware with guaranteed numerical properties. This results in a saving of 25% of the area in comparison to optimizing the precision using competing analytical techniques, whilst requiring a smaller execution time than the these methods, and saving almost 80% of area in comparison to adopting IEEE double precision arithmetic."

Advances in microfluidics technology offer exciting possibilities for high-throughput DNA sequencing, protein crystallization, drug discovery, immunoassays, neo-natal and point-of-care clinical diagnostics, etc. As microfluidic lab-on-chip mature into multifunctional devices with “smart” reconfiguration and adaptation capabilities, automated design and ease of use become extremely important.

1866653,15237,8500,An embedded DRAM technology for high-performance NAND flash memories,2011,"An embedded DRAM using a standard NAND flash memory process has been demonstrated for the first time. This embedded DRAM without extra costly manufacturing process realizes 2.4 mm 2  /Mb macro density and provides large-capacity on-chip page buffers and data caches for NAND flash memories to enhance their performances. A 32 KB DRAM buffer macro with 1.5 μm 2 cell has been fabricated with a 32 nm NAND flash memory process. Even with small 3 fF cell using a planar MOS capacitor, an enough ±100 mV cell signal has been obtained by introducing a technique to self-boost cell node up to 4 V using a merit of high-voltage NAND flash process, and two techniques to curtail parasitic bitline capacitance down to 60 fF at 128 wordlines per bitline. An undershoot problem of cell nodes due to unwanted plateline bounce is resolved by a two-step-rise/fall wordline scheme. Installation of dummy cell scheme to obtain a half of “1” data (not an average of “1” and “0” data) cuts out 32 KB macro size by 1.3% while suppressing mismatch to 3 mV at the grounded bitline precharge. The 32 KB test vehicle shows 90 ns random cycle time with 15 ns burst cycle time (66 Mb/s/pin). The measured characteristics of 2 × 10 -18  bit error rater (BER) by soft error and 10 ms data retention at 85 °C are enough for page buffer application in a NAND flash memory. The measured active current of 32 KB macro is 7 mA at 90 ns random cycle, but only 3.2 mA at practical use of 15 ns burst with 256B page access."
1335195,15237,9772,Schematic-driven physical verification: Fully automated solution for analog IC design,2012,"Designing ICs (integrated circuits) is inherently a complex task involving human expertise as well as aids intended to accelerate the process. A fundamental requirement for design success is a clear strategy that coordinates the entire design flow from specifications to a marketable product. Modem VLSI (very large scale integration) IC designs, especially analog/mixed signal LSIs, must meet various design and electrical constraints such as IR-drop, cross-talk, low power and low voltage design. This complexity poses several physical design challenges for specific analog structures such as device symmetry, net matching and more. Therefore it is essential to have some form of communication between the front-end designers (schematic and transistor level) and the physical layout engineers. The current process involves the front-end designer placing the design constraints in the form of annotations on the schematic netlist. These annotations are then passed to the layout team for manual implementation followed by visual verification only. This paper explores a new methodology providing a fully automated CAD flow that captures the designer's intent from the schematic netlist, links these annotations to the proper devices or nets on the physical layout level, then runs verification checks using the Calibre  R  tool suite. Several applications can be used with the proposed flow, in this work we will present an application specifically for capturing design constraints related to physical layout recommendations, tested on Opamp circuit."
2185489,15237,8500,A low-power integrated x86–64 and graphics processor for mobile computing devices,2011,"AMD's first Fusion Accelerated Processor Unit (APU) codenamed “Zacate” (Fig. 15.4.1) combines a pair of x86 CPUs cores codenamed “Bobcat”, 1MB L2 Cache, Client Northbridge (CNB), with a DirectX ®  11 Radeon™ HD5000 graphics/multimedia controller on a single die. The CNB provides an interface to a single 64b DDR3 memory channel, which can operate at up to DDR3–1066. The Fusion architecture implements an efficient form of unified memory architecture (UMA) where a portion of system memory is reserved as graphics frame buffer memory. The graphics memory controller (GMC) arbitrates between graphics, video and display memory accesses and presents a well-ordered stream of system memory requests through the CNB over dedicated 256b wide read and write busses. These GMC requests bypass all of the CNB coherency mechanisms allowing for fast direct access to memory and exposing most of the available memory bandwidth (8.53GB/s). Compared to two chip solutions, use of the on-die integrated GPU significantly reduces memory latency, improves request ordering, and reduces power. The APU supports display formats including VGA, LVDS, Display Port, DVI or HDMI™.

2197865,15237,8500,A 28.3 mW PA-Closed Loop for Linearity and Efficiency Improvement Integrated in a $+$ 27.1 dBm WCDMA CMOS Power Amplifier,2012,"A low-cost, fully integrated CMOS PA is attractive. The main challenge is to improve its power efficiency. Although many linearization and efficiency improvement techniques have been proposed, most of these techniques are based on feed-forward, which may not be effective under varying PVT and load conditions [1–3]. The bandwidth is the issue for feedback techniques such as Cartesian and polar loop. There is a severe trade-off between output power and bandwidth, since generating high output power requires many gain stages including mixers and multiple drivers, which results in a large group delay. To overcome the trade-off, we propose a PA-closed loop, where an integrated feedback directly controls the final stage of a watt-level CMOS PA, as shown in Fig. 4.6.1. Although stable feedback at RF is difficult, separate phase and amplitude feedback can be realized without the stability issue. Large bandwidth and high output power are simultaneously realized, as the loop contains only the PA in the signal path and it is composed of a small number of building blocks. In addition, the proposed architecture is desirable for system integration, as the PA does not require an off-chip linearizer. The feedback improves ACLR with WCDMA output by 6dB, where the output power and PAE are +27.1dBm and 28%, respectively. Thanks to the feedback nature, it can improve the linearity and efficiency with varying load conditions, and is suitable for the increasing isolator-less applications. The linear output power and PAE are improved by up to 2.3dB and 6%, respectively, while the circuits for the loop consume 28.3mW."
1155702,15237,9772,Microcells for ICA-SOC for remote sensing of high energy radiation,2014,"In ‘radiation remote sensing’ multiple unknown high energy sources are generally involved, and upon sensing the detectors must separate their contributions blindly for further analysis. That is, the objective is to recover the unobserved source signals from the observed mixtures without the knowledge of the mixing coefficients. An effective way to perform such separation is through Independent Component Analysis algorithm. This paper sets the background for this important application, shows successful application of the algorithm on actually measured multi-source data, develops an architecture for the ICA-SOC and, importantly, presents two major VLSI cells for it. A parallel architecture is presented utilizing two reconfigurable coarse-gain microcells with high functionality, performance, and reconfigurability. Fabricated in 0.5 micron CMOS process and tested, these comprise a two-cycle Universal Nonlinear (UNL) cell, and a two-cycle extended multiply accumulate (MA_PLUS) cell. The UNL includes two specialized functions for ICA, namely (1) the first derivative of an approximation to the negentropy function g(u) = G'(u) = u exp(-u2/2), and (2) the second derivative of the approximation to the negentropy function g′(u) = G″(u) = [1-u2]exp(-u2/2); The coarse-grain approach has the distinct advantages of reduced external interconnect, reduced design time, and manageable testability. The overall application goal is an intelligent sensor system for high energy radiation remote sensing, with integrated processing-and-decision-making capability, which can reliably separate threat radioactivity from the ambient one."
1729418,15237,23593,Combining computation and communication optimizations in system synthesis for streaming applications,2014,"Data streaming is a widely-used technique to exploit task-level parallelism in many application domains such as video processing, signal processing and wireless communication. In this paper we propose an efficient system-level synthesis flow to map streaming applications onto FPGAs with consideration of simultaneous computation and communication optimizations. The throughput of a streaming system is significantly impacted by not only the performance and number of replicas of the computation kernels, but also the buffer size allocated for the communications between kernels. In general, module selection/replication and buffer size optimization were addressed separately in previous work. Our approach combines these optimizations together in system scheduling which minimizes the area cost for both logic and memory under the required throughput constraint. We first propose an integer linear program (ILP) based solution to the combined problem which has the optimal quality of results. Then we propose an iterative algorithm which can achieve the near-optimal quality of results but has a significant improvement on the algorithm scalability for large and complex designs. The key contribution is that we have a polynomial-time algorithm for an exact schedulability checking problem and a polynomial-time algorithm to improve the system performance with better module implementation and buffer size optimization. Experimental results show that compared to the separate scheme of module select/replication and buffer size optimization, the combined optimization scheme can gain 62% area saving on average under the same performance requirements. Moreover, our heuristic can achieve 2 to 3 orders of magnitude of speed-up in runtime, with less than 10% area overhead compared to the optimal solution by ILP."
1808905,15237,23593,Non-adaptive sparse recovery and fault evasion using disjunct design configurations (abstract only),2014,"A run-time fault diagnosis and evasion scheme for reconfigurable devices is developed based on an explicit Non-adaptive Group Testing (NGT). NGT involves grouping disjunct subsets of reconfigurable resources into test pools, or samples. Each test pool realizes a Diagnostic Configuration (DC) performing functional testing during diagnosis procedure. The collective test outcomes after testing each diagnostic pool can be efficiently decoded to identify up to  d  defective logic resources. An algorithm for constructing NGT sampling procedure and resource placement during design time with optimal minimal number of test groups is derived through the well-known in statistical literature  d-disjunctness property . The combinatorial properties of resultant DCs also guarantee that any possible set of defective resources less than or equal to  d  are not utilized by at least one DC, allowing a low-overhead fault resolution. It also provides the ability to assess the resources state of failure. The proposed testing scheme thus avoids time-intensive run-time diagnosis imposed by previously proposed adaptive group testing for reconfigurable hardware without compromising diagnostic coverage. In addition, proposed NGT scheme can be combined with other fault tolerance approaches to ameliorate their fault recovery strategies. Experimental results for a set of MCNC benchmarks using Xilinx ISE Design Suite on a Virtex-5 FPGA have demonstrated  d -diagnosability at slice level with average accuracy of 99.15% and 97.76% for  d =1 and  d =2, respectively."
867497,15237,8500,Power-efficient readout circuit for miniaturized electronic nose,2012,"A hybrid combination of piezoelectric MEMS resonators and CMOS oscillator readout circuit forms the necessary ingredients of a new generation of electronic nose (e-nose) devices that, owing to their form factor and power consumption, enable a range of novel applications. Using “application specific” polymer coatings, the individual resonators can be tuned to detect mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with a broad range of applications such as: personalized health and environmental air quality measurements leading to more energy efficient sustainable buildings. Main research directions in VOC detection system include high-power thermo-mechanically actuated sensors and low-noise differential readouts [1] or Pierce-based oscillators of [2] suited for low motional sensor impedance. This paper presents a hybrid low-power, high-resolution e-nose system, including the necessary digital interface. An integrated readout was designed for the tracking of resonant frequency shift due to a change in the VOC environment concentration. It interfaces a piezo-actuated functionalized doubly clamped beam resonator that combines low actuation power (μW), high VOC sensitivity but low quality factor in air, large parasitic capacitance and multiple resonance modes.

1822143,15237,8335,On the design and analysis of fault tolerant NoC architecture using spare routers,2011,"The aggressive advent in VLSI manufacturing technology has made dramatic impacts on the dependability of devices and interconnects. In the modern manycore system, mesh based Networks-on-Chip (NoC) is widely adopted as on chip communication infrastructure. It is critical to provide an effective fault tolerance scheme on mesh based NoC. A faulty router or broken link isolates a well functional processing element (PE). Also, a set of faulty routers form faulty regions which may break down the whole design. To address these issues, we propose an innovative router-level fault tolerance scheme with spare routers which is different from the traditional microarchitecture-level approach. The spare routers not only provide redundancies but also diversify connection paths between adjacent routers. To exploit these valuable resources on fault tolerant capabilities, two configuration algorithms are demonstrated. One is shift-and-replace-allocation (SARA) and the other is defect-awareness-path-allocation (DAPA) that takes advantage of path diversity in our architecture. The proposed design is transparent to any routing algorithm since the output topology is consistent to the original mesh. Experimental results show that our scheme has remarkable improvements on fault tolerant metrics including reliability, mean time to failure (MTTF), and yield. In addition, the performance of spare router increases with the growth of NoC size but the relative connection cost decreases at the same time. This rare and valuable characteristic makes our solution suitable for large scale NoC design."
1980137,15237,8500,95%-lower-BER 43%-lower-power intelligent solid-state drive (SSD) with asymmetric coding and stripe pattern elimination algorithm,2011,"This paper presents intelligent solid-state drives (SSDs), which decrease memory errors by 95% and reduce power consumption by 43%. Figure 11.4.1 shows the measured memory cell error in the data retention and program disturb of 4X, 3X and 2Xnm NAND flash memories. As the memory size decreases, both data retention and program disturb errors increase due to the interference, random telegraph noise and reduced electrons [1]. In the scaled NAND, the electric field in the channel increases [2] and the program disturb due to GIDL-induced hot electron injection becomes more significant (Fig. 11.4.1(c)). In conventional SSDs, 20 to 40b correction per 1KB codeword error-correcting code (ECC) is used to correct errors [3]. As stronger codes, such as LDPC, are developed [4], the capability of ECC is close to the Shannon limit of a few percent error correction. Thus, the additional high-reliability scheme is required. As the feature size decreases, the power consumption increases due to the increased bit-line capacitance of NAND [5]. As the space between bitlines decreases, the inter bitline capacitance increases. To overcome reliability and power problems in SSDs, this paper describes two technologies. Asymmetric coding improves memory-cell reliability by 95% without access-time penalty. Stripe pattern elimination algorithm eliminates the worst program data pattern and decreases the power during the program by 43% without circuit area or access time overhead."
732194,15237,23593,A scalable routability-driven analytical placer with global router integration for FPGAs (abstract only),2014,"As the sizes of modern circuits become bigger and bigger, implementing those large circuits into FPGA becomes arduous. The state-of-the-art academic FPGA place-and-route tool, VPR, has good quality but needs around a whole day to complete a placement when the input circuit contains millions of lookup tables, excluding the runtime for routing. To expedite the placement process, we propose a routability-driven placement algorithm for FPGA that adopts techniques used in ASIC global placer. Our placer follows the lower-bound-and-upper-bound iterative optimization process in ASIC placers like  Ripple . In the lower-bound computation, the total HPWL, modeled using the Bound2Bound net model, is minimized using the conjugate gradient method. In the upper-bound computation, an almost-legalized result is produced by spreading cells linearly in the placement area. Those positions are then served as fixed-point anchors and fed into the next lower-bound computation. Furthermore, global routing will be performed in the upper-bound computation to estimate the routing segment usage, as a mean to consider congestion in placement. We tested our approach using 20 MCNC benchmarks and 4 large benchmarks for performance and scalability. Experimental results show that based on the island-style architecture which VPR is most optimized for, our approach can obtain a placement result 8x faster than VPR with 2% more in channel width, or 3x faster with 1% more in channel width when congestion is being considered. Our approach is even 14x faster than VPR in placing large benchmarks with over 10,000 lookup tables, with only 7% more in channel width."
715791,15237,8500,A 10mW 37.8GHz current-redistribution BiCMOS VCO with an average FOMT of −193.5dBc/Hz,2013,"The continued scaling of digital CMOS technology has enabled mm-Wave VCOs with record figures of merit [1-5]. This is mainly driven by the increase in cutoff frequency and decrease in power consumption brought by lower supply voltages. However, at mm-Wave, challenges such as low Q-factor of the tuning varactors and switched capacitors result in a sharp degradation in the resonator Q. For an NMOS LC-VCO (Fig. 8.8.1), a large bias current and high transconductance (g m ) are needed to maintain a given oscillation amplitude and to satisfy the startup condition. Since g m  has a weak dependency on current in strong inversion, it can primarily be increased by enlarging the device width, W 1 , as illustrated in Fig. 8.8.2. Further degradation in the device g m  is experienced when the VCO operates near the transistor cutoff frequency, necessitating an even larger W 1  (Fig. 8.8.2). This results in a large fixed capacitance C fix1  and hence a limited VCO tuning range (TR) [1,2]. It can also be shown that for the same bias current (i.e. output swing), increasing W1 comes at the expense of large thermal (1/f 2 ) noise. This can be illustrated by examining the excess noise factor F, defined as the ratio between the transistors' switching noise and the tank resistor noise [6]. As depicted in Fig. 8.8.2, an extra 5dB of 1/f 2  noise is added to the VCO output when the transistor W1 is increased from 20μm to 60μm, which is required to meet a 2× startup margin. Moreover, increasing W 1  leads to a higher contribution of 1/f 3  noise from up-converted 1/f noise [7]."
807346,15237,8500,A 10Gb/s burst-mode TIA with on-chip reset/lock CM signaling detection and limiting amplifier with a 75ns settling time,2012,"Emerging symmetric 10Gb/s passive optical network (PON) systems aim at high network transmission efficiency by reducing the RX settling time that is needed for RX amplitude recovery in burst-mode (BM). A conventional AC-coupled BM-RX has an inherent tradeoff between short settling time and decision threshold droop, which makes an RX settling time shorter than 400ns hard to achieve [1]. Some techniques have been developed to overcome this limitation [1–2], demonstrating a settling time of 150 to 200ns. Our previous work [3] uses feed-forward automatic offset compensation (AOC) to achieve a response time as short as 25.6ns. However, a feed-forward scheme using peak detectors is intrinsically less accurate and results in relatively high power consumption. In this paper, we present a DC-coupled 10Gb/s BM-TIA and burst-mode limiting amplifier (BM-LA) chipset that uses a feedback type AOC circuit with switchable loop BW. This new technique is capable of removing input DC offset in less than 75ns, and offers continuous decision threshold tracking during payload, to cope with the maximum length of CID. The differential TIA output port senses a CM reset signal provided by the succeeding BM-LA, and activates an on-chip reset and lock function. This BM-LA also integrates auto reset/activity generation circuits providing the AOC BW switching signal, so that this time-critical signal is not required from the PON system."
1336096,15237,23593,An FPGA implementation of a sparse quadratic programming solver for constrained predictive control,2011,"Model predictive control (MPC) is an advanced industrial control technique that relies on the solution of a quadratic programming (QP) problem at every sampling instant to determine the input action required to control the current and future behaviour of a physical system. Its ability in handling large multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with physical constraints has led to very successful applications in slow processes, where there is sufficient time for solving the optimization problem between sampling instants. The application of MPC to faster systems, which adds the requirement of greater sampling frequencies, relies on new ways of finding faster solutions to QP problems. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are specially well suited for this application due to the large amount of computation for a small amount of I/O. In addition, unlike a software implementation, an FPGA can provide the precise timing guarantees required for interfacing the controller to the physical system. We present a high-throughput floating-point FPGA implementation that exploits the parallelism inherent in interior-point optimization methods. It is shown that by considering that the QPs come from a control formulation, it is possible to make heavy use of the sparsity in the problem to save computations and reduce memory requirements by 75%. The implementation yields a 6.5x improvement in latency and a 51x improvement in throughput for large problems over a software implementation running on a general purpose microprocessor."
2554482,15237,8500,A highly parallel and scalable CABAC decoder for next generation video coding,2011,"Future video decoders will need to support high resolutions such as Quad Full HD (QFHD, 4096 × 2160) and fast frame rates (e.g., 120 fps). Many of these decoders will also reside in portable devices. Parallel processing can be used to increase the throughput for higher performance (i.e., processing speed), which can be traded-off for lower power with voltage scaling. The next generation standard called High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), which is being developed as a successor to H.264/AVC, not only seeks to improve the coding efficiency but also to account for implementation complexity and leverage parallelism to meet future power and performance demands. This paper presents a silicon prototype for a pre-standard algorithm developed for HEVC (“H.265”) called Massively Parallel CABAC (MP-CABAC) that addresses a key video decoder bottleneck. A scalable test chip is implemented in 65-nm and achieves a throughput of 24.11 bins/cycle, which enables it to decode the max H.264/AVC bit-rate (300 Mb/s) with only a 18 MHz clock at 0.7 V, while consuming 12.3 pJ/bin. At 1.0 V, it decodes a peak of 3026 Mbins/s for a bit-rate of 2.3 Gb/s, enough for QFHD at 186 fps. Both architecture and joint algorithm-architecture optimizations used to reduce critical path delay, area cost and memory size are discussed."
1024932,15237,20649,Application of logic synthesis to the understanding and cure of genetic diseases,2012,"In the quest to understand and cure genetic diseases such as cancer, the fundamental approach being taken is undergoing a gradual change. It is becoming more acceptable to view these diseases as an engineering problem, and systems engineering approaches are becoming more accepted as a means to tackle genetic diseases. In this light, we believe that logic synthesis techniques can play a very important role. Several techniques from the field of logic synthesis can be adapted to assist in the arguably huge effort of modeling and controlling such diseases. The set of genes that control a particular genetic disease can be modeled as a Finite State Machine (FSM) called the Gene Regulatory Network (GRN). Important problems include (i) inferring the GRN from observed gene expression data from patients and (ii) assuming that such a GRN exists, determining the best set of drugs so that the disease is maximally cured. In this paper, we report initial results on the application of logic synthesis techniques that we have developed to address both these problems. In the first technique, we present Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) based approaches to infer the logical support of each gene that regulates melanoma, using gene expression data from patients of the disease. From the output of such a tool, biologists can construct targeted experiments to understand the logic functions that regulate a particular gene. The second technique assumes that the GRN is known, and uses a weighted partial Max-SAT formulation to find the set of drugs with the least side-effects, that steer the GRN state towards one that is closest to that of a healthy individual, in the context of colon cancer. Our group is currently exploring the application of several other logic techniques to a variety of related problems in this domain."

While these technology features are extremely compelling, they considerably stress the existing design practices and EDA tool flows typically conceived for 2D systems. With all system, technology and implementation level options brought with these features, the design space increases to an extent where traditional 2D tools cannot be used any more for efficient exploration. Therefore, the cost-effective design of future 3D ICs products will require new planning and co-optimisation techniques and tools that are fast and accurate enough to cope with these challenges. In this paper we present design methodology and the practical EDA tool chain that covers different aspects of the design flow and is specific to efficient design of 3D-ICs. Flow features include: fast synthesis and 3D design partitioning at gate level, TSV/micro-bump array planning, 3D floor planning, placement and routing, congestion analysis, fast thermal and mechanical modeling, easy technology vs. implementation trade-off analysis, 3D device models generations and Design-for-Test (DfT). The application of the tool chain is illustrated using concrete example of a real-world design, showing not only the applicability of the tool chain, but also the benefits of heterogeneous 2.5 and 3D integration technologies."

Current CAD tools for FPGA power estimation either support specific hardware provided by vendors or contain power models for mainly conventional FPGA architectures. However, with technology advancement, versatile novel FPGA architectures are being proposed to further augment current FPGA architecture at various aspects, such as emerging FPGA based on non-volatile memory, improved logic and DSP design, etc. In order to evaluate the power consumption of versatile FPGA designs, the power estimator has to be made more flexible and extendable to support new devices and architectures. In this work, we proposed such a tool that the power estimation can be performed based on a hierarchical library which contains power models at different levels, such as circuit components or devices. The tool can collect resource utilization of FPGA for the implemented circuit, and then perform power estimation at coarse-grain or fine-grain levels based on the hierarchical library to achieve the desired complexity-accuracy trade-off. The flexibility is provided that users can customize the hierarchical library for new circuit components or devices with power number of their own study.   In this work, benchmarks evaluation results are verified against commercial power estimation tool to show the accuracy of the proposed tool. Case study on RRAM FPGA is also presented to demonstrate the tool's flexibility to support emerging technology and novel design."
756232,15237,8500,A fully intraocular 0.0169mm 2 /pixel 512-channel self-calibrating epiretinal prosthesis in 65nm CMOS,2013,"Since their conception and success in human trials, the flexibility and spatial resolution of retinal prostheses have been of major interest. Clinical studies have revealed that hundreds of channels are needed to restore functional visual perception, and more sophisticated waveforms present advantages over biphasic pulses. Initial designs targeted stimulation current levels up to 1mA to ensure functionality. For such designs, an output compliance of >10V was required, and HV technologies were used at the expense of area and power consumption. Human clinical trials have recently shown that implanted electrodes present a stimulus threshold as low as 50μA. In addition, advances in implant technology promise close placement of electrode array and retinal tissue, which can further decrease the required current. Thus, highly scaled LV technologies can provide alternative means to reduce area and power, and to support hundreds of flexible independent channels for fully intraocular implants. In this paper, a self-calibrating 512-channel epiretinal prosthesis in 65nm CMOS is presented. It features dual-band telemetry for power and data, clock recovery, a 2-step calibration technique to match biphasic stimulation currents, and an independent arbitrary output waveform per channel. The implant integrates coils (power and data), IC, external capacitors and electrode array using a biocompatible parylene substrate, providing a fully intraocular solution."
1755157,15237,8500,A 40nm CMOS all-digital fractional-N synthesizer without requiring calibration,2012,"Bang-Bang all-digital PLLs [1] for applications such as digital clock multiplication have existed for a long time, but show limited phase noise performance. Pioneering recent work [2–5] has demonstrated frequency synthesizers that meet the performance requirements of wireless communications systems, while containing no analog circuits except for an LC-oscillator. In order to build an All-Digital Phase-Locked Loop (ADPLL), it is necessary to measure the oscillator's momentary phase accurately, in a digital way, since the output phase noise at frequencies within the PLL loop bandwidth is ultimately limited by the time quantisation step Δt of this phase measurement [6]: L=20.log 10  (Δt·ω osc /√12·√f sample ) [dBc/Hz] (1) In [2–5], a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) is used to measure the oscillator's phase with a resolution of a single inverter delay. However, this approach requires calibration of the TDC conversion gain. Previous work [2] included a small microprocessor incorporated in the PLL circuit, to perform all necessary calculations related to the calibration. Obviously, this renders the circuit complex, is prone to calibration errors and consumes power and area. In this paper, an alternative approach is presented, allowing all-digital frequency synthesizers that meet the requirements for wireless communications standards, that benefit from the benign scaling properties, porting properties, process independence and controlled design flow, inherent to digital circuits, but that, on the other hand, do not require the burden of calibration and associated calculations."
1924322,15237,8500,"A 72 dB DR, CT ΔΣ Modulator Using Digitally Estimated, Auxiliary DAC Linearization Achieving 88 fJ/conv-step in a 25 MHz BW",2012,"This paper presents a single loop, third order continuous time ΔΣ modulator with an internal 4 bit quantizer sampled at 500 MHz with only an oversampling ratio of 10. Since multi-bit operation commonly suffers from DAC non-linearities, and dynamic element matching is ineffective at low oversampling, an alternative auxiliary DAC linearization is proposed for ΔΣ modulators. The unit element mismatches are digitally estimated based on a cross correlation of a binary test signal with the modulator output and represent the measured DNL of DAC1. The corresponding INL is calculated and stored in an 15×8 lookup-table which is applied to the 8 bit auxiliary DAC to linearize DAC1. Moreover, a design centering approach for amplifier finite gain bandwidth compensation within the loop filter is presented which allows for large bandwidth mismatch with negligible effect on loop filter stability. This results in a robust architecture over temperature, supply, and excess loop delay variations. The presented ΔΣ modulator achieves an SNDR of 67.5 dB, DR of 72 dB, and SFDR of 79 dB over a 25 MHz bandwidth and is implemented in a 1.2 V, 90 nm CMOS process. The modulator occupies an active area of 0.19 mm 2  and has a power consumption of 8.5 mW. It achieves a figure of merit of 88 fJ/conv-step which is one of the best published for multi-bit ΔΣ modulators."
1223378,15237,8500,A super-regenerative radio on plastic based on thin-film transistors and antennas on large flexible sheets for distributed communication links,2013,"Large-area electronics presents new form factors, enabling ubiquitous systems that are flexible and capable of scaling to very large areas. By processing thin-film transistors (TFTs) at low temperatures on plastic (using organics, amorphous silicon, metal oxides, etc.), blocks such as ADCs, amplifiers, and processors can be realized [1,2]; however, aside from short-range RFID tags [3], wireless links for long-range communication have not been achieved. A key challenge is that wireless systems typically depend on the ability to generate and operate at high frequencies, yet TFTs are limited to very low performance (f t  ~1MHz). Specifically, the challenge is low device g m , due to low mobility and limited gate-dielectric scalability, as well as high device capacitance, due to limited feature scalability and large overlaps for alignment margining on flexible substrates. This work presents a super-regenerative (SR) transceiver with integrated antenna on plastic that leverages the attribute of large area to create highquality passives; this enables resonant TFT circuits at high frequencies (near f t ) and allows for large antennas, maximizing the communication distance. The resulting carrier frequency is 900kHz, and the range is over 12m (at 2kb/s). As shown in Fig. 25.10.1, this will enable sheets with integrated arrays of radio frontends for distributing a large number of communication links over large areas."
719986,15237,23593,FPGA-RR: an enhanced FPGA architecture with RRAM-based reconfigurable interconnects (abstract only),2012,"In this study, we explore the use of Resistive RAMs (RRAMs) as candidates for programmable interconnects in FPGAs. An RRAM cell can be programmed between high resistance state and low resistance state, with an on/off ratio close to MOSFET. It provides an opportunity to use an RRAM as a routing switch at a much smaller area cost than its CMOS counterpart. RRAMs can be fabricated over CMOS circuits using CMOS-compatible processes to have a more compact gate array. Our recent work (presented in NanoArch'2011) demonstrated significant potential of area, delay, and power reduction from using RRAMs in FPGAs. But some design problems remain open. The programming of RRAM switches integrated in interconnects is one important problem. We show that the high-level architecture of programming circuits for RRAM switches should be modified to avoid potential logic hazard. Also the programming cells used in previous works have an area overhead even larger than RRAM itself. We manage to reduce this overhead significantly with utilization of the non-arbitrary pattern of RRAM integration in FPGA interconnects. In addition we suggest a novel buffering solution for FPGA interconnects in light of the low area cost of RRAM-based routing switch. We propose on-demand buffer insertion, where buffers can be connected to interconnects via RRAMs to dynamically reflect the demand of the netlist to map onto FPGA. Compared to conventional buffering solution which are pre-determined during fabrication and can only be optimized for general case, our solution shows further area savings and performance improvement. The resulting FPGA architecture using RRAM for programmable interconnects is named FPGA-RR. We provide a complete CAD flow for FPGA-RR."
2268651,15237,23907,Ultra low-FOM high-precision ΔΣ modulators with fully-clocked SO and zero static power quantizers,2011,"In this paper, two high-precision switched-opamp (SO) based ΔΣ modulators with ultra low figure-of-merit (FOM) are introduced respectively for bio-medical and audio applications. To save 50% power, both modulators adopt novel fully-clocked current mirror SOs with new bias circuits especially designed for SO. Besides, several measures are proposed separately in two modulators to ensure high performances. Both circuitries are implemented in 0.18µm CMOS. The modulator-I, for bio-medical applications, employs high density MOSCAPs to reduce chip area. Also, an innovative zero static power quantizer using MOSCAP-strings is developed to save up to 96% power and 69% area than traditional structure. With only 13µW power consumption at 1.0V supply voltage, it achieves 85dB peak-SNDR, 44.7fJ/conv.-step FOM for 10 kHz bandwidth. In the modulator-II, for audio applications, a novel 17-level scheme consisting of only nine comparators and two capacitor-strings is introduced to remove static power completely and save 40% chip area over the traditional quantizer. In addition, a dual cycle shift (DCS) DWA technique is introduced here to suppress in-band tone effectively. The modulator-II achieves 92dB peak-SNDR and 35.6fJ/conv.-step FOM with only 58µW power consumption at 0.9V supply voltage."
2311067,15237,8500,A 28fJ/conv-step CT ΔΣ modulator with 78dB DR and 18MHz BW in 28nm CMOS using a highly digital multibit quantizer,2013,"Recently reported continuous-time (CT) ΔΣ modulators with opamp bandwidth compensation and high-order single-opamp integrators have achieved FoM values well below 100fJ/conv-step [1-3]. With loop-filter power greatly reduced, power dissipation in multibit quantizers becomes especially significant. For example, the quantizer in [2] accounts for 2.8mW of 8.5mW total power dissipation. Also, the input capacitance of multibit quantizers and the output parasitics of excess loop delay (ELD) compensation DACs result in increased power demand for summing circuits. To minimize power dissipation, two recent works use 1b quantizers with FIR DACs and replace ELD compensation DACs with a DAC followed by analog filter [3] or with feedback to the pre-amplifier [4]. ELD compensation may also be realized using digital logic following the quantizer [5]. This paper presents a low-power solution based on a highly digital multibit quantizer with embedded feedback to compensate for finite opamp bandwidth along with ELD. The quantizer consumes less than 10% of the total power and simplifies the analog circuits into a single DAC plus a feedforward loop filter with relaxed opamp requirements. Digital correction at the modulator output suggested by early work [6] is employed to shape DAC mismatch with the inherent noise transfer function (NTF) and to further relax circuit constraints. These digitally assisted techniques enable a CT ΔΣ modulator to achieve an FoM below 28fJ/conv-step."
1808383,15237,23593,Big data genome sequencing on Zynq based clusters (abstract only),2014,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) problems have attracted many attentions of researchers in biological and medical computing domains. The current state-of-the-art NGS computing machines are dramatically lowering the cost and increasing the throughput of DNA sequencing. In this paper, we propose a practical study that uses Xilinx Zynq board to summarize acceleration engines using FPGA accelerators and ARM processors for the state-of-the-art short read mapping approaches. The heterogeneous processors and accelerators are coupled with each other using a general Hadoop distributed processing framework. First the reads are collected by the central server, and then distributed to multiple accelerators on the Zynq for hardware acceleration. Therefore, the combination of hardware acceleration and Map-Reduce execution flow could greatly accelerate the task of aligning short length reads to a known reference genome. Our approach is based on preprocessing the reference genomes and iterative jobs for aligning the continuous incoming reads. The hardware acceleration is based on the creditable read-mapping algorithm RMAP software approach. Furthermore, the speedup analysis on a Hadoop cluster, which concludes 8 development boards, is evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed architecture and methods has the speedup of more than 112X, and is scalable with the number of accelerators. Finally, the Zynq based cluster has efficient potential to accelerate even general large scale big data applications.

1232155,15237,23907,A 1mJ/frame unified media application processor with a 179.7pJ mixed-mode feature extraction engine for embedded 3D-media contents processing,2012,"A unified media application processor (UMAP) with a low-power mixed-mode feature extraction engine (FEE) is presented for 2D/3D image analysis/synthesis applications on handheld devices. UMAP supports not only graphics and vision for augmented reality (AR) but also 3D reconstruction and 3D display for 3D-view AR based on heterogeneous many-core platform. A frame-level 3-stage pipelined architecture enables real-time (50fps in VGA) performance in 3D-view AR, while a mixed-mode FEE dynamically saves active power by reconfiguring operation modes between analog and digital processing. Especially for low power operation in media processing, four pairs of analog current contention logics (CCL) are implemented in FEE. The implemented CCL does not require digital-to-analog or analog-to-digital converters (DAC/ADC) in interfacing digital and analog domains. It includes a diode-connected sensing stabilizer which reduces minimum sensing current. Therefore, average power consumed in CCL is reduced by 44.9%. In the implemented UMAP, the proposed FEE replaces the parallel processing core cluster in the analog processing mode, as a result, 96.5% of cluster power and 99.1% of target detection time are saved. The dynamic mode transition between analog and digital processing based on run-time tracking of region-of-interest (ROI) reduces system energy dissipation by up to 84.2% compared to the state-of-the-art embedded media processors."

Serial signal-processing architectures, in which signal-processing circuits such as a programmable-gain amplifier (PGA) and an ADC can be shared by column-level correlated double sampling (CDS) circuits, promise to reduce chip size and power consumption. However, conventional column CDS circuits composed of linear capacitors or NMOS capacitors (NMOSCAPs) with output buffers (OBUFs) still occupy a large footprint. In this work, to reduce the area and the power consumption of column CDS circuits while keeping high linearity, 1.5V PMOS capacitors (PMOSCAPs) are employed. These capacitors work as low-cost sample-and-hold (S/H) capacitors as well as voltage level-shifters by using body-terminal control. To reduce the power consumption of the ADC, instead of a conventional pipeline ADC, we propose a 10b self-differential offset-cancelled pipeline SAR-ADC. It operates with the reference voltage of the ADC's half full-scale voltage (V fs ), leading to a reduction of 80% switching power and 50% capacitor DAC (CDAC) area in the ADC. A black-level correction function is built in the ADC without any additional DACs. The proof-of-concept circuits are implemented in a 1.4Mpixel CMOS image sensor that consumes 51.0mW with a frame rate of 17fps and a read noise of 187.5μV rms  at 8.1× analog gain."
1696787,15237,20649,DAE2FSM: automatic generation of accurate discrete-time logical abstractions for continuous-time circuit dynamics,2012,"We abstract the I/O functionality of continuous-time dynamical systems (e.g., SPICE netlists with combinational and sequential logic) as Finite State Machines (FSMs). This enables efficient simulation of large designs implemented with less-than-perfect devices and components, and also opens the door to formal verification of transistor-level designs against higher-level specifications. In particular, our automatically generated FSMs faithfully capture the behaviour of latches, flip-flops, and circuits constructed from them. Among other technical advances, we generalize an existing (binary-only) FSM-learning approach to arbitrary I/O alphabets, which empowers it to learn high-fidelity abstractions of multi-level-discretized, multi-input/multi-output systems. Our approach, when applied to correctly functioning latches and flip-flops, is able to learn compact, multi-input FSM abstractions whose predictions closely match SPICE simulations. In addition, we have also applied our technique to produce multi-level-discretized FSM representations of digital systems that nevertheless exhibit analogish traits, such as an over-clocked, error-prone D-flip-flop. For such circuits, the automatically learned FSM abstraction includes additional states that characterise failure modes of the circuit for specific input sequences (these failure modes are also confirmed by SPICE simulations). Finally, we demonstrate that our technique is also applicable to larger and more complex multi-input, multi-output systems; for example, we are able to automatically derive an accurate FSM abstraction of a 280-transistor (BSIM4), 0-to-5 increment/decrement counter."
1678227,15237,8500,A soft self-commutating method using minimum control circuitry for multiple-string LED drivers,2013,"Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are widely used in general lightings due to their several advantages including high efficiency, high reliability, long life, and environmental friendliness. Recently, various converter-free methods for non-isolated LED drivers with multiple LED strings connected in series have been introduced, enabling both a higher efficiency and power factor (PF) as well as lower total harmonic distortion (THD) [1-3]. In multiple-string LED drivers, the efficiency and PF are enhanced as the number of LED strings increases because of a low overhead voltage. However, as the operational voltage range decreases, it is difficult to find a proper commutation time using input voltage sensing approaches due to input voltage noise and LED voltage variation [4]. Other concerns are EMI and EMC noise caused by high di/dt and dv/dt in hard commutations. When the LED current is high, negative effects of hard commutation become worse and the required di/dt control circuits are more complicated [5]. To meet EMI and EMC regulations for lightings without adding on-board EMI filters, soft commutation is essential. In order to overcome these problems, we propose a soft self-commutating method using a Source-Coupled Pair (SCP) and reference voltages. The conventional control circuits required for an appropriate commutation time and soft commutation are no longer necessary. The fabricated 6-string LED driver IC is capable of achieving high efficiency (92.2%), high PF (0.996) and low THD (8.6%) under the 22W/110V AC condition."
1240513,15237,8500,A source-synchronous 90Gb/s capacitively driven serial on-chip link over 6mm in 65nm CMOS,2012,"While continued scaling of feature sizes allows for an ever increasing number of cores in modern MPSoCs, power reduction and meeting on-chip bandwidth requirements are pressing concerns. Energy efficiency can be increased by per-core dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and by employing a globally-asynchronous, locally-synchronous (GALS) system architecture in which distribution of a synchronous high-speed clock is not required. For global on-chip communication this presents major challenges due to the need for reliable data synchronization, high bandwidth requirements and speed limiting RC effects on long wires. It has been shown recently that low-swing differential on-chip links provide highest bandwidth, low energy-per-bit and uninterrupted transfers over lengths up to 10mm [1–3, 6]. Capacitively-driven links are promising because of their built-in pre-emphasis thereby countervailing the low-pass behavior of long on-chip wires [1, 4–5]. However, all of these existing implementations focus mainly on the transmission line itself. The capacitively-driven links are not able to forward a stoppable clock signal as there is no well defined differential DC level on the wires with no data or clock activity. In addition, clocking is not reported [5] or fully synchronous, which means a high-speed clock must be distributed globally on-chip. This work provides a solution for capacitively-driven links with a parallel DC resistive divider to allow forwarded clocking with complete gating capability."

Higher floating-point precisions offer improved accuracy at the expense of performance and energy efficiency, with variable-precision floating-point circuits providing run-time precision selection [3]. Real-time certainty tracking enables variable-precision circuits not only to operate at the higher energy efficiency of low-precision datapaths, but also to preserve high-precision accuracy.

This includes kernel scheduler, inter-task communication and synchronization (i.e. mutex, semaphore, mailbox), timer and IRQ handler. The application software interfaces with SEOS through a set of standard Application Programming Interface (API). Furthermore, SEOS is also equipped with Generic Bus Interface and Interconnect Bridge to enable effortless OS porting across different processor platforms. These innovative approaches have made SEOS to be plug-and-play in nature. Our test result shows that SEOS is having performance improvement over commercial software based RTOS, µC/OS-II, in several areas. SEOS consumes 31.6% less overhead in context switching, improves task level interrupt latency by 83.5%, shorten inter-task communication latency by 71.9% and significantly improves on performance jitter."
1460402,15237,8500,Optical receivers using DFE-IIR equalization,2013,"Future computing systems will require increasingly high bandwidth to supply data to microprocessors, FPGAs, and other computational blocks [1,2]. Increasing data rate is a common solution, as I/O pad density is not scaling with bandwidth requirements. Copper interconnect has increasingly high loss with frequency, requiring complex, power-hungry equalization to overcome the channel response at high data rates. In contrast, optical interconnect can transport signals over long distances without complex equalization. Chip-to-chip optical interconnect will require sensitive, low-power, clocked receiver (RX) circuits that operate at high data rates. Conventional TIA-based RXs [1,2] require high power to maximize gain and minimize noise while maintaining high BW. A low-noise, low-BW, low-power TIA is combined with a 2-tap DFE to achieve high sensitivity in [3], but the data rate is 4Gb/s and limited dynamic range is demonstrated. Double-sampling architectures eliminate the TIA, replacing it with a large resistor [4] or a capacitive integrator [5], which decreases the front-end BW. The BW is equalized by double sampling, which is equivalent to a 2-tap FFE. However, the use of small sampling capacitors in [4,5] adds kT/C noise, limiting sensitivity. In this work, we demonstrate an optical RX with a large input resistance to maximize gain and sensitivity, while DFE with IIR feedback (DFE-IIR) [6] eliminates the resulting ISI with minimal added noise."
2405500,15237,23907,A digital neurosynaptic core using embedded crossbar memory with 45pJ per spike in 45nm,2011,"The grand challenge of neuromorphic computation is to develop a flexible brain-like architecture capable of a wide array of real-time applications, while striving towards the ultra-low power consumption and compact size of the human brain—within the constraints of existing silicon and post-silicon technologies. To this end, we fabricated a key building block of a modular neuromorphic architecture, a neurosynaptic core, with 256 digital integrate-and-fire neurons and a 1024×256 bit SRAM crossbar memory for synapses using IBM's 45nm SOI process. Our fully digital implementation is able to leverage favorable CMOS scaling trends, while ensuring one-to-one correspondence between hardware and software. In contrast to a conventional von Neumann architecture, our core tightly integrates computation (neurons) alongside memory (synapses), which allows us to implement efficient fan-out (communication) in a naturally parallel and event-driven manner, leading to ultra-low active power consumption of 45pJ/spike. The core is fully configurable in terms of neuron parameters, axon types, and synapse states and is thus amenable to a wide range of applications. As an example, we trained a restricted Boltzmann machine offline to perform a visual digit recognition task, and mapped the learned weights to our chip."
859082,15237,23593,"Design, implementation and security analysis of hardware trojan threats in FPGA (abstract only)",2014,"Hardware Trojan Threats (HTTs) are stealthy components embedded inside integrated circuits (ICs) with an intention to attack and cripple the IC similar to viruses infecting the human body. HTTs are easily introduced into the IC using untrusted tools and unauthenticated intellectual property (IP). Previous efforts have focused essentially on systems being compromised using HTTs and the effectiveness of physical parameters including power consumption, timing variation and utilization for detecting HTTs. Less attention has been devoted to the monitoring of the system to analyze the HTT infection using a combination of affected physical parameters. We propose a novel metric for hardware Trojan detection, termed as HTT detectability metric (HDM) that leverages a weighted combination of normalized physical parameters. As opposed to existing studies, this work investigates a system model from a designer perspective in increasing the security of the device and an adversary model from an attacker perspective exposing and exploiting the vulnerabilities in the device. Based on the models, seven malicious HTTs were designed and implemented on a FPGA testbed to perform a variety of threats ranging from sensitive information leak, denial of service to beat the Root of Trust (RoT). Security analysis on the implemented Trojans clearly showed that existing detection techniques based on physical characteristics such as power consumption, timing variation or utilization does not necessarily capture the existence of HTTs as HTTs can be optimally designed and placed into the hardware that masks within these parameters. Our results showed that using HDM, 86% of the implemented Trojans were detected as opposed to using power, timing and utilization alone."
1410470,15237,8494,Hybrid processor population for odor processing,2012,"Some computationally complex problems require complex solutions in terms of number of processors and diversity of computation methods. Metabolic systems are naturally capable of solving complex problems; they are mathematically modelled with hundreds of differential equations. In order to understand those metabolisms or simply replicate their functions in engineering problems, we need a large network of processors that is designed to mimic biological systems. Moreover, many processes take place in metabolic networks are results of collaboration of different types of cells that are randomly located. Therefore, bio-inspired topologically random mega-core networks of hybrid processors are needed to solve complex biological problems. Introducing randomness into a hybrid processor network that employs thousands of processors requires special techniques. We are proposing a solution to mega-core architectures with multi-type processors. Our aim in this work is to obtain a very large collaborative network of hybrid processors that has reconfigurable random topology. Our solution provides reconfiguration of a large network with different types of processors so that the network can be adapted to many different problems or can be used to mimic different metabolic functions. In this work, we are trying to solve the speed problem in artificial olfaction systems by a hybrid processor feature extractor that performs spatio-temporal coding inspired from nature. The technique is also efficient in realization; it is based on adding an 'identity' pin that will be used to reconfigure the identical processors. In this work we propose our technique to generate hybrid processor populations on any array platform or networks of single type processors and report the implementation on FPGA."
1430631,15237,8500,A 0.18µm CMOS SoC for a 100m-range 10fps 200×96-pixel time-of-flight depth sensor,2013,"A number of potentially low-cost time-of-flight (ToF) 3D image sensors aiming at consumer electronics applications have recently appeared in CMOS. Diffused-light sensors taking advantage of SPAD pixels, conventional and pinned-photodiode lock-in pixels demonstrate centimeter-ranging performance in distances of typically up to 6m, and with the exception of, under low background light (BG) conditions. In those approaches, however, performance tends to rapidly deteriorate in severe BG conditions, such as outdoors, and long-distance ranges have yet to be reported. Another common limitation is their inability to cope with multi-echo target environments. Higher optical signal-to-background ratio (SBR), and hence better performance, is typically achieved by laser-scanning approaches, e.g. employing polygonal or MEMS mirrors. With the emerging need for high-resolution light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technologies in advanced driving-assistance systems (ADAS), we introduce an SoC that performs time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) and complete DSP for a 100m-range ToF sensor. The chip provides the system-level electronics with a serial and low-bit-rate digital interface for: multi-echo distance, distance reliability, intensity, and BG-only intensity, thus mitigating system-level complexity and cost."
1625622,15237,9836,PyMTL: A Unified Framework for Vertically Integrated Computer Architecture Research,2014,"Technology trends prompting architects to consider greater heterogeneity and hardware specialization have exposed an increasing need for vertically integrated research methodologies that can effectively assess performance, area, and energy metrics of future architectures. However, constructing such a methodology with existing tools is a significant challenge due to the unique languages, design patterns, and tools used in functional-level (FL), cycle-level (CL), and register-transfer-level (RTL) modeling. We introduce a new framework called PyMTL that aims to close this computer architecture research methodology gap by providing a unified design environment for FL, CL, and RTL modeling. PyMTL leverages the Python programming language to create a highly productive domain-specific embedded language for concurrent-structural modeling and hardware design. While the use of Python as a modeling and framework implementation language provides considerable benefits in terms of productivity, it comes at the cost of significantly longer simulation times. We address this performance-productivity gap with a hybrid JIT compilation and JIT specialization approach. We introduce Sim JIT, a custom JIT specialization engine that automatically generates optimized C++ for CL and RTL models. To reduce the performance impact of the remaining unspecialized code, we combine Sim JIT with an off-the-shelf Python interpreter with a meta-tracing JIT compiler (PyPy). Sim JIT+PyPy provides speedups of up to 72× for CL models and 200× for RTL models, bringing us within 4--6× of optimized C++ code while providing significant benefits in terms of productivity and usability."
1741595,15237,8500,A 45nm 6b/cell charge-trapping flash memory using LDPC-based ECC and drift-immune soft-sensing engine,2013,"To satisfy the demand of higher storage density, storing multiple-bits-per-cell technique is widely adopted. As presented in [1], a 4b/cell Flash memory by using error-detection (ED) scheme stores 2b data on two sides of a memory cell individually. Since the noise margin becomes smaller, the distribution drifts due to program disturb, data retention and temperature variation will cause higher raw bit-error-rate (RBER) if the sensing level (voltage) are not adjusted accordingly. The ED scheme can detect the drift direction by counting and storing the number of cells (Ni) with threshold voltage (V TH ) below the i th  sensing level (V REF i ). A simple example with page size 1KB is demonstrated in Fig. 12.7.1. During a read operation, the number of cells (N i, measured ) whose V TH  below V REF i  is counted and compared to N i . The ED scheme can find out a sub-optimal sensing level when N i, measured  and N i  is close enough. In this paper, a production 16Gb 45nm 4b/cell ONO-based charge-trapping (CT) Flash memory is demonstrated to achieve 6b/cell capability. Since the adjacent distributions for 6b/cell are much closer to each other, even a BCH code with ED scheme fails to correct all the patterns. However, by using a new 1-3-3 mapping and LDPC codes with a developed drift-immune soft-sensing (DI-SS) engine, the 45nm 4b/cell CT Flash memory is boosted to 6b/cell. The data flow of programming data is also shown in Fig. 12.7.1."
905595,15237,23907,An asymmetric dual-channel reconfigurable receiver for GNSS in 180nm CMOS,2013,"A fully integrated dual-channel reconfigurable receiver supporting all the GNSS (GPS, Compass, GLONASS, Galileo) signals in 180nm CMOS is presented. The two channels share the frequency synthesizer and RF front-end circuits, but employ separate IF strips to support simultaneous dual-constellation reception. In order to save the power of digital baseband, one of the two IF strips can be configured to a dual-conversion mode, which lowers the highest signal frequency and thus the sampling rate. The two asymmetric channels are designed with different bandwidths, covering from 2.2MHz to 20MHz for both civil and high precision applications. Besides, I/Q mismatch calibration is introduced into each down-conversion to improve the image rejection ratio (IRR). The highly integrated receiver also integrates on-chip LDOs, crystal oscillator, AFC, AGC and DCOC modules. Thanks to the flexible frequency plan and scalable IF circuits, the typical dual-channel power consumption can be reduced to 45mW. The receiver finally achieves 2.5dB noise figure, 40dB minimum IRR, 55dB dynamic range with 1dB gain steps and -57dBm input referred in-band 1dB compression point. The result of collaboration with digital baseband shows that the chip achieves positioning with >40dB carrier to noise ratio (CNR)."
774802,15237,23593,Automatic multidimensional memory partitioning for FPGA-based accelerators (abstract only),2013,"With the increase of data processing throughput in reconfigurable computing, data parallelism is now crucial for the performance of FPGA-based accelerators. However, most of the data parallelism optimizations are still performed manually by experienced hardware designers. Memory partitioning is widely adopted to efficiently increase the memory bandwidth by using multiple memory banks and reducing data access conflict. Previous methods for memory partitioning mainly focused on one-dimensional arrays. As a consequence, designers must flatten a multidimensional array to fit those methodologies, but it makes the partition related to the dimensional width of the array. In this work we propose an automatic memory partitioning scheme for multidimensional arrays to provide high data throughput of on-chip memories for the loop pipelining in high-level synthesis. Linear transformation is applied to optimize the layout of the data elements in the memory banks, with the partition unrelated to the dimensional width. Two transformation vectors are used to map the original data element onto different banks and different inner bank offsets. The vector for the optimal bank mapping is decided by non-conflict access constraint. In addition, a memory padding technique is proposed to find a vector for inner bank offset with a trade-off between practicality and optimality. We use six benchmarks with different access patterns to prove our idea. Compared to the previous one-dimensional partitioning work, the experimental results show that our approach saves up to 21% of block RAMs, 19% in slices, and 46% in DSPs."
1349635,15237,8500,A 1.15Gb/s fully parallel nonbinary LDPC decoder with fine-grained dynamic clock gating,2013,"The primary design goal of a communication or storage system is to allow the most reliable transmission or storage of more information at the lowest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). State-of-the-art channel codes including turbo and binary LDPC have been extensively used in recent applications [1-2] to close the gap towards the lowest possible SNR, known as the Shannon limit. The recently developed nonbinary LDPC (NB-LDPC) code, defined over Galois field (GF), holds great promise for approaching the Shannon limit [3]. It offers better coding gain and a lower error floor than binary LDPC. However, the complex nonbinary decoding prevents any practical chip implementation to date. A handful of FPGA designs and chip synthesis results have demonstrated throughputs up to only 50Mb/s [4-6]. In this paper, we present a 1.15Gb/s fully parallel decoder of a (960, 480) regular-(2, 4) NB-LDPC code over GF(64) in 65nm CMOS. The natural bundling of global interconnects and an optimized placement permit 87% logic utilization that is significantly higher than a fully parallel binary LDPC decoder [7]. To achieve high energy efficiency, each processing node detects its own convergence and applies dynamic clock gating, and the decoder terminates when all nodes are clock gated. The dynamic clock gating and termination reduce the energy consumption by 62% for energy efficiency of 3.37nJ/b, or 277pJ/b/iteration, at a 1V supply."
1946971,15237,23907,A 38.6nV/Hz 0.5 −59.6dB THD dual-band micro-electrode array signal acquisition IC,2011,"Cellular field potential includes local field potential (LFP, 0.1Hz∼200Hz) and spike potential (SP, 200Hz∼10kHz). SP signal has been the focus of physiological studies. Recent study shows that the LFP signal plays important roles in modulating many profound cellular mechanisms. Although many bio-signal acquisition circuits have been reported over the years, few designs are applicable for both LFP and SP signals. To record both signals accurately, acquisition circuits need low noise and good linearity in both bands. In this paper, we report the design of a dual-band acquisition IC for microelectrode array (MEA) recording. The novel design uses a continuous-time (CT) front-end with chopping to suppress the noise, and a discrete-time (DT) back-end to achieve good linearity. A prototype monolithic acquisition IC is fabricated in a 0.35um CMOS process. It has 16 acquisition channels and a 11bit successive-approximation (SAR) ADC. Every channel achieves 38.6nV/Hz 0.5  noise and &#60;0.1% nonlinearity. The good linearity effectively prevents the aliasing and mixing between the two bands. For LFP signal, the recording noise is 0.9V rms . For SP signal, the recording noise is 3.9uV rms . For MEA recording, the new design has high input impedance (320MΩ@ 1kHz). The fully differential design has high CMRR (>110dB) and PSRR (>110dB). NEF of the new design is 6.4. The IC is experimented with rat cardio-myocytes recording."
2535900,15237,8500,Real-time current-waveform sensor with plugless energy harvesting from AC power lines for home/building energy-management systems,2011,"Home/building energy-management systems (EMSs) driven by information technology are expected to be key to the achievement of an upgraded energy infrastructure, such as Smart Grid. While EMS may offer monitoring, reporting, and control of energy usage, these functions simply track intermittently the energy consumption and operational states of certain appliances and equipments. Further, since their sensing devices are not small, they cannot be attached to every appliance or piece of equipment. Some EMSs gather information, rather, at the power-distribution-board level or the multi-output-tap level. We report here a TX-integrated battery-free real-time current-waveform sensor. It is small enough to be attached to any piece of equipment for continuous power-consumption monitoring. Its key features are : 1) plugless energy harvesting (EH) from AC power lines, 2) real-time sensing and transmitting that use a half-cycle time-to-digital convertor (TDC) to detect detailed information on current-waveforms with the precise time-resolution, and 3) asymmetrical power consumption, which helps to achieve high-power RF transmission with a limited EH power supply. Our sensor provides the 1mW power supply from an EH unit, as well as the −5.5dBm RF output power at the 50kS/s sampling with a 1mW EH power supply. We also demonstrate transmission of sensed current-waveform information of several appliances such as a hair dryer, a TV, a notebook PC."
2391663,15237,8500,A 6.5mW inductorless CMOS frequency divider-by-4 operating up to 70GHz,2011,"With a cut-off frequency in excess of 250GHz, nanometer-scale CMOS technology is rapidly expanding from Radio Frequency to mm-Waves applications. Frequency dividers are key building blocks for LO generation in wireless transceivers and clock synchronization in front-ends for wire-line and optical communications. Dividers based on traditional static CML latches work over a wide band but power dissipation at mm-Waves is extremely large. To save power, recently reported mm-Wave PLLs propose tunable narrowband dividers, based on injection-locking techniques, together with digital calibration algorithms [1,2]. On the other hand, for division factors higher than 2, the frequency locking range of injection-locked oscillators is very limited, mandating fine and frequent calibrations. This paper introduces clocked differential amplifiers, working as dynamic CML latches, to realize high speed and low power mm-Wave dividers. The solution is very compact, which is particularly desirable at mm-Waves to ease chip layout and shorten IC interconnections, minimizing signal losses. A frequency divider-by-4 has been realized in a 65nm bulk CMOS technology and prototypes prove an operating frequency programmable from 20 to 70GHz. The frequency range in each sub-band spans from 10% to 17%, corresponding to a 2.5x to 4x improvement compared to injection-locked dividers-by-4. Maximum power dissipation is 6.5mW and occupied area is only 15μm × 30μm."
2108142,15237,23593,Transformations for throughput optimization in high-level synthesis (abstract only),2014,"Programming productivity of FPGA devices remains a significant challenge, despite the emergence of robust high level synthesis tools to automatically transform codes written in high-level languages into RTL implementations. Focusing on a class of programs with regular loop bounds and array accesses (so-called affine programs), the polyhedral compilation framework provides a convenient environment to automate many of the manual program transformation tasks that are still needed to improve the QoR of the HLS tool.   In this work, we demonstrate that tiling-driven affine loop transformations, while mandatory to ensure good data reuse and reduce off-chip communication volumes, are not always enough to achieve the best throughput, determined by the Initiation Interval (II) for loop pipelining. We develop additional techniques to optimize the computation part to be executed on the FPGA, using Index-Set Splitting (ISS) to split loops into sub-loops with different properties (sequential/parallel, different memory port conflicts features). This is motivated by the presence of non-uniform data dependences in some affine benchmarks, which are not effectively handled by the affine transformation system for tiling implemented in the PolyOpt/HLS software. We develop a customized affine+ISS optimization algorithm that aims at reducing the II of pipelined inner loops to reduce the program latency. We report experimental results on numerous affine computations."
1390326,15237,8494,Power-scalable multi-mode reconfigurable continuous-time lowpass/quadrature bandpass sigma-delta modulator for zero/low-IF receivers,2012,"A multi-mode reconfigurable wideband continuous-time lowpass/quadrature bandpass sigma-delta (CT LP/QBP ΣΔ) modulator employing power scaling technique (PST) for LTE-advanced/industry-specialized zero/low-IF receivers is presented. The proposed modulator consists of a loop filter with active-RC integrator configured as 3 rd -order lowpass or 2 nd -order complex bandpass architecture and 4-bit internal quantizer operating at 80MHz, 160MHz and 320MHz, respectively. A programmable differential current-steering DAC unit is adopted for high linearity. In LP mode, the excess loop delay is set to half the sampling period of the quantizer and an additional feedback DAC is used to maintain stability, which is not used in QBP mode. The modulator employs flexible high gain and high bandwidth amplifiers with PST to optimize power consumption among various modes. Implemented in 65nm CMOS, the modulator achieves 84.8/85.8/84.5dB SNDR, 94.9/94.1/94.6dB SFDR over 2.5/5/10-MHz signal bands in LP modes and 83.8/ 84.6dB SNDR, 94.3/96dB SFDR across 2.5/5-MHz bandwidth with programmable center frequencies of 2/4-MHz in QBP modes, respectively. Powered by a 1.2-V supply, the modulator consumes 1.8 to 4.2mW, which results in simulated FOMs of 15.5 to 27.8fJ/conversion."
893304,15237,8335,Formal verification of distributed controllers using Time-Stamped Event Count Automata,2013,"We study distributed controllers where sensor, controller, and actuator tasks are mapped onto different processors or Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in a distributed automotive architecture, communicating via a shared bus. Controllers in such setups are designed with a sampling period equal to the worst-case sensor-to-actuator message delay. However, this assumption of all messages having to meet their deadlines is too pessimistic. The inherent robustness of most controllers allows some of the messages to miss their deadlines, while still meeting specified control performance constraints. Given a controller, in this paper we first quantify the frequency of its acceptable deadline misses and represent this as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. Further, we model the distributed architecture as a network of Time-Stamped Event Count Automata (TS-ECAs). Such a network of TS-ECAs is then model-checked to verify whether it satisfies the LTL formula. The verification ensures that the controller may be mapped onto the architecture and the control performance constraints will be satisfied. We have implemented this methodology in Symbolic Analysis Laboratory (SAL), which is a well-known framework combining different tools for system verification. Our implementation and case studies using standard controller design shows the applicability of our proposed controller/architecture co-verification. It represents a significant improvement in current design flows where, although controller models are formally verified, their implementation on a distributed architecture is done in an ad hoc fashion with extensive testing and integration effort."

1689466,15237,23907,A 50 μW/Ch artifacts-insensitive neural recorder using frequency-shaping technique,2013,"This paper presents a frequency-shaping (FS) neural recording interface that can inherently reject electrode offset, 5-10 times increase input impedance, 4.5-bit extend system dynamic range (DR), and provide much more tolerance to motion artifacts and 50/60 Hz power noise interferences. It is supposed to be more suitable for long-term brain-machine-interface (BMI) experiments. To achieve the mentioned performance above, the proposed architecture adopts an auto-zero offset calibration to avoid system saturation, a delayed-signaling noise cancellation to attenuate kT/C noise, and an automatical data-splitting technique to reduce input-referred noise at low frequencies.

999615,15237,23593,Pipelining FPPGA-based defect detction in FPDs (abstract only),2014,"The real-time detection of defects in Flat-Panel Displays (FPDs) is very important during the production stages. This paper describes the manner in which defects induced by bubbles are detected as fast as possible by using 4-stage image processing pipelines with 3-line buffers on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The image processing consists of reading a Time Delay Integration (TDI) image, Laplacian filtering, binarization, and labeling. TDI is applied to the initial image of the FPD to reduce noises induced when taking the FPD images. Laplacian filtering and binarization are used to detect the edges in the image, and labeling is used to number the objects in the image for defect detection. In the 4-stage pipelining, the first stage reads the TDI image from the Block Random Access Memory (BRAM), the second stage implements Laplacian filtering and binarization, the third stage implements labeling, and the final stage revises the labels and writes them into the BRAM. The target pixel and its eight surrounding neighbors are required during Laplacian filtering, and four neighbors are necessary during labeling. Thus, three line registers (3-line buffer) are used as a general pipeline register between two neighboring stages in our system. The pipelining system accesses these 3-line buffers and runs four image processing steps in parallel. Therefore, the system uses four different addresses to access the BRAM and the 3-line buffers. Further, to facilitate performance comparison, we implemented sequential image processing systems with 3-line buffers on FPGA and CPU software. The experiments reveal that Laplacian filtering, binarization, and labeling for FPD defect detection can be executed in less than 1 ms by using four-stage pipelining on an FPGA, which is 3.62 times faster than the sequential system and 158.7 times faster than the CPU software. The pipelining system is 28% larger as compared to the sequential system in terms of the size of the LUTs."
764674,15237,8500,A digital single-wire multiswitch (DSWM) channel-stacking IC in 45nm CMOS for satellite outdoor units,2013,"The evolution of direct-to-home transmit/receive systems requires a solution to aggregate, switch and route signals from multiple satellites to multiple set-top boxes efficiently. Prior solutions required separate coax cables to carry signals from each low-noise block (LNB) to set-top boxes in the home, resulting in high installation cost. An existing solution called analog single-wire multiswitch (ASWM) channel stacking uses an analog frequency translation switch located near the antenna LNB to select and output signals from multiple LNB's to a fixed frequency slot for each set-top box on a single cable [1]. Although the ASWM solution solves the problem of multiple cables, it does not provide enough flexibility and capability to increase the number of inputs, and it requires multiple external components like SAW filters which in turn would significantly increase cost [2]. This paper introduces an integrated digital single-wire multiswitch (DSWM) channel-stacking IC implemented in 45nm CMOS, which uses digital signal processing after wideband 9b 1.82GS/s ADC's to select and reorder transponder channels. The selected and reordered channels are digitally upconverted and are stacked into L-band through a 9b 5.46GS/s DAC. It removes the need of in-band SAW filters, offers a full flexibility of channel selection, and supports many more satellites through a single L-band cable to set-top boxes at much lower cost and lower power consumption."

1163752,15237,8500,A 464GOPS 620GOPS/W heterogeneous multi-core SoC for image-recognition applications,2012,"The use of image recognition technologies is becoming more popular recently in a variety of industries such as automotive, surveillance, and others. SoCs for such image recognition applications are required to be powerful enough to support real-time multiple object recognition, with power consumption not exceeding a few Watts. Adaptability to a range of applications is also desirable. In this context, massively parallel processors [1] and heterogeneous many-core processors [2] with 200GOPS have been proposed. However, rising demands for simultaneous execution of multiple applications leads to even higher performance requirements. In advanced driver-assistance systems for automotive, for example, forward collision warning and traffic sign recognition should execute simultaneously to improve safety of the system. In addition, the accuracy of recognition is also important. With its high accuracy (96% detection rate/0.1% false-positive rate), object recognition using co-occurrence histograms of oriented gradients (CoHOG) is a promising algorithm [3]. However, the algorithm requires an extensive amount of computation. For example, a desktop computer with a 3GHz quad-core processor is needed for CoHOG-based pedestrian detection in a backover prevention (BOP) application. Considering these requirements, we have developed an image recognition SoC with the following features: 1) a multi-core processor to provide adaptability to various applications; 2) accelerators for image processing tasks and image recognition tasks to realize high performance at low power consumption; and, 3) a hardware accelerator for a CoHOG based real-time recognition."
1023279,15237,23907,Compact and behavioral modeling of transistors from NVNA measurements: New flows and future trends,2012,"This paper reviews three modern transistor modeling flows enabled by large-signal waveform and/or X-parameter 1  measurements from a commercially available nonlinear vector network analyzer (NVNA) instrument. NVNA transistor characterization more safely exercises the device over a wider operating domain than is possible with conventional DC and linear S-parameter measurements, is more indicative of the device large-signal response in actual use conditions, provides data at much faster timescales than pulsed I–V methods, and provides large-signal model validation as a free additional benefit. In the first flow considered, NVNA waveform data is used as a target to extract and tune compact model parameter values and for model validation under large-signal conditions. In the second flow, NVNA waveform data is used to directly construct the multi-variate nonlinear current-source and charge-based nonlinear capacitor functions of an advanced electrothermal and trap-dependent compact model suitable for GaAs and GaN FETs, effectively bypassing the need for explicit model constitutive relation formulation. The final approach is based on the X-parameter measurement and behavioral modeling framework supported by the NVNA, producing nonlinear transistor models directly in the frequency domain. Recent advances in X-parameter methods for transistors, including simple scalability with geometry, show early potential for useful device models, under certain conditions, without the requirement of specifying an internal topology or equivalent circuit at all."
1889187,15237,9836,Multi retention level STT-RAM cache designs with a dynamic refresh scheme,2011,"Spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) has received increasing attention because of its attractive features: good scalability, zero standby power, non-volatility and radiation hardness. The use of STT-RAM technology in the last level on-chip caches has been proposed as it minimizes cache leakage power with technology scaling down. Furthermore, the cell area of STT-RAM is only 1/9 ~ 1/3 that of SRAM. This allows for a much larger cache with the same die footprint, improving overall system performance through reducing cache misses. However, deploying STT-RAM technology in L1 caches is challenging because of the long and power-consuming write operations. In this paper, we propose both L1 and lower level cache designs that use STT-RAM. In particular, our designs use STT-RAM cells with various data retention time and write performances, made possible by different magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) designs. For the fast STT-RAM bits with reduced data retention time, a counter controlled dynamic refresh scheme is proposed to maintain the data validity. Our dynamic scheme saves more than 80% refresh energy compared to the simple refresh scheme proposed in previous works. A L1 cache built with ultra low retention STT-RAM coupled with our proposed dynamic refresh scheme can achieve 9.2% in performance improvement, and saves up to 30% of the total energy when compared to one that uses traditional SRAM. For lower level caches with relative large cache capacity, we propose a data migration scheme that moves data between portions of the cache with different retention characteristics so as to maximize the performance and power benefits. Our experiments show that on the average, our proposed multi retention level STT-RAM cache reduces 30 ~ 70% of the total energy compared to previous works, while improving IPC performance for both 2-level and 3-level cache hierarchy."
1484378,15237,8494,Reconfigurable feeding network for GSM/GPS/3G/WiFi and global LTE applications,2013,"This paper presents a novel miniaturized reconfigurable and switchable feeding network to cover GSM, GPS, 3G, WiFi and global LET standards. The feeding network consists of four conventional Wilkinson power dividers which can be individually reconfigured in length using PIN diodes switches. By controlling the bias voltages of these PIN diodes, the operating frequency of the proposed design can be converted between four different bands: 600MHz-900MHz, 1.2GHz-1.6GHz, 1.8GHz-2.2GHz and 2.4GHz-2.6GHz. The first frequency band (600MHz-900MHz) is applied to satisfy the applications of LTE US (700MHz), LTE UK (800MHz) and GSM (850MHz, 900MHz). The second band (1.2GHz-1.6GHz) targets GPS L1 (1.575GHz) and GPS L2 (1.227GHz). Different GSM (1800MHz, 1900MHz) and 3G standards (UMTS, W-CDMA, TD-SCDMA and CDMA2000) are located in the third frequency band (1.8GHz-2.2GHz). The last band (2.4GHz-2.6GHz) is used to cover WiFi (2.45GHz) and LTE Europe (2.6GHz). The miniaturized and optimized feeding network exhibits good performance for S-Parameters in each band, which includes low return loss, equal power splitting and suitable insertion loss. Within the simulation environment, three types of PIN diode models were constructed and investigated in order to improve accuracy. The feeding network is implemented on an FR4 substrate. Fabrication and measurement results closely correlate with those obtained during design simulations. The reconfigurable feeding network can be particularly applied to commercial multiband communication systems."
2290511,15237,8500,A fully integrated 60GHz CMOS transceiver chipset based on WiGig/IEEE802.11ad with built-in self calibration for mobile applications,2013,"A 60GHz short-range wireless system offers new opportunities for achieving wireless high-definition video links and multi-Gb/s wireless data transfer. Recent works have realized a 60GHz transceiver by means of a cost-effective CMOS process [1-3], but using a 60GHz system in mobile terminals poses the difficult challenge of achieving low power consumption as well as small form factor. The publication [3] achieves a power consumption of less than 756mW, but uses a simple MAC protocol incompatible with global standards and also suffers from a limited distance of less than 4cm. This paper presents a fully integrated transceiver chipset based on WiGig/IEEE802.11ad standards targeting mobile usage. The chipset is developed for a single-carrier (SC) modulation, which is suitable for reduced power consumption as compared to using OFDM modulation. However, the SC modulation is sensitive to in-band amplitude variation, mainly made worse by the gain variation of analog circuits and multipath delay spread. In order to compensate for those gain variations, the proposed chipset employs built-in TX in-band calibration and an RX frequency domain equalizer (FDE). The proposed techniques can relax the requirement for high speed analog circuits, leading to less power consumption while minimizing the increase of hardware size."
1024861,15237,23593,EPEE: an efficient PCIe communication library with easy-host-integration property for FPGA accelerators (abstract only),2014,"The rapid growth in the resources and processing power of FPGA has made it more and more attractive as accelerator platforms. Due to its high performance, the PCIe bus is the preferred interconnection between the host computer and loosely-coupled FPGA accelerators. To fully utilize the high performance of PCIe, developers have to write significant amount of PCIe related code. In this paper, we present the design of EPEE, an efficient PCIe communication library that can integrate with hosts easily to alleviate developers from such burden. It is not trivial to make a PCIe communication library highly efficient and easy-host-integration simultaneously. We have identified several challenges in the work: 1) the conflict between efficiency and functionality; 2) the support for multi-clock domain interface; 3) the solution to DMA data out-of-order transfer; 4) the portability. Few existing systems have addressed all the challenges. EEPE has a highly efficient core library that is extensible. We provide a set of APIs abstracted at high levels to ease the learning curve of developers, and divide the hardware library into device dependent and independent layers for portability. We have implemented EEPE in various generations of Xilinx FPGAs with up to 12.7 Gbps half-duplex and 20.8 Gbps full-duplex data rates in PCIe Gen2X4 mode (79.4% and 64.0% of the theoretical maximum data rates respectively). EEPE has already been used in four different FPGA applications, and it can be integrated with high-level synthesis tools, in particular Vivado-HLS."

The SoC described in this work is a unique device designed for rapid integration and customization for specific market segments. A rich multi-source IP eco-system consisting of standardized interfaces, modular and configurable building blocks, enables automation and fast execution to deliver a broad range of targeted solutions. Integrating high-performance digital circuits with analog and RF circuits on a leading edge process enables our SoC architecture to increase the level of integration, performance and reduce the cost of the platform.

The chipset is comprised of a 632.7-mW/24.99-mm 2  modem/router chip and a 364-mW/11.05- mm 2  dual-band 2 × 2 MIMO RF transceiver chip, both developed in 65-nm CMOS process. The proposed chipset is capable of handling a maximum peak WiMAX downlink (DL) throughput of 70 Mbps. Moreover, the chipset can reach up to -100.5-dBm sensitivity in a 10-MHz AWGN channel, which outperforms WiMAX Forum mobile radio conformance test (MRCT) by 9.5 dB. Such high sensitivity is due to the proposed low-noise high-linearity RF transceiver chip, which has 2.5-dB RX noise figure (NF) and -37-dB TX error vector magnitude (EVM), and the applied high-performance baseband signal processing algorithms. Several low-power design techniques-from SW level, firmware/DSP level, to HW module level-have been implemented to enable portable applications. The modem/router chip is highly integrated and has rich features and various interfaces for applications such as router or VoIP phone.

1655173,15237,23593,Co-simulation framework of SystemC SoC virtual prototype and custom logic (abstract only),2013,"To address the increasing demand of System-on-Chip (SoC) for high performance applications and IP programmability, specialized SoC with custom logic is developed in a single chip or multi-chip system. Like any other SoC platforms, early software development before hardware availability using a Virtual Prototype (VP) is essential. However, the existing RTL for custom logic makes it non-trivial to simulate the entire system with software models written in high-level language (i.e. SystemC/C/C++). In this paper, we describe our unique virtual prototyping framework called FPGA-In-the-Loop (FIL) to enable co-simulation of software models in the VP and custom logic running in the FPGA at native speed. This platform enables designers to start early software development and integration of the entire hardware platform without needing to develop software models for custom logic. More importantly, our contributions lie in overcoming two of the biggest challenges in such co-simulation systems; 1) the communication channel performance bottleneck and 2) software-visible asynchronous signal timing correctness (i.e. interrupt). Our framework was able to 1) optimize communications between the VP and FPGA to achieve up to 872 Mbps effective throughput and 2) guarantee software-visible asynchronous signal delivery timing (i.e. interrupts) between the two simulation domains. Finally, we implemented our framework on a commercial hybrid platform with SoC and FPGA to demonstrate the complete embedded Linux stack communicating with custom video/touchscreen IPs running in the FPGA."
1620363,15237,8500,A 0.94mW/Gb/s 22Gb/s 2-tap partial-response DFE receiver in 40nm LP CMOS,2013,"A decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) reconstructs the post-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) pattern from the detected data sequence and subtracts it from the received signal before detecting the next symbol. Therefore, DFE's operating speed is fundamentally limited by a 1-unit-interval (UI) feedback loop that is often the critical path in high-speed designs. Partial-response DFE (prDFE) architectures push the feedback loop away from the analog front-end to the post-slicer domain by making redundant decisions, as shown in Fig. 2.8.1(a). Since distinction between post and current data requires a sequential element to prevent a race, a latch overhead exists in the critical path of many prDFE designs [1]. For a 1-tap prDFE, the design in [2] entirely eliminates the sequential element from the critical path leveraging a unique race-free property of 1-tap half-rate prDFE. However, the architecture is not extendable to larger number of taps. For a 2-tap prDFE, overhead of the sequential element is reduced in a quarter-rate architecture. Figure 2.8.1(b) shows the block diagram of a receiver front-end with a shared CTLE, half-rate slicers and a quarter-rate prDFE. The critical path in the quarter-rate implementation is limited by a 2:1 mux delay (T mux ) and a flop setup and clock-to-output overhead (T FF ), as shown in Fig. 2.8.2(a). Assuming T FF  = 2T mux , the loop delay increases by 200% compared to the absolute minimum for speculation, T mux . Figure 2.8.2(a) also shows the race that is prevented by employing the sequential elements in a quarter-rate implementation."
1888572,15237,8500,A 12-Gb/s Non-Contact Interface With Coupled Transmission Lines,2011,"The expanding capacity of today's memory cards and increasing speed of processors have created demands for high data rate interfaces between memory cards and processors. Compared to conventional contact pins, wireless interfaces have received tremendous interest for reasons of more convenience, higher reliability, and higher data rate. Two major types of near-field wireless communication techniques using capacitive coupling and inductive coupling channels have been investigated. Tens of Gb/s/ch is achieved using both methods with a communication distance of tens of microns in TCI (thru-chip-interface) applications [1–2]. However, when the communication distance denters the mm range in such applications as non-contact memory cards, the sizes of capacitors or inductors must be up scaled to detect enough electrical flux or magnetic flux, whose magnitude decay as 1/d n  (n>1). As a result, the self-resonance frequency f SR  is reduced significantly, which becomes the dominant limiting factor for the achievable data rate, since the maximum data rate is usually chosen as 1/2 or 1/3 of f SR  in order to avoid signal peaking [3]. Although multi-channel solutions are viable to increase the total data rate, complex systems are required to address the skew issues in synchronization, and low area efficiency is resulted to reduce crosstalk interferences as shown in Fig. 28.3.1."
2184409,15237,20649,Dynamic effort scaling: managing the quality-efficiency tradeoff,2011,"Several recently proposed design techniques leverage the inherent error resilience of applications for improved efficiency (energy or performance). Hardware and software systems that are thus designed may be viewed as scalable effort systems, since they offer the capability to modulate the effort that they expend towards computation, thereby allowing for tradeoffs between output quality and efficiency.   We propose the concept of  Dynamic Effort Scaling  (DES), which refers to dynamic management of the control knobs that are exposed by scalable effort systems. We argue the need for DES by observing that the degree of resilience often varies significantly across applications, across datasets, and even within a dataset. We propose a general conceptual framework for DES by formulating it as a feedback control problem, wherein the scaling mechanisms are regulated with the goal of maintaining output quality within a certain specified limit. We present an implementation of Dynamic Effort Scaling in the context of a scalable-effort processor for Support Vector Machines, and evaluate it under various application scenarios and data sets. Our results clearly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach --- statically setting the scaling mechanisms leads to either significant error overshoot or significant opportunities for energy savings left on the table unexploited. In contrast, DES is able to effectively regulate the output quality while maximally exploiting the time-varying resiliency in the workload."
1731646,15237,20649,ABCD-L: approximating continuous linear systems using boolean models,2013,"We present ABCD-L, a scalable technique for Analog/Mixed Signal (AMS) modelling/verification that captures the continuous dynamics of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, using purely Boolean approximations, to any desired level of accuracy. ABCD-L's models can be used in conjunction with existing techniques for Boolean synthesis/verification/fast logic simulation, or with hybrid systems frameworks, to represent LTI dynamics without incurring the penalty of adding continuous variables. Unlike existing state-enumeration approaches like DAE2FSM [1], ABCD-L scales practically linearly with system size. We apply ABCD-L to I/O links composed of RC/RLGC units, capturing important analog effects like inter-symbol interference, overshoot/undershoot, ringing,  etc . -- all using purely Boolean models. We also present a continuous-time differential equalizer example, where ABCD-L accurately reproduces key design-relevant AMS metrics, including the eye diagram correction achieved by the circuit. Furthermore, for real-world LTI systems, we demonstrate that ABCD-L can be applied in conjunction with Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques; we use this to produce accurate Boolean models of an industry-scale power grid network (with 25849 nodes) made available by IBM. We also demonstrate that Boolean simulation using ABCD-L's models offers considerable speed-up over standard circuit simulation using linear multi-step numerical methods."
1766899,15237,8500,A 1.2 V 30 nm 3.2 Gb/s/pin 4 Gb DDR4 SDRAM With Dual-Error Detection and PVT-Tolerant Data-Fetch Scheme,2012,"A higher performance DRAM is required by the market due to the increasing of bandwidth of networks and the rise of high-capacity multimedia content. DDR4 SDRAM is the next-generation memory that meets these demands in computing and server systems. In comparison with current DDR3 memory, the major changes are supply voltage reduction to 1.2V, pseudo open drain I/O interface, and data rate increase from 1.6 to 3.2Gb/s. To achieve high performance at low supply voltage and reduce power consumption, this work introduces new functions and describes their implementation. Data bus inversion (DBI) is employed for high-speed transactions to reduce power consumption of I/O and SSN noise. Dual-error detection, which adopts cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for DQ, and command address (CA) parity is designed to guarantee reliable transmission. GDDR5 memory also has DBI and CRC functions [1], but in this work, these schemes are implemented in a way that reduces area overhead and timing penalty. Besides these error-check functions, an enhanced gain buffer and a PVT-tolerant fetch scheme improve basic receiving ability. To meet the output jitter requirements of DDR4 SDRAM, the type of delay line for DLL is selected at initial stage according to data rate."
2238203,15237,20649,Programmable analog device array (PANDA): a platform for transistor-level analog reconfigurability,2011,"The design and development of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) ICs is becoming increasingly expensive, complex, and lengthy. Lacking a reconfigurable platform, analog designers are denied the benefits of rapid prototyping, hardware emulation, and smooth migration to advanced technology nodes. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a new approach that maps any AMS design problem to a transistor-level reconfigurable vehicle, thus enabling fast validation and a reduction in post-Silicon bugs, and minimizing design risk and costs. The unique features of the approach include: (1) transistor-level programmability that emulates each transistor behavior in an analog design, reproducing the system and achieving very fine granularity of reconfiguration; (2) programmable switches that are treated as a design component during analog transistor mapping, and optimized with the reconfiguration matrix; (3) parasitics reduction that leverages the aggressive scaling of CMOS technology. Based on these principles, a digitally controlled PANDA platform is designed at a 32nm node. Several 90nm analog blocks are successfully emulated with the 32nm platform, including a folded-cascode operational amplifier, a sample-and-hold module (S/H), and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). A solid basis to future efforts on the architecture, hierarchical optimization, and related design automation tools is demonstrated."
1992950,15237,8500,A 0.45V 423nW 3.2MHz multiplying DLL with leakage-based oscillator for ultra-low-power sensor platforms,2013,"Emerging demands on ultra-low-power wireless sensor platform have presented challenges for nano-watt design of various circuit components. Clock management unit, as an essential block, is one of the most actively researched blocks. It is required to distribute various frequency ranges for energy-optimal operation, e.g., Hz for internal timer [1], kHz for global clock [2], and MHz for fast data transmission or intensive signal processing [3]. However, free-running oscillators are seriously affected by process variations and should be readjusted by post-fabrication trimming. Though a crystal gives a stable frequency, the use of multiple crystals is generally not allowed by limited form-factor and increased cost. Instead, frequency multiplication from one clean reference is more effective way for higher frequency generation. Considering high-frequency clock is only intermittently used in sensor applications, the clock multiplier should provide a fast settling when turned on as well as low-power dissipation. This paper presents a 423nW, 3.2 MHz all-digital multiplying DLL (MDLL) with a digitally controlled leakage-based oscillator (DCLO) and a fast frequency relocking scheme adaptive to the amount of frequency drift during sleep state, which is required for intermittent operation of sensor node platforms."
1599494,15237,8500,A 7Gb/s/link non-contact memory module for multi-drop bus system using energy-equipartitioned coupled transmission line,2012,"As computing power and speed increases, the demand for higher memory bandwidth increases as well. Recently, the memory interface has been improved up to 20Gb/s/link [1]. Considering PCB routing area, a multi-drop bus architecture is still preferable for large memory capacity to the point-to-point connection. However, the multi-drop approach suffers from performance degradations due to reflections at each stub. To mitigate this problem, reference [2] proposes an impedance-matched bidirectional multi-drop DQ bus architecture that is difficult to realize due to smaller series resistor if more than 4 modules are used. To avoid multi-reflections from each stub, other approaches have used coupled transmission lines (CTL) [3, 4]. While a horizontal directional coupler buried in the PCB was used [3], coupled traces on the bent loop of flex fixed to a module were used for signal delivery in vertical direction [4]. In [3], a long coupler with long main bus line was used so that the signal integrity degrades at the far-end coupler. In [4], the coupling traces on the motherboard and the flex have zigzag geometries for better misalignment tolerance, which result in large area of routing due to the minimum required pitch between traces. In [5], the CTL needs to be placed close to a Tx/Rx chip, as there are no extended transmission lines for signal lead. Therefore, it cannot be used for memory modules. DRAM multi-drop bus interface technology mapping is described in Fig. 2.8.1."

This fabric consists of 16×16 multi-functional Processing Elements (PEs) interconnected by an area-efficient Line-Switched Mesh Connect (LSMC) routing. A Hierarchical Configuration Context (HCC) organization scheme is proposed to reduce the scale of the context memory and enhance configuration efficiency. Two reconfigurable processors are then designed and fabricated to verify the proposed techniques. One processor (called REMUS_HPP) integrates two RPUs, targeting the high performance applications. REMUS_HPP could decode 1920×1080@30fps H.264 streams with 280mW under 200MHz, achieving a performance gain of 1.81x and a 14.3x energy efficiency improvement over XPP-III. The other processor (called REMUS_LPP) integrates only one RPU, targeting the low power applications. REMUS_LPP could decode 720×480@35fps H.264 streams with 24.81mW under 75MHz, achieving a 76% power reduction and a 3.96x energy efficiency improvement compared with ADRES. More importantly, RPU is not only limited to video decoding applications. It can also be used to process some other computation-intensive applications and the corresponding analysis is given in this paper as well."
2532177,15237,8500,A 0.5-to-2.5 Gb/s Reference-Less Half-Rate Digital CDR With Unlimited Frequency Acquisition Range and Improved Input Duty-Cycle Error Tolerance,2011,"Clock and data recovery (CDR) circuits with wide frequency acquisition range offer flexibility in optical communication networks, help reduce link power through activity-based rate adaptation, and minimize cost with a single-chip multi-standard solution. Extracting the bit rate from the incoming random data stream is the main challenge in implementing reference-less CDRs. A conventional rotational frequency detector has a limited acquisition range of about ±50% of the VCO frequency, consumes large power, and is susceptible to harmonic locking. Extending its range requires additional high-speed circuitry and a complex state machine [1]. The DLL-based architecture in [2] requires passing high-speed data through a long string of power-hungry buffers, imposes stringent matching requirements, and works only with ring oscillators. Other approaches require detailed statistical [3] or timing analysis [4]. Further, all the above techniques are only suitable for full-rate CDRs. In this paper, we present a reference-less half-rate CDR that uses a sub-harmonic extraction method to achieve unlimited frequency acquisition range. This technique is capable of locking the CDR to within 40ppm of any sub-rate of the data (making it applicable for any sub-rate CDR architecture), while being immune to undesirable harmonic locking. This CDR also integrates a calibration loop to improve robustness to input duty cycle error."

1309142,15237,23593,C-to-CoRAM: compiling perfect loop nests to the portable CoRAM abstraction,2013,"This paper presents initial work on developing a C compiler for the CoRAM FPGA computing abstraction. The presented effort focuses on compiling fixed-bound perfect loop nests that operate on large data sets in external DRAM. As required by the CoRAM abstraction, the compiler partitions source code into two separate implementation components: (1) hardware kernel pipelines to be mapped onto the reconfigurable logic fabric; and (2) control threads that express, in a C-like language, the sequencing and coordination of data transfers between the hardware kernels and external DRAM. The compiler performs optimizations to increase parallelism and use DRAM bandwidth efficiently. It can target different FPGA platforms that support the CoRAM abstraction, either natively in a future FPGA or in soft-logic on today's devices. The CoRAM abstraction provides a convenient high-level compilation target to simplify the task of design optimization and system generation. The compiler is evaluated using three test programs (matrix-matrix multiplication, k-nearest neighbor, and 2D convolution) on the Xilinx ML605 and the Altera DE4. Results show that our compiler is able to target the different platforms and effectively exploit their dissimilar capacities and features.

More recently, some of the state of the art processor arrays have been used for real-time machine vision tasks such as intelligent transport system applications [2] or video processing on mobile applications [3] providing a much more powerful solution than a conventional processor. A number of Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) processor arrays have been implemented on FPGAs [4]-[6], which are particularly suited to implementing such processor architectures because of their similarities of both being arrays of fine grained logic elements. In this work, we propose an FPGA implementation of a processor array where the processing elements (PEs) are as small as possible, while providing local memory sufficient for processing greyscale images. The PE is then replicated to form an array. A 32 × 32 PE array is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex 5 XC5VLX50 FPGA using the four-neighbour connectivity with the possibility to scale up using a larger FPGA. The processor array operates at a frequency of 96 MHz and executes a peak of 98.3 giga operations per second (GOPS) (bit-serial operations). A binary edge detection algorithm is performed in 52.08 ns. Uploading and downloading a binary image in a 32 × 32 array takes an extra 687.5 ns. Sobel edge detection of an 8-bit greyscale image is performed in 5.33 µs. Uploading and downloading an 8-bit greyscale image in a 32 × 32 array takes 5.36 µs. With larger FPGAs being available in the future, the array sizes comparable to state of the art custom designed ICs can be implemented on these FPGAs."

But whether the technology in its current state will be a commercially and technically viable alternative to entrenched technologies such as flash-based SSDs remains undecided. To address this it is important to consider PCM SSD devices not just from a device standpoint, but also from a holistic perspective.#R##N##R##N#This paper presents the results of our performance study of a recent all-PCM SSD prototype. The average latency for a 4 KiB random read is 6.7 µs, which is about 16× faster than a comparable eMLC flash SSD. The distribution of I/O response times is also much narrower than flash SSD for both reads and writes. Based on the performance measurements and real-world workload traces, we explore two typical storage use-cases: tiering and caching. For tiering, we model a hypothetical storage system that consists of flash, HDD, and PCM to identify the combinations of device types that offer the best performance within cost constraints. For caching, we study whether PCM can improve performance compared to flash in terms of aggregate I/O time and read latency. We report that the IOPS/$ of a tiered storage system can be improved by 12-66% and the aggregate elapsed time of a server-side caching solution can be improved by up to 35% by adding PCM.#R##N##R##N#Our results show that - even at current price points - PCM storage devices show promising performance as a new component in enterprise storage systems."

The Sandy Bridge architecture block diagram is shown in Fig. 15.1.1 and the floorplan of a four IA-core version is shown in Fig. 15.1.2. The Sandy Bridge IA core implements an improved branch prediction algorithm, a micro-operation (Uop) cache, a floating point Advanced Vector Extension (AVX), a second load port in the L1 cache and bigger register files in the out-of-order part of the machine; all these architecture improvements boost the IA core performance without increasing the thermal power dissipation envelope or the average power consumption (to preserve battery life in mobile systems). The CPUs and GPU share the same 8MB level-3 cache memory. The data flow is optimized by a high performance on die interconnect fabric (called “ring”) that connects between the CPUs, the GPU, the L3 cache and the system agent (SA) unit that houses a 1600MT/s, dual channel DDR3 memory controller, a 20-lane PCIe gen2 controller, a two parallel pipe display engine, the power management control unit and the testability logic.

1640694,15237,8500,An AC-coupled hybrid envelope modulator for HSUPA transmitters with 80% modulator efficiency,2013,"High-data-rate wireless technologies such as HSUPA and LTE are power-hungry because of the fundamental correlation between data rate and transmit power. Furthermore, the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the modulated signals causes a degradation in PA efficiency, since the supply voltage of the PA must be high enough to provide the peak output voltage without loss of linearity. Envelope tracking modulators have been proposed to improve the efficiency and linearity of transmitters. Modulators using multiple input voltages have been shown to improve efficiency, but generating multiple supplies imposes substantial overhead. Several recent works have demonstrated a hybrid modulator, combining the output current of a buck output stage with that of a linear amplifier. The hybrid modulator has the notable advantage that the low-frequency power (which constitutes the majority of power, even in high-PAPR scenarios) can be provided through the efficient buck stage. The inherently less efficient linear amplifier stage needs only to supply the high-frequency power. The efficiency of hybrid modulators degrades at moderate power levels, when the ac amplitude is much less than the supply voltage of the linear amplifier. At low power levels, the power savings afforded by the modulator do not offset its own quiescent current, resulting in a lower efficiency than can be achieved using a fixed-drain, average-power-tracking (FD-APT) supply."
750309,15237,9772,Implementation and performance analysis of variable latency adders,2013,"Asynchronous circuit design is enjoying resurgence in the digital world, with many recent technical and practical advancements and improvements. The advantages of asynchronous systems over synchronous systems are promising. The opportunity to implement high performance data-paths is very attractive by exploiting the fact that most data-path modules have data dependent delays. In other words they compute the result faster than worst case under many input combinations. Therefore making the common case fast, asynchronous data-paths have the potential to outperform synchronous designs on average inputs. This paper is devoted to the implementation and analysis of the performance advantages that can be achieved by dynamically selecting the matched delay in a bundled-data setting. It presents the implementation and analysis of a method for the design of high performance asynchronous adders called “speculative completion” on six different 32 bit adders. The analysis on random data indicates that speculative completion yields significant performance improvements. It is also noticed that the performance improves further in case of small number additions. On average, the 32-bit Brent Kung speculative adder is 19.4% faster than a 32-bit Brent Kung without speculative completion if both inputs are 32 bits and 24.8% faster if both inputs have only 16 non zero bits. Similarly Kogge Stone and Sparse Tree adders are 24.2% faster; Ladner Fischer, Han Carlson and Sklansky are 16 %, 22.75% and 18.5 % faster respectively."
2306458,15237,8500,"A 4.1-pJ/b, 16-Gb/s Coded Differential Bidirectional Parallel Electrical Link",2012,"This paper introduces a novel signaling scheme for parallel high-speed interfaces. The new signaling, called coded differential (CD), maps two bits of information to four wires and, therefore, has the same pin-efficiency as differential signaling. The coding scheme is designed in such a way that the parallel interface preserves many of the attractive properties of a differential link such as low supply noise generation and immunity to common-mode noise. The CD receiver also incorporates differential detection with no need for a dc reference. In addition, the coding completely eliminates the first post-cursor intersymbol interference of the channel over the entire unit-interval at no loss in throughput. As a result, CD leads to substantial increase in timing margin compared with a differential link with 1-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE). Unlike DFE, CD does not require channel tap estimation. The theory of CD signaling, the optimization of the encoder and the decoder, and the implementation details of a prototype system developed based on this scheme for graphics memory interfaces are described. The full-featured interface, implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process, transfers 8 × 16 Gb/s data over 16 wires and achieves an energy efficiency of 4.1 pJ/b. Eye diagram measurements on a scope indicate 30% improvement in timing margin compared with a 1-tap predictive DFE system."
1678635,15237,20649,Obstacle-avoiding free-assignment routing for flip-chip designs,2012,"The flip-chip packaging is introduced for modern IC designs with higher integration density and larger I/O counts. It is necessary to consider routing obstacles for modern flip-chip designs, where the obstacles could be regions blocked for signal integrity protection (especially for analog/mixed-signal modules), pre-routed or power/ground nets, and even for through-silicon vias for 3D IC designs. However, no existing published works consider obstacles. To remedy this insufficiency, this paper presents the first work to solve the free-assignment flip-chip routing problem considering obstacles. For the free-assignment routing problem, most existing works apply the network-flow formulation. Nevertheless, we observe that no existing network-flow model can exactly capture the routability of a local routing region (tile) in presence of obstacles. This paper presents the first work that can precisely model the routability of a tile, even with obstacles. Based on this new model, a two-stage approach of global routing followed by detailed routing is proposed. The global routing computes a routing topology by the minimum-cost maximum-flow algorithm, and the detailed routing determines the precise wire positions. Dynamic programming is applied to further merge tiles to reduce the problem size. Compared to a state-of-the-art flow model with obstacle handling extensions, experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve 100% routability for all circuits while the extensions of the previous work cannot complete routing for any benchmark circuit with obstacles."

A combination of error detecting circuits and micro-architectural recovery mechanisms creates a system that is robust in the face of timing errors, and can be tuned to an efficient operating point by dynamically eliminating unused timing margins. Savings from margin reclamation can be realized as per device power-efficiency improvement, or parametric yield improvement for a batch of devices. In this paper, we apply Razor to a 32 bit ARM processor with a micro-architecture design that has balanced pipeline stages with critical memory access and clock-gating enable paths. The design is fabricated on a UMC 65 nm process, using industry standard EDA tools, with a worst-case STA signoff of 724 MHz. Based on measurements on 87 samples from split-lots, we obtain 52% power reduction for the overall distribution at 1 GHz operation. We present error rate driven dynamic voltage and frequency scaling schemes where runtime adaptation to PVT variations and tolerance of fast transients is demonstrated. All Razor cells are augmented with a sticky error history bit, allowing precise diagnosis of timing errors over the execution of test vectors. We show potential for parametric yield improvement through energy-efficient operation using Razor."
1073391,15237,8500,1.2Gb/s 3.9pJ/b mono-phase pulse-modulation inductive-coupling transceiver for mm-range board-to-board communication,2013,"Recently, short distance board-to-board interconnections are widely employed in portable systems and wearable devices to accommodate many components into an extremely tight footprint. In particular, portable devices such as smart phone and tablet require over 1Gb/s data transfer through ~1mm distance between AP board and a high resolution wide screen display board. Most of display interfaces are implemented with wire-line F-PCB connector, but, they suffer from: 1) high manufacturing cost, 2) the large form factor of the connector and standard socket and 3) large capacitance values of the connector and socket degrading the channel characteristics. So far, various communication interfaces have been tried to realize low cost, small form factor and low energy operation, but with limited success. The bi-phase pule modulation was used in board-to-board communication rather than base-band transmission due to its low energy operation [1-5]. This method used the positive pulse current for data `1' and the negative pulse current for data `0', and the receiver recovered the data by sampling the data at the exact time, which requires an accurate delay control unit. However, the bi-phase pulse modulation consumes significant power because: 1) current pulses sampled at every data consume large current in TX, and 2) a power hungry delay control unit is required to exactly control the sampling time."
1298562,15237,23593,Achieving modular dynamic partial reconfiguration with a difference-based flow (abstract only),2013,"Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) of Xilinx FPGAs in cases where there is significant logic difference between subsequent configurations is made possible by Xilinx module-based PR flow. Xilinx supports this flow only for high-end FPGAs and requires paid license, without which Xilinx PlanAhead software disables the related knobs and features. This poster presents a unique methodology (called DPR-LD) that enables DPR of low-end and high-end Xilinx FPGAs and requires no paid license. DPR-LD stands for DPR for Large Differences. DPR-LD uses the free Xilinx difference-based bit file generation software (bitgen), which normally is meant only for small differences between subsequent configurations. DPR-LD can be realized through either FPGA Editor or PlanAhead. Our FPGA Editor flow requires several physical constraints to ensure contention-free implementation of static and dynamic modules. We use implementation, floorplanning, and placement constraints to partition the design into several physical regions (one per module) for mapping, packing, placement, and routing. In order to avoid routing of a module to cross over another module, fortress blocks are used to isolate the modules from each other. However, fortress blocks lead to wasted FPGA resources. On the other hand, in our PlanAhead flow, the physical constraints are entered via a GUI, and the corresponding actual physical constraints are generated automatically and without wasting FPGA resources. To evaluate the two approaches, a proof-of-concept application with a single dynamic region was implemented using both flows. In addition, a multiple dynamic region design was implemented with our PlanAhead flow."

With such devices, it is possible to perform acute or chronic extracellular recordings of electrical activity from a single neuron or from groups of neurons. After the many developments in neural implants, it has become clear that large arrays of electrodes are desirable to further investigate the activity performed by complex neural networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a CMOS neural probe containing 455 active electrodes in the probe shank (100 μm wide, 10 mm long, and 50 μm thick) and 52 simultaneous readout channels in the probe body (2.9 × 3.3 mm 2 ). In situ amplification under each electrode enables low-impedance interconnection lines, regardless of the electrode impedance, with a residual crosstalk of -44.8 dB. This design has been implemented in a 0.18-μm standard CMOS technology, with additional CMOS-compatible post-processing performed at wafer level to define the electrodes and the probe outline. In this architecture, the analog front-end achieves an input-referred noise of 3.2 μV rms  and an NEF of 3.08. The power consumption of the core circuit is 949.8 μW, while the total power consumption is 1.45 mW. The high-density active-electrode array in this neural probe allows for the massive recording of neural activity. In vivo measurements demonstrate successful simultaneous recordings from many individual cells."
2040163,15237,8335,A fine-grained technique of NBTI-aware voltage scaling and body biasing for standard cell based designs,2011,"As the technology scales, the increase of circuit delay over time due to NBTI (negative bias temperature instability) effect is not negligible any more. It has been known that voltage scaling is an effective scheme that is able to mitigate the NBTI effect. However, a careful control of voltage scaling is required not to increase the dissipation of dynamic power significantly. On the other hand, body biasing can also be used to mitigate the NBTI effect by lowering down the threshold voltage, but its effectiveness is limited, as will be demonstrated in this work, and it increases the leakage power. This work addresses an important problem of minimizing the power consumption of circuit while controlling the NBTI induced delay increase to meet the circuit timing constraint by  simultaneously utilizing the effects of voltage scaling and body biasing on both NBTI and power consumption . Precisely, we solve the problem of finding a set of supply and body biasing voltage values to apply circuit clusters on standard cell based design to minimize the total power consumption while satisfying the constraint of circuit life time, considering the NBTI induced delay factor in circuit timing computation. By a comprehensive analysis on the relations between the values of supply and body biasing voltages and the values of the resulting power consumption and NBTI induced delay, we precisely formulate the problem, and transform it into a problem of convex optimization to solve it efficiently. Through extensive experimentation using ISCAS benchmark designs, it is shown that the proposed approach to the simultaneous exploitation of supply voltage and body biasing is able to produce designs with 14% and 8% reduced energy consumption on average over the designs produced by the design time NBTI-aware guard-banding based voltage scaling [20] and the run time NBTI-aware voltage scaling [4], respectively."

The goal of the 6.002x experiment was to explore ways to use computer assisted instruction to surpass the quality of traditional residential teaching. By providing superior on-line content delivery and assessment, we hope to both be able to educate people without access to education, and to improve residential education by allowing professors to focus on higher value tasks. We improved on the classroom experience in several ways. Students can actively monitor their current levels of mastery and to self-pace in response. They can identify and break through misconceptions before moving on to more advanced material. The massive scale of the classroom has participants on-line 24/7, allowing students to ask questions and receive peer answers in almost real-time. The platform allows for substantial data collection on testing, allowing us to incrementally and scientifically improve courses. Finally, the amount of effort that can be invested into a course is much greater when it can be amortized across tens of thousands. In order to achieve this, we had to overcome a number of challenges: finding mechanisms to allow automated grading, overcoming the lack of in-person interactions, and overcoming the lack of student access to laboratory equipment. The course was shown successful in both residential and mass-scale settings."

The presented radio complies with 3 short-range standards: Bluetooth Low Energy (BT-LE), IEEE802.15.4 (ZigBee) and IEEE802.15.6 (Medical Body-Area Networks, MBAN). A proprietary 2Mb/s mode is also implemented to support data-streaming applications like hearing aids. Current short-range radios for Zigbee and BT-LE typically consume more than 20mW DC power, which is rather high for autonomous systems with limited battery energy. The dual-mode MBAN/BT-LE transceiver achieves a power consumption of 6.5mW for the RX and 5.9mW for the TX by employing a sliding-IF RX and a polar TX architecture. However, it suffers from limited RX image rejection and needs a PA operating at a higher supply voltage. In this paper, an energy-efficient radio architecture with a suitable LO frequency plan is selected, and several efficiency-enhancement techniques for the critical RF circuits (e.g., a push-pull mixer and a digitally-assisted PA) are utilized. As a result, the presented transceiver dissipates only 3.8mW (RX) and 4.6mW (TX) DC power from a 1.2V supply, while exceeding all of the PHY requirements of above 3 standards."

In measurements, 10 ISCAS benchmark circuits are implemented by employing newly developed CAD tools which consist of VT mapper as well as placer and router. Mask layout shows that well-separated margins, programmable body bias circuits, and additional configuration memories occupy 54% of the FPGA tile area. Measurement results show that the fabricated FPGA reduces the static current by 91.4% in average. In addition, evaluations by implementing ring oscillator with various body bias voltage pairs demonstrate the static current reduction from 23.1 uA to 1.0 uA by assigning low threshold voltage and high threshold voltage to MOSFETs on a critical path and the rest of the MOSFETs, respectively while maintaining the same oscillation frequency of 6.6 MHz as the frequency when all MOSFETs are assigned low threshold voltage. Moreover the fine-grain programmable body bias technique accelerates the oscillation frequency of ring oscillator implemented on FPGA by aggressively applying forward body bias voltage, while assignment of HVT to MOSFETs on the non-critical path by applying the reverse body biasing effectively suppresses exponential increase of static current caused by the forward body biasing."
1791325,15237,23593,Reducing the pressure on routing resources of FPGAs with generic logic chains,2011,"Routing resources in modern FPGAs use 50% of the silicon real estate and are significant contributors to critical path delay and power consumption; the situation gets worse with each successive process generation, as transistors scale more effectively than wires. To cope with these challenges, FPGA architects have divided wires into local and global categories and introduced fast dedicated carry chains between adjacent logic cells, which reduce routing resource usage for certain arithmetic circuits (primarily adders and subtractors).   Inspired by the carry chains, we generalize the idea to connect lookup tables (LUTs) in adjacent logic cells. By exploiting the fracturable structure of LUTs in current FPGA generations, we increase the utilization of the existing LUTs in the logic cell by providing new inputs along the logic chain, but without increasing the I/O bandwidth from the programmable interconnect. This allows us to increase the logic density of the configurable logic cells while reducing demand for routing resources, as long as the mapping tools are able to exploit the logic chains. Our experiments using the combinational MCNC benchmarks and comparing against an Altera Stratix-III FPGA show that the introduction of logic chains reduce the average usage of local routing wires by 37%, with a 12% reduction in total wiring (local and global); this translates to improvements in dynamic power consumption of 18% in the routing network and 10% overall, while utilizing 4% fewer logic cells, on average."

1264376,15237,8500,A 2-to-16GHz 204mW 3mm-resolution stepped-frequency radar for breast-cancer diagnostic imaging in 65nm CMOS,2013,"Radar imaging is gaining interest for medical, security, and industrial applications. Enabled by the advances in silicon technologies, a clear trend towards higher integration is observed [1-3]. Early-stage breast cancer detection is a promising application for radar imaging, as first clinical trials with patients have been carried out [4]. Commercial VNAs have been used in these experiments, but custom hardware is needed to improve the sensitivity, and to decrease the size and the cost of the setup [4]. Medical radar imaging sets great challenges. The radiation must be coupled into the body, while the skin acts as a shield. The waves that penetrate beyond the skin are heavily attenuated (>80dB for a few centimeters at 10GHz [4]). Tumor cells have different electrical properties than the healthy tissue, thus reflecting the waves and allowing for detection; this contrast is frequency dependent, decreasing at higher frequencies. These fundamental limits result in a radar requiring a dynamic range in excess to 100dB [4], and force operation in the lower-GHz range. In contrast, mm-Waves would be preferred to achieve higher resolution [1]. Ultra-wideband radars combine larger scattered energy collected at lower frequencies (thus higher SNR), and mm-range resolution, since the resolution is set by the overall bandwidth and the antenna array arrangement [2]."
764205,15237,8500,A 55dB SNR with 240Hz frame scan rate mutual capacitor 30×24 touch-screen panel read-out IC using code-division multiple sensing technique,2013,"Capacitive touch-screen technology introduces new concepts to user interfaces, such as multi-touch, pinch zoom-in/out gestures, thus expanding the smartphone market. However, capacitive touch-screen technology still suffers from performance degradation like a low frame scan rate and poor accuracy, etc. One of the key performance factors is the immunity to external noise, which intrudes randomly into the touch-screen system. HUM, display noise, and SMPS are such noise sources. The main electrical power source produces HUM, one of the most important sources of noise, which has a 50 or 60Hz component. Display noise is emitted when an LCD or OLED is driven by the internal timing controller, which generates the driving signal in the tens of kHz range. The touch performance of On-Cell or In-Cell touch displays is seriously affected by this kind of noise, because the distance between the display pixel layer and the capacitive touchscreen panel is getting smaller. SMPS is another noise source that ranges up to 300kHz. The charger for a smart-phone, the USB port in a computer, a tri-phosphor fluorescent light bulb are all examples of sources of SMPS. There have been many attempts to remove such noise. Amplitude modulation with frequency hopping is proposed in [1]. However, when the noise environment changes, this method needs recalibration, resulting in non-constant touch response time. Another method tries to filter the noise from the display [2], but it does not remove other noise sources like HUM or SMPS."
1690554,15237,23593,Shadow AICs: reaping the benefits of and-inverter cones with minimal architectural impact (abstract only),2013,"Despite their many advantages, FPGAs are still inefficient. This inefficiency is mainly due to programmable routing networks; however, FPGA logic blocks also have their share of contribution. From the performance perspective, fewer hops in the routing network translates to a shorter critical path; and that requires large logic blocks capable of covering big portions of circuits. Recent work has shown that And-Inverter Cones (AICs) can considerably reduce the number of logic block levels compared to Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The best performance is achieved when both AICs and LUTs are used, but the AIC implementation requires radical changes in the FPGAs architecture. In this paper, we use AICs as shadow logic for LUTs in LUT-clusters, which requires minimal architectural changes while exploiting the benefits of both AICs and LUTs. The basic idea is to reuse the input crossbar of LUT-clusters for the shadow AICs while combining both LUTs and AICs in the same cluster. We also propose changes in the AIC architecture to enhance mapping on AICs. Our experimental results indicate that the new cluster architecture can reduce the average circuit delay by 12% with respect to standard FPGA clusters. However, this performance gain comes at a price of 43% area overhead in terms of number of logic clusters. Our results show that for a modest 6% increase in area, FPGA manufacturers can move towards next-generation FPGA logic elements. This transition would provide faster design options without major architectural changes."
2053428,15237,8500,A 5.4Gb/s adaptive equalizer using asynchronous-sampling histograms,2011,"As the data rate requirements for many wireline applications increase, channel bandwidth limitation becomes a critical problem in serial interfaces. Equalizers are often used as a solution for this problem. In addition, many applications require the equalizer to be adaptive so that it can provide optimized equalization for different channel conditions. Various types of adaptive equalizers have been investigated for high-speed serial interface applications [1–6]. In the spectrum-balancing method, adaptive equalization is achieved by comparing high and low frequency components of signal power and generating feedback signals until the power spectrum is balanced [1]. Unfortunately, the precision of this scheme is easily affected by process variations, and capacitors both in filters and the feedback loop occupy a large Si area. Digital-signal processing based on maximum likelihood sequence detection can be used for adaptive equalization [2]. But, speed limitation and architecture complexity of ADC limits applicability of this scheme in high-speed applications. In the eye-opening monitoring (EOM) scheme, quality of the signal eye diagram is measured and used for equalizer adaptation [3–6]. For this method, a clock-recovery circuit is needed in order to generate clock signals synchronized to data for sampling. However, it can be difficult to recover clock signals from the initially closed eye diagram, limiting the applicability of this scheme. In this paper, we demonstrate an adaptive equalizer based on asynchronous-sampling histograms."

However, the empirical models presently used in the design stage do not properly represent the electrical and mechanical properties and performance variations of through silicon vias (TSVs) and microbumps (μBumps). What is needed are circuit techniques that handle such uncertainties to enable the creation of robust 3D data links. This paper presents a complete test vehicle for TSV-based wide I/O data communication in a three-tier 3D chip stack assembled in a BGA package. In-place eye-diagram and waveform capturers are mounted in an active silicon interposer to characterize vertical signaling through the chain of TSVs and μBumps."
1180940,15237,8494,Performance analysis of transform in uncoded wireless visual communication,2013,"In wireless scenarios where the channel condition may vary drastically, visual communication systems using source and channel coding generally suffer from threshold effect. An uncoded transmission scheme called SoftCast [1]-[3], however, was recently shown to provide both graceful quality transition and competitive performance. In SoftCast, image signal is directly modulated to a dense constellation using proper power for transmission, solely after employing a transform for energy compaction, leaving out conventional quantization, entropy coding and channel coding. The received signal is lossy in nature, with its noise level commensurate with the channel condition. This paper presents a theoretical analysis for uncoded visual communication, focusing on the role of transform and the quantitative measurement of transform gain in a generalized uncoded transmission framework with optimal power allocation. Our analysis reveal that the energy distribution among signal elements plays an important role in the power-distortion performance. Further analysis show that the energy compaction capability of decorrelation transform can bring significant gain by boosting the energy diversity in signal representation. Numerical analysis results are reported for Markov random signals and natural images, respectively. The performance of typical transforms, e.g. KLT, DCT and DWT, and the effect of different transform sizes or levels are evaluated. These analysis results are verified by simulations."
1247458,15237,8500,21.3 A 2GHz 130mW direct-digital frequency synthesizer with a nonlinear DAC in 55nm CMOS,2014,"Direct-digital frequency synthesizers (DDFSs) have been employed in many frequency-agile communication systems because of their wide bandwidth, fine frequency resolution, and fast frequency-hopping characteristics. Recent developments in DDFSs are towards enhancing performances through reduction of both complexity and power consumption [1-3]. The segmented nonlinear DAC (NLDAC) structures in [1,2] require additional coarse phase information for fine amplitude decoding with a complex decoder. Moreover, the quarter-sine-wave technique incorporated into the segmented NLDACs in [1,2] degrades spectral purity due to the need of the MSB shift DAC that introduces additional offset. Another scheme in [3] reduces complexity and power consumption by replacing the digital-based phase-to-amplitude converter with an analog-based converter, resulting in limited spectral purity. Unlike previous schemes, this work presents comprehensive enhancements in all key areas of a DDFS, the pipelined phase accumulator (PACC), digital decoder, and NLDAC as shown in Fig. 21.3.1. First, the low-power PACC with multi-level momentarily activated bias (M 2 AB) is presented to reduce power dissipation. Second, the coarse phase-based consecutive fine-amplitude grouping (C 2 FAG) scheme reduces the hardware complexity and the power consumption in digital decoder circuits. Third, the mixed-wave conversion topology (MCT) in the NLDAC improves the output spectral purity."
1013836,15237,9772,Keynote speaker: “The roadway to innovation”,2013,"Summary form only given. Electronic innovation is becoming increasingly more important in the evolution of our society. Noble goals of extending healthy lives with improving medical capabilities, creating a cleaner environment, eliminating auto fatalities, and creating a connected infrastructure around the “Internet of Things” all center on electronic innovation. These goals are being driven by both legislation and consumer demand, which is leading to accelerated system challenges driving a strong need for integration of disparate functional blocks and exponential scaling of content. A central focus in this evolution is the automobile. Emission standards are driving systems from single core, simple computational units to highly integrated, scaled out, safe and secure domain controllers, which host multiple diverse software environments. Shifts toward autonomous driving are leading to integrated sensing systems leveraging advanced algorithms for detection classification and safe decision making. The strong demand for connected vehicles is resulting in revolutionary changes to the vehicle network and communication infrastructure embedded in the automobile. We will explore how these automotive trends translate to future challenges for technology platforms, integrated circuit module development, system-on-chip integration, design of safe systems, and implementation of secure but diagnosable systems."
2020100,15237,8500,A 1/13-inch 30fps VGA SoC CMOS image sensor with shared reset and transfer-gate pixel control,2011,"This paper presents a VGA 1/13-inch system-on-chip (SoC), primarily targeted for the consumer camera mobile phone market. In this market low cost, ease of product integration, low module height, and low light image quality are important features. The SoC simplifies integration of the sensor into the final product by providing camera functions such as: automatic exposure control, automatic white balance, flicker detection and avoidance, etc. This reduces cost and saves power since no companion chip is required, and the internal image-processing data rate of the SoC is higher than the output data rate [1], which keeps the interchip communication data rate as low as possible. The small optical format enables a low camera module height. However, the choice of the small optical format also restricts the pixel pitch to 1.75μm, which influences both image quality and die size. The low light image quality, in this sensor, is improved by incorporating a 1.75μm pixel architecture, and the size of the sensor core is greatly reduced by removing the dark pixel reference rows and columns, using a single side dual bank of double-pitch sampling capacitors, a class-AB programmable-gain amplifier (PGA), followed by an inter-stage shared pipeline ADC."
778380,15237,23907,SURFEX: A 57fps 1080P resolution 220mW silicon implementation for simplified speeded-up robust feature with 65nm process,2013,"Speeded Up Robust Feature(SURF) is widely used in computer vision applications. In many recent applications like mobile devices and vision sensor network, it is extremely difficult to meet both the performance and power consumption requirements of SURF implementations, especially for CPU, GPU, DSP or FPGA based solutions. In this paper, the SURF algorithm is simplified and optimized for hardware implementation. To increase the throughput, procedures like orientation assignment and descriptor extraction are re-organized while maintaining enough accuracy; the memory accesses have also been improved to increase the bandwidth and reduce repeated data accesses; the workload of each stage in the pipeline is analyzed and balanced to reduce the pipeline bubble. Furthermore, a method called Word Length Reduction (WLR) is adopted to compress the integral image, which reduces the on-chip memory by 40%. In addition to that, the corresponding power consumptions are reduced significantly. The Simplified SURF is implemented onto a 3.4×4.0 mm 2  chip called SURFEX using TSMC 65nm process. The chip is able to process 57 frames of 1080p(1920×1080) video per second with a 200MHz working frequency while dissipating 220mW. This throughput is 6 times of the ones reported in the latest literatures and the power consumption is less than half of the most outstanding implementations."
1198591,15237,23593,Efficient system-level mapping from streaming applications to FPGAs (abstract only),2013,"Streaming processing is an important computation model that represents many applications in various domains such as video processing, signal processing and wireless communication. FPGA is a natural platform for streaming applications because the task-level pipelined parallelism can be efficiently implemented on FPGA by its customizable communication and memory architecture. In this paper we propose an efficient design space exploration algorithm to map kernels of streaming applications onto FPGAs. We aim at finding the most area-efficient selections of hardware modules from the implementation library while satisfying the system performance requirement. In particular, we consider both module selection and replication techniques. Design metrics are formulated in our high-level model based on these two techniques. In addition, we extend the analytic formulations in previous work by supporting complex stream graph structures like feedback loops. The proposed iterative exploration algorithm is based on the system of difference constraint (SDC) and thus can be solved in polynomial time. Compared to previous mainstream ILP-based solutions, our proposed algorithm is scalable and practical in large systems. Both the ILP formulation and our proposed iterative exploration mechanism are applied to a set of streaming applications from StreamIt benchmarks and also to one real example MPEG-4 decoder. Experiments demonstrate that our design space exploration algorithm can efficiently find a feasible solution with an average 5.7% area overhead."
2141199,15237,8500,A switched-capacitor power amplifier for EER/polar transmitters,2011,"Wireless high-speed communication standards such as WiFi, WiMax and LTE use spectrally-efficient OFDM modulation that encodes signal information in both amplitude and phase. Use of this non-constant envelope modulation requires a linear PA, operating at a less-than-peak signal level to realize higher linearity and inherently reduced efficiency. Because the PA is the dominant power consumer in most RF transceivers, operation with reduced efficiency leads to short battery lifetime and reduced mobility. Consequently, many efforts to utilize more efficient switching amplifiers with linearization circuitry have been made, notably through pulse-width modulation [1], outphasing [2] and envelope elimination and restoration (EER) [3,4]. Of the three, EER offers the best performance tradeoff between linearity, output power and efficiency; however, most previous implementations have come at the cost of large, power-hungry analog supply modulators. Additionally, conventional EER techniques are subject to nonlinearity induced by delay mismatch between the amplitude- and phase-modulated signal components. An alternative solution modulated the output power by selecting multiple PA unit cells [5], but this exhibits low efficiency at low output power levels because the power control is achieved by changing the total PA transconductance through switching of inefficient cells."
1678562,15237,8494,High-efficient hardware design based on enhanced Tschirnhaus transform for solving the LSPs,2013,"This work presents a novel hardware design based on the enhanced Tschirnhaus transform (ETT) to solve the 8-order line spectral pairs (LSPs). To reduce high-complexity problems caused by fractional multiplication, the ETT is proposed to replace such operations with integer-based shift and addition operations of the original Tschirnhaus transform. Also, the data dependency graph (DDG) of the ETT is analyzed for designing hardware units and reducing computation cycles. The proposed hardware has two key blocks: the mixture computation unit (MCU) and the multiplier-free pipelined square-root unit (PSRU). The first block is designed to fast calculate multiplication and summation operations in the ETT with the use of a two-stage pipeline architecture. The second is developed to speed up square-root operations after 8-order LSPs are decomposed into two 4-order LSPs. It can also timely process the result of the first block within limited cycles. The experimental results show that compared with the Chebyshev-based research, the proposed hardware can reduce the cycle times by 98.1% and also saved about 49.7% of gate counts. In the precision evaluation, the result indicates that 95% of the computation errors are within 0.02 and proves that the proposed hardware is capable of quantizing LSPs almost as accurately as computers do. Such results reveal that the proposed work is superior to the other Chebyshev-based methods, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed design."
2239517,15237,8500,An offset-tolerant current-sampling-based sense amplifier for Sub-100nA-cell-current nonvolatile memory,2011,"Decreasing read cell current (I CELL ) has become a key trend in nonvolatile memory (NVM). This is not only due to device size and V DD  scaling while keeping the same threshold voltage (V TH ), but also to the growing spread of the following applications: 1) multiple-level-cell (MLC) [1–2] to achieve smaller area-per-bit; 2) lower-V DD  [3] to save power consumption; 3) Logic-process-compatible onetime programming memories (OTP) for embedding into mobile chips. A smaller I CELL  leaves the sense amplifiers (SAs) operation vulnerable to 1) bitline (BL) level offset due to noise, bias and load (C BL ) mismatches and 2) V TH  variation. As device size and BL-pitch is continually scaled down, the above factors have become major showstopper for SAs. To tolerate these offsets, small-I CELL NVMs suffer from slow read speed or high read fail probability. Thus, a more largely offset tolerant SA is a prerequisite to achieve faster read speeds. In this study, we propose a new offset tolerant current-sampling-based SA (CSB-SA) to achieve 7× faster read speed than previous SAs for sensing small I CELL . A fabricated 90nm 512Kb OTP macro, using the CSB-SA and our CMOS-logic-compatible OTP cell [4], achieves 26ns macro random access time for reading sub-200nA I CELL . Measurements also confirmed that this 90nm CSB-SA could achieve sub-100nA sensing."
2429600,15237,8500,An injection-locked ring PLL with self-aligned injection window,2011,"In modern analog front-ends, there is an increasing demand on high-performance analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), which require high sampling frequency and low-jitter sampling clock. This makes low-jitter phase-locked loops (PLLs) with jitter on the order of few picoseconds desirable. Unfortunately, due to stringent limit on die area, sometimes a PLL with a ring oscillator is the only choice. To get better phase noise, a wider loop bandwidth is needed to suppress the noise of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). However, due to the discrete-time nature of the operations, the loop bandwidth is limited to one-tenth of the crystal oscillator (XTAL) frequency. One way to solve this problem is to use the injection-locking technique. This method exploits the clean reference clock but has several production problems. One is the frequency offset between injection signal and VCO, and this can be solved by using the injection-locked PLL architecture [1, 2]. However, in [1, 2] extra loops are still needed to adjust the injection window due to on-chip variations. In this work, an injection-locked ring PLL (ILRPLL) architecture is proposed to solve this problem. Using the concept of sub-sampling PLLs [3], the injection window is aligned automatically without feedback adjustment. A 432MHz ILRPLL is realized in ATV/DTV system to justify this technique."

Existing HLS tools support a wide variety of input languages, and assist users in design space exploration through automation and feedback on designs' performance bottlenecks. This design space exploration applies techniques such as pipelining, partitioning and resource sharing in order to improve performance, and resource utilization. However, although automated exploration can find some inherent parallelism, data-parallel input source code is still superior for exposing a greater variety of parallelism. In prior work, we demonstrated automated design space exploration of GPU multi-threaded (CUDA) language source code for efficient RTL generation. In this paper, we examine the challenges in extending this automated design space exploration to multiple dependent CUDA kernels, demonstrate a step-by-step procedure for efficiently performing multi-kernel synthesis, and demonstrate the potential of this approach through a case study of a stereo matching algorithm. This study demonstrates that HLS of multiple dependent CUDA kernels can maintain performance parity with the GPU implementation, while consuming over 16X less energy than the GPU. Based on our manual procedure, we identify the key challenges in fully automating the synthesis of multi-kernel CUDA programs."

Realizing this requires abandoning the traditional keyboard/screen user interface to make the electronic devices autonomous, independent from a human in the loop, and to provide its services hidden in the background.   In this paper, I will first explain why in the background operating electronics recently became feasible in the form of autonomous wireless sensor nodes. Next, I will present a technology roadmap, ranging from sensors measuring physical phenomena, via environmental sensors that combine physical with chemical monitoring, to ultimately emotional sensors that provide instantaneous and objective information about one's emotions.

1777719,15237,8500,3D volumetric ultrasound imaging with a 32×32 CMUT array integrated with front-end ICs using flip-chip bonding technology,2013,"3D ultrasound imaging is becoming increasingly prevalent in the medical field. Compared to conventional 2D imaging systems, 3D imaging can provide a detailed view of tissue structures that makes diagnosis easier for the physicians. In addition, 2D image slices can be formed at various orientations to the transducer, making the examination less dependent on the skill of the sonographer. However, various challenges exist in developing a 3D imaging system, such as integration of a large number of elements, as well as post-processing of datasets received from a large number of channels. 2D transducer arrays are typically integrated with custom ICs in the probe handle to perform some intermediate beamforming and to reduce the number of cable connections to the imaging system. Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have emerged as an alternative to piezoelectric transducers. Being a MEMS device, they greatly benefit from flexibility and ease of fabrication, and can be seamlessly integrated with electronics. Previous work demonstrates 3D stacking of CMUTs and dummy ICs with an intermediate interposer layer. However, that represents more of a mechanical demonstration of 3D integration. In this paper, we present a fully functional 3D ultrasound imaging system comprising a 32×32 2D CMUT array, 3D-stacked with front-end ICs using flip-chip bonding technology. The imaging system is capable of capturing real-time volumetric ultrasound data, and displaying 2D and 3D ultrasound images."
1064617,15237,23593,FPGA LUT design for wide-band dynamic voltage and frequency scaled operation (abstract only),2014,"Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are the implementation platform of choice when it comes to design flexibility. However, the high power consumption of FPGAs (which arises due to their flexible structure), make them less appealing for extreme low power applications. In this paper, we present a design of an FPGA look-up table (LUT), with the goal of seamless operation over a wide band of supply voltages. The same LUT design has the ability to operate at sub-threshold voltage when low power is required, and at higher voltages whenever faster performance is required. The results show that operating the LUT in sub-threshold mode yields a (~80x) lower power and (~4x) lower energy than full supply voltage operation, for a 6-input LUT implemented in a 22nm predictive technology. The key drawback of sub-threshold operation is its susceptibility to process, temperature, and supply voltage (PVT) variations. This paper also presents the design and experimental results for a closed-loop adaptive body biasing mechanism to dynamically cancel these PVT variations. For the same 22nm technology, we demonstrate that the closed-loop adaptive body biasing circuits can allow the FPGA to operate over an operating frequency range that spans an order of magnitude (40 MHz to 1300 MHz). We also show that the closed-loop adaptive body biasing circuits can cancel delay variations due to supply voltage changes, and reduce the effect of process variations on setup and hold times by 1.8x and 2.9x respectively."
1726504,15237,11330,Design of a large-scale storage-class RRAM system,2013,"Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) is a promising next generation non-volatile memory (NVM) technology, thanks to its performance potential, endurance and ease-of-integration with standard silicon CMOS processes. While prior work has evaluated RRAM as a replacement for DRAM or even cache memory, to our knowledge there is no prior study that has investigated whether RRAM could be a viable NAND flash replacement in building large-scale storage-class memory systems. Motivated by this observation, our paper first discusses and quantifies the main problems associated with RRAM that prevent it from replacing NAND flash. The main solution we propose, slab-based memory access with local/global bitlines, enables dense RRAM islands but can also cause performance related problems. To compensate for the latter, we also propose exploiting internal resource parallelism in RRAM and employing optimized data movement interfaces. Our extensive experimental evaluation using a cycle-level NVM simulator and real workloads under diverse computing domains indicate that the proposed architecture can provide 2.95 ~ 8.28 times better bandwidth and 66% ~ 88% shorter latency as compared to the conventional NAND flash, and improve the system-level performance of our workloads by 5x, with a storage capacity similar to that of the state-of-the-art NAND flash."
850489,15237,8500,A 36mW/9mW power-scalable DCO in 55nm CMOS for GSM/WCDMA frequency synthesizers,2012,"The RF front-ends of modern smart phones are becoming more complicated as newer standards are introduced (e.g. LTE). Reconfigurability can be used to reduce their size, provided that power consumption is not adversely affected. For 2G/3G transceivers, local oscillator (LO) generation requires significant area and power. Reconfigurable voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) are generally used to maximize the achievable tuning range to reduce their number in the presence of many supported bands. However, no VCO capable to support both WCDMA and GSM has been reported that is also competitive with the power consumption achieved using two separate oscillators. In fact, the very demanding GSM phase-noise specs require a current up to four times higher (depending on the duplexer selectivity) than that used in the WCDMA case. In the design of an LC-tank harmonic oscillator, phase noise normalized to power consumption (i.e. the figure-of-merit, FOM), reaches an optimum at the maximum oscillation amplitude compatible with the supply voltage V dd  [1]. This condition impairs the power reconfigurability of a VCO, since there is only one value of bias current yielding the highest FOM, once tank and V dd  are chosen. On the other hand, making the tank reconfigurable invariably results in a degradation of its Q, i.e. a reduced FOM."
849264,15237,8500,A pattern-guided adaptive equalizer in 65nm CMOS,2011,"The use of adaptive equalizers at the front end of receivers is becoming a necessity as the data rates increase without channel improvements. Adaptive equalizers can be implemented using data-aided or non-data-aided schemes [1], with the latter requiring less area and power. Previous non-data-aided adaptive schemes [2–3] implement an asynchronous analog algorithm where the power spectrum of the received signal is checked for balance around a threshold frequency. Similarly, [4] proposes a digital adaptive algorithm which is based on the detection of specific 5-bit patterns. In all three works [2–4], however, adaptation is provided only for equalizers with a single coefficient, which are suitable for well-behaved channels. In contrast, this paper presents a digital adaptive engine for an equalizer with two coefficients: one adjusting the equalizer gain at the Nyquist frequency (f N ) and one at f N /2. Furthermore, the proposed engine is asynchronous; it can function when driven by a blind clock at the receiver. This is useful as it allows the adaptation process to start even when the CDR has not yet achieved lock. This also avoids a deadlock situation where the CDR and equalizer require simultaneous access to the equalized data and the recovered clock. Our measured results of the proposed adaptive equalizer in 65nm CMOS confirm that the adaptation converges to within 2.6% of the optimal vertical eye opening in less than 400μs for two different channels at a data rate of 6Gb/s with a 25,000ppm frequency offset."
2043337,15237,20649,Checking architectural outputs instruction-by-instruction on acceleration platforms,2012,"Simulation-based verification is an integral part of a modern microprocessor's design effort. Commonly, several checking techniques are deployed alongside the simulator to detect and localize each functional bug manifestation. Among these, a widespread technique entails comparing a microprocessor design's outputs with a golden model at the architectural granularity, instruction-by-instruction. However, due to exponential growth in design complexity, the performance of software-based simulation falls far short of achieving an acceptable level of coverage, which typically requires billions of simulation cycles. Hence, verification engineers rely on simulation acceleration platforms. Unfortunately, the intrinsic characteristics of these platforms make the adoption of the checking solutions mentioned above a challenging goal: for instance, the lockstep execution of a software checker together with the design's simulation is no longer feasible.   To address this challenge we propose an innovative solution for instruction-by-instruction (IBI) checking tailored to acceleration platforms. We provide novel design techniques to decouple event tracing from checking by including specialized tracing logic and by adding a post-simulation checking phase. Note that simulation performance in acceleration platforms degrades when increasing the number of signals that are traced; hence, it is imperative to generate a compact summary of the information required for checking, collecting and tracing only a few bits of information per cycle."

However, conventional NVMs cannot achieve low-V DD  operation due to insufficient write voltage generated by charge-pumped (CP) circuits at a low V DD , and a lack of low-V DD  current-mode sense amplifiers (CSA) [1–4] to overcome read issues in reduced sensing margins, degraded speeds, and insufficient voltage headroom (VHR). Resistive RAM (ReRAM) [4–6] is a promising memory with the advantages of short write time, low write-voltage, and reduced write power compared to Flash and other NVMs. Using a low-V DD  CP with relaxed output voltage/current requirements for write operations, ReRAM is a good candidate for on-chip low-V DD  NVM if a low-V DD  CSA is provided, particularly for frequent-read-seldom-write applications.

The HEVC reference decoder HM 3.1 is profiled with Intel VTune on Intel Core 2 Duo processor. The analysis covers both Low Complexity (LC) and High Efficiency (HE) settings for resolutions varying from WQVGA (416 × 240 pixels) up to 1600p (2560 × 1600 pixels). The yielded cycle-accurate results are compared with the respective results of H.264/AVC Baseline Profile (BP) and High Profile (HiP) reference decoders. HEVC offers significant improvement in compression efficiency over H.264/AVC: the average BD-rate saving of LC is around 51% over BP whereas the BD-rate gain of HE is around 45% over HiP. However, the average decoding complexities of LC and HE are increased by 61% and 87% over BP and HiP, respectively. In LC, the most complex functions are motion compensation (MC) and loop filtering (LF) that account on average for 50% and 14% of the decoder complexity. The decoding complexity of HE configuration is on average 42% higher than that of the LC configuration. Majority of the difference is caused by extra LF stages. In HE, the complexities of MC and LF are 37% and 32%, respectively. In practice, a standard 3 GHz dual core processor is expected to be able to decode 1080p HEVC content in real-time."

The two main advantages of the system, compared to existing wearable systems are from the application's point of view: (a) the stationary installation has a better acceptance for independent living comparing to permanent wearing devices, and (b) the privacy of the system is systematically ensured since the vision detector does not produce real images such as classic video sensors. The system can actually process about 300 kevents per second. It was evaluated using 500 fall cases acquired with a stuntman. More than 90% positive detections were reported.

I. Introduction A magnetic Hall sensor is a transducer, which converts a magnetic field into a corresponding electrical signal. Magnetic Hall micro-sensors generally use integrated Hall plates as sensing devices, which are fully compatible with standard CMOS technologies. Hall e ect sensors are widely used for proximity switching, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications. Typically, Hall plates are used in voltage-mode and for many years voltage-mode Hall sensors have been absolutely dominant in most of the applications. This means that the mag- netic field to be measured is converted into an output voltage. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and o set are important features in Hall sensors performance evaluation. Several techniques have been developed in order to improve these characteristics. Most of them, (1)-(5), are based on conventional voltage-mode Hall transducers. Parasitic capacitances and their e ect, specially at high frequency operation, a ect performance of voltage-mode solutions. As an alternative solution, an Hall sensor can work in the current mode. The output is current and not voltage. In the current-mode Hall sensors there is no variation of the terminal potentials and so no influence of the parasitic capacitances. Also, it can be possible to use of smaller number of terminals, therefore the ultimate miniaturization of the device is easier, (1). This paper presents a low power current-mode Hall sensor microsystem with di erential output current, as shown in Fig. 1. The physical structure of the proposed current-mode Hall sensor is the same of modern devices, with the same possibility of compensating for the o set caused by mismatch (current spinning). The di erence is in driving and extracting the signal.

Visionary applications such as brain-computer interfaces sound like magic! However, with every new generation of technology and application algorithms, wearable wireless systems become less obtrusive, higher performing, and more autonomous. The envisaged large-scale deployment of wearable healthcare and lifestyle add-ons that can monitor systemic factors such as stress and emotions, will revolutionize how we live, play, and work. But, none of these developments is heralding a “Brave New World” instead, they will foster and strengthen the role and impact of each individual along the path to a longer, healthier and happier life."
1655724,15237,9836,Costs and benefits of flexibility in spatial division circuit switched networks-on-chip,2013,"Although most Network-on-Chip (NoC) designs are based on Packet Switching (PS), the importance of Circuit Switching (CS) should not be underestimated. Many MPSoC executing real-time applications require an underlying communication backbone that can relay messages from one node to another with guaranteed throughput. Compared to PS, CS can provide guaranteed throughput with lower area and power overheads. It is also highly suited for applications where nodes transfer long messages. Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM) can allow more efficient use of available network resources by dividing them among multiple simultaneous transactions. The network developed by Vali [1] has three design variations based on the number of sub-channels, has a predictable connection setup time, and uses CS to provide guaranteed throughput once a connection is established. In this paper we use this network as a basis to study the effect of flexibility based on SDM, on the performance of a CS networks. A network evaluation platform has been developed to configure and evaluate networks with a maximum of 8 sub-networks, with each subnetwork comprising of 1, 2 or 4 sub-channels. We show that under uniform traffic pattern with requests of uniform random bandwidth (BW) requirement, a less flexible network outperforms a network with higher flexibility due to a phenomenon we call 'stray requests'. We conclude this paper by showing that under high network traffic, performance of our flexible networks can be as much as 113% better than HAGAR [2] and Liu's [3] network."
1339442,15237,23593,Accelerating massive short reads mapping for next generation sequencing (abstract only),2014,"Due to the explosion of gene sequencing data with over one billion reads per run, the data-intensive computations of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) applications pose great challenges to current computing capability. In this paper we investigate both algorithmic and architectural accelerating strategies to a typical NGS analysis algorithm -- short reads mapping -- on a commodity multicore and customizable FPGA coprocessor architecture, respectively. First, we propose a hash buckets reorder algorithm that increases shared cache parallelism during the course of searching hash index. The algorithmic strategy achieves 122Gbp/day throughput by exploiting shared-cache parallelism, that leads to performance improvement of 2 times on an 8-core Intel Xeon processor. Second, we develop a FPGA coprocessor that leverages both bit-level and word-level parallelism with scatter-gather memory mechanism to speedup inherent irregular memory access operations by increasing effective memory bandwidth. Our customized FPGA coprocessor achieves 947Gbp per day throughput, that is 189 times higher than current mapping tools on single CPU core, and above 2 times higher than a 64-core multi-processor system. The coprocessor's power efficiency is 29 times higher than a conventional 64-core multi-processor. The results indicate that the customized FPGA coprocessor architecture, that is configured with scatter-gather memory's word-level access, appeals to data intensive applications."
1941286,15237,20649,Role of power grid in side channel attack and power-grid-aware secure design,2013,"Side-channel attack (SCA) is a method in which an attacker aims at extracting secret information from crypto chips by analyzing physical parameters (e.g. power). SCA has emerged as a serious threat to many mathematically unbreakable cryptography systems. From an attacker's point of view, the difficulty of mounting SCA largely depends on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the side-channel information. It has been shown that SNR primarily depends on algorithmic and circuit-level implementation, measurement noise, as well as device thermal noise. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any study on the effect of power delivery network (PDN) on SCA resistance. We note that the PDN plays a significant role in SNR of measured supply current. Furthermore, SCA resistance strongly depends on the operating frequency due to RLC structure of a power grid. In this paper, we analyze the effect of power grid on SCA and provide quantitative results to demonstrate the frequency-dependent SCA resistance due to PDN-induced noise. This property can potentially be exploited by an attacker to facilitate the attack by operating a device at favorable frequency points. On the other hand, from a designer's perspective, one can explore countermeasures to secure the device at all operating frequencies while minimizing the design overhead. Based on this observation, we propose a frequency-dependent noise-injection based compensation technique to efficiently protect against SCA. Simulation results using realistic PDN model as well as experimental measurements using FPGA test board validate the observations on role of PDN in SCA and the efficacy of the proposed compensation approach."
1493894,15237,9836,Quality programmable vector processors for approximate computing,2013,"Approximate computing leverages the intrinsic resilience of applications to inexactness in their computations, to achieve a desirable trade-off between efficiency (performance or energy) and acceptable quality of results. To broaden the applicability of approximate computing, we propose quality programmable processors, in which the notion of quality is explicitly codified in the HW/SW interface, i.e., the instruction set. The ISA of a quality programmable processor contains instructions associated with quality fields to specify the accuracy level that must be met during their execution. We show that this ability to control the accuracy of instruction execution greatly enhances the scope of approximate computing, allowing it to be applied to larger parts of programs. The micro-architecture of a quality programmable processor contains hardware mechanisms that translate the instruction-level quality specifications into energy savings. Additionally, it may expose the actual error incurred during the execution of each instruction (which may be less than the specified limit) back to software. As a first embodiment of quality programmable processors, we present the design of Quora, an energy efficient, quality programmable vector processor. Quora utilizes a 3-tiered hierarchy of processing elements that provide distinctly different energy vs. quality trade-offs, and uses hardware mechanisms based on precision scaling with error monitoring and compensation to facilitate quality programmable execution. We evaluate an implementation of Quora with 289 processing elements in 45nm technology. The results demonstrate that leveraging quality-programmability leads to 1.05×–1.7× savings in energy for virtually no loss (< 0.5%) in application output quality, and 1.18×–2.1× energy savings for modest impact (<2.5%) on output quality. Our work suggests that quality programmable processors are a significant step towards bringing approximate computing to the mainstream."
1809543,15237,8500,A flip-chip-packaged 1.8V 28dBm class-AB power amplifier with shielded concentric transformers in 32nm SoC CMOS,2011,"As CMOS technology continues to scale for SoC applications, significant challenges to implement a monolithic linear high-power amplifier have emerged. This results from the low breakdown voltage of transistors, high on-chip passive loss on a conductive substrate, stringent bump-pattern constraints and thermal dissipation requirements of flip-chip packages. Most fully-integrated linear CMOS PAs reported to date were either fabricated on a relatively mature process (65nm or above) in a wire-bonded die with relatively high supply voltage (3.3V) [1–3], or exhibited low power efficiency when backed-off. In many cases, digital pre-distortion was implemented to improve linearity and efficiency [2,3]. We present a 1.8V single-chip CMOS PA with 21dBm average output power and 16% PAE while meeting −25dB EVM for 64-QAM OFDM signal without digital pre-distortion linearization in 32nm SoC CMOS on a flip-chip package. This performance is enabled by: 1) On-chip shielded concentric transformers with power-splitting/combining structures to fit the design within the bump pattern constraint and thermal dissipation requirement of an SoC flip-chip package and to enhance power handling capability; 2) Minimum phase distortion by optimized inter-stage power matching allowed by the high f max  of the minimum-channel-length device."
1028085,15237,23593,A scalable sparse matrix-vector multiplication kernel for energy-efficient sparse-blas on FPGAs,2014,"Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMxV) is a widely used mathematical operation in many high-performance scientific and engineering applications. In recent years, tuned software libraries for multi-core microprocessors (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the status quo for computing SpMxV. However, the computational throughput of these libraries for sparse matrices tends to be significantly lower than that of dense matrices, mostly due to the fact that the compression formats required to efficiently store sparse matrices mismatches traditional computing architectures. This paper describes an FPGA-based SpMxV kernel that is scalable to efficiently utilize the available memory bandwidth and computing resources. Benchmarking on a Virtex-5 SX95T FPGA demonstrates an average computational efficiency of 91.85%. The kernel achieves a peak computational efficiency of 99.8%, a >50x improvement over two Intel Core i7 processors (i7-2600 and i7-4770) and showing a >300x improvement over two NVIDA GPUs (GTX 660 and GTX Titan), when running the MKL and cuSPARSE sparse-BLAS libraries, respectively. In addition, the SpMxV FPGA kernel is able to achieve higher performance than its CPU and GPU counterparts, while using only 64 single-precision processing elements, with an overall 38-50x improvement in energy efficiency."
870493,15237,23836,A Replacement Technique to Maximize Task Reuse in Reconfigurable Systems,2011,"Dynamically reconfigurable hardware is a promising technology that combines in the same device both the high performance and the flexibility that many recent applications demand. However, one of its main drawbacks is the reconfiguration overhead, which involves important delays in the task execution, usually in the order of hundreds of milliseconds, as well as high energy consumption. One of the most powerful ways to tackle this problem is configuration reuse, since reusing a task does not involve any reconfiguration overhead. In this paper we propose a configuration replacement policy for reconfigurable systems that maximizes task reuse in highly dynamic environments. We have integrated this policy in an external task-graph execution manager that applies task prefetch by loading and executing the tasks as soon as possible (ASAP). However, we have also modified this ASAP technique in order to make the replacements more flexible, by taking into account the mobility of the tasks and delaying some of the reconfigurations. In addition, this replacement policy is a hybrid design-time/run-time approach, which performs the bulk of the computations at design time in order to save run-time computations. Our results illustrate that the proposed strategy outperforms other state-of- the-art replacement policies in terms of reuse rates and achieves near-optimal reconfiguration overhead reductions. In addition, by performing the bulk of the computations at design time, we reduce the execution time of the replacement technique by 10 times with respect to an equivalent purely run-time one."
2139094,15237,23593,Rethinking FPGAs: elude the flexibility excess of LUTs with and-inverter cones,2012,"Look-Up Tables (LUTs)  are universally used in FPGAs as the elementary logic blocks. They can implement any logic function and thus covering a circuit is a relatively straightforward problem. Naturally, flexibility comes at a price, and increasing the number of LUT inputs to cover larger parts of a circuit has an exponential cost in the LUT complexity. Hence, rarely LUTs with more than 4-6 inputs have been used. In this paper we argue that other elementary logic blocks can provide a better compromise between hardware complexity, flexibility, delay, and input and output counts. Inspired by recent trends in synthesis and verification, we explore blocks based on  And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs):  they have a complexity which is only linear in the number of inputs, they sport the potential for multiple independent outputs, and the delay is only logarithmic in the number of inputs. Of course, these new blocks are extremely less flexible than LUTs; yet, we show (i) that effective mapping algorithms exist, (ii) that, due to their simplicity, poor utilization is less of an issue than with LUTs, and (iii) that a few LUTs can still be used in extreme unfortunate cases. We show first results indicating that this new logic block  combined  to some LUTs in hybrid FPGAs can reduce delay up to 22-32% and area by some 16% on average. Yet, we explored only a few design points and we think that these results could still be improved by a more systematic exploration."
2026312,15237,8335,Variation-tolerant and self-repair design methodology for low temperature polycrystalline silicon liquid crystal and organic light emitting diode displays,2011,"In low temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) based display technologies, the electrical parameter variations in thin film transistors (TFTs) caused by random grain boundaries (GBs) result in significant yield loss, thereby impeding its wide deployment. In this paper, from a system and circuit design perspective, we propose a new self-repair design methodology to compensate the GB-induced variations for LTPS liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and active-matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) displays. The key idea is to extend the charging time for detected low drivability pixel switches, hence, suppressing the brightness non-uniformity and eliminating the need for large voltage margins. The proposed circuit was implemented in VGA LCD panels which were used for prediction of power consumption and yield. Based on the simulation results, the proposed circuit decreases the required supply voltage by 20% without performance and yield degradation. 7% yield enhancement is observed for high resolution, large sized LCDs while incurring negligible power penalty. This technique enables LTPS-based displays either to further scale down the device size for higher integration and lower power consumption or to have superior yield in large sized panels with small power overhead."
1720557,15237,23593,MPack: global memory optimization for stream applications in high-level synthesis,2014,"One of the challenges in designing high-performance FPGA applications is fine-tuning the use of limited on-chip memory storage among many buffers in an application. To achieve desired performance the designer faces the burden of packaging such buffers into on-chip memories and manually optimizing the utilization of each memory and the throughput of each buffer. In addition, the application memories may not match the word width or depth of the physical on-chip memories available on the FPGA. This process is time consuming and non-trivial, particularly with a large number of buffers of various depths and bit widths. We propose a tool, MPack, which globally optimizes on-chip memory use across all buffers for stream applications. The goal is to speed up development time by providing rapid design space exploration and relieving the designer of lengthy low-level iterations. We introduce new high-level pragmas allowing the user to specify global memory requirements, such as an application's on-chip memory budget and data throughput. We allow the user to quickly generate a large number of memory solutions and explore the trade-off between memory usage and achievable throughput. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool, we apply the new  high-level  pragmas to an image processing benchmark. MPack effectively explores the design space and is able to produce a large number of memory solutions ranging from 10 to 100% in throughput, and from 12 to 100% in on-chip memory usage."
2196534,15237,23907,A new CMOS image sensor readout structure for 3D integrated imagers,2011,"This paper presents a new CMOS image sensor (CIS) structure and ADC design for three-dimensional (3D) integrated imagers. A modular design of CIS sub-array is proposed with new readout and control scheme. It needs only one micro-bump (µbump) per sub-array, instead of per-pixel or per-column, to release the design rule restriction of the 3D stacking process. The proposed readout structure with in-pixel two-dimensional decoding function achieves a high spatial resolution without degrading the frame rate performance. A 10b time-interleaved asynchronous successive approximation register (SAR) ADC was also implemented within 300µmx150µm for array readout. A prototype chip with four sub-arrays (4×192×128 pixels) and a pixel size of 2.8×2.8 um 2  was fabricated using TSMC 0.18um CIS process. The experimental results demonstrate the parallel output images of 4 modules successfully with 100fps. It shows that the array is expandable by modular sub-array design and is expected to achieve 100fps at multi-mega imaging for high-speed HDTV camera applications. The measured DNL, INL, and power consumption of the SAR ADC are +0.59/−0.41 LSB, +1.32/−0.73 LSB, and 130 µW respectively."
1206542,15237,9836,Accurate Fine-Grained Processor Power Proxies,2012,"There are not yet practical and accurate ways to directly measure core power in a microprocessor. This limits the granularity of measurement and control for computer power management. We overcome this limitation by presenting an accurate runtime per-core power proxy which closely estimates true core power. This enables new fine-grained microprocessor power management techniques at the core level. For example, cloud environments could manage and bill virtual machines for energy consumption associated with the core. The power model underlying our power proxy also enables energy-efficiency controllers to perform what-if analysis, instead of merely reacting to current conditions. We develop and validate a methodology for accurate power proxy training at both chip and core levels. Our implementation of power proxies uses on-chip logic in a high-performance multi-core processor and associated platform firmware. The power proxies account for full voltage and frequency ranges, as well as chip-to-chip process variations. For fixed clock frequency operation, a mean unsigned error of 1.8% for fine-grained 32ms samples across all workloads was achieved. For an interval of an entire workload, we achieve an average error of-0.2%. Similar results were achieved for voltage-scaling scenarios, too. We also present two sample applications of the power proxy: (1) per-core power billing for cloud computing services, and (2) simultaneous runtime energy saving comparisons among different power management policies without running each policy separately."
1521414,15237,23593,Using many-core architectural templates for FPGA-based computing (abstract only),2011,"Truly unleashing the computing potential of FPGAs, as well as widening their applicability, demands alleviating cumbersome HDL programming and relieving laborious manual optimization. Towards this end, we propose a  Many-core Approach to Reconfigurable Computing  (MARC) that enables efficient high-performance computing for applications expressed with imperative programming languages such as C/C++ without constructing FPGA computing machines from scratch when targeting various applications within the same or similar problem domains. A MARC system achieves high computing performance by leveraging a many-core architectural template, sophisticated logic synthesizing techniques, and state-of-art compiler optimization technology. In addition, MARC exploits abundant special FPGA resources such as distributed block memories and DSP blocks to implement complete single-chip high efficiency many-core microarchitectures. The key benefits of MARC include (i) allowing programmers to easily express parallelism through a high-level programming language, (ii) supporting coarse-grain multithreading and dataflow-style fine-grain threading while permitting bit-level resource control, and (iii) greatly reducing the effort required to re-purpose the hardware system for different algorithms or different applications."
2222303,15237,8500,A 4.8Gb/s impedance-matched bidirectional multi-drop transceiver for high-capacity memory interface,2011,"With the scaling of CMOS transistors and advance in I/O circuitry, the data rate of memory interfaces has recently reached 16Gb/s per channel [1], in which a point-to-point channel is required rather than a multi-drop channel for the high data rate. While point-to-point channels are advantageous in achieving higher data rates because of the absence of undesired reflections that occur at each stub of multi-drop channels, they are not suitable for high-capacity, high-throughput memory systems such as transaction servers or cloud computing nodes due to their prohibitively large PCB routing area connecting the memory chips. FBDIMM [2] and the cascading memory architecture [3] aim to reduce the routing area by the use of daisy-chained configurations, but they suffer from increased latency problems. This is why the recent DDR2/3 memory interface still uses the multi-drop bus architecture called stub series terminated logic (SSTL), and a number of proposals have been made to mitigate the problem of stub reflections in SSTL. For instance, a decision feedback equalizer has been used [4] to cancel the inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to stub reflections; but this requires a large number of filter taps, resulting in a limited speed under 3Gb/s. Another approach to eliminate impedance discontinuity is to use a 2Z 0  ohm transmission line [5], but this scheme is only applicable to 2-slot configurations."
1170096,15237,20649,21st century digital design tools,2013,"Most chips today are designed with 20th century CAD tools. These tools, and the abstractions they are based on, were originally intended to handle designs of millions of gates or less. They are not up to the task of handling today's billion-gate designs. The result is months of delay and considerable labor from final RTL to tapeout. Surprises in timing closure, global congestion, and power consumption are common. Even taking an existing design to a new process node is a time-consuming and laborious process.   Twenty-first century CAD tools should be based on higher-level abstractions to enable billion-gate chips to go from final RTL to tapeout in days, not months. Key to attaining this increase in productivity is raising the level of design and using simple, standard interfaces. Designs should be composed from high-level modules -- processors, MODEMs, CODECs, memory subsystems, and I/O subsystems -- rather than gates and flip-flops. Each module, which we expect to contain 100 thousand to 10 million gates, is easily laid out by today's tools, is placed as a unit, and communicates over a NoC via a standard interface. Restricting modules to standard sizes and aspect ratios further simplifies physical design. We expect even a large chip to contain at most a few thousand such modules and expect the physical design and chip-assembly to take a few days with minimal labor after completion of the module-level design."
1754758,15237,8500,A 0.1-to-1.2GHz tunable 6th-order N-path channel-select filter with 0.6dB passband ripple and +7dBm blocker tolerance,2013,"Radio receivers should be robust to large out-of-band blockers with small degradation in their sensitivity. N-path mixers can be used as mixer-first receivers [1] with good linearity and RF filtering [2]. However, 1/f noise calls for large active device sizes for IF circuits and high power consumption. The 1/f noise issue can be relaxed by having RF gain. However, to avoid desensitization by large out-of-band blockers, a bandpass filter (BPF) with sharp cut-off frequency is required in front of the RF amplifiers. g m -C BPFs suffer from tight tradeoffs among DR, power consumption, Q and f c . Also, on-chip Q-enhanced LC BPFs [3] are not suitable due to low DR, large area and non-tunability. Therefore, bulky and non-tunable SAW filters are used. N-path BPFs offer high Q while their center frequency is tuned by the clock frequency [2]. Compared to g m -C filters, this technique decouples the required Q from the DR. The 4-path filter in [4] has only 2 nd -order filtering and limited rejection. The order and rejection of N-path BPFs can be increased by cascading [5], but this renders a “round” passband shape. The 4 th -order 4-path BPF in [6] has a “flat” passband shape and high rejection but a high NF. This work solves the noise issue of [6] while achieving the same out-of-band linearity and adding 25dB of voltage gain to relax the noise requirement of the subsequent stages."
1564046,15237,8500,A 5Gb/s single-ended parallel receiver with adaptive FEXT cancellation,2012,"In high-speed communication with a data rate of multi-Gb/s, the crosstalk noise induced by electromagnetic coupling is becoming a significant noise source, requiring careful considerations in the design of transceiver circuits as well as physical dimension of the transmission lines. When an input voltage of V i  is applied to one of two parallel transmission lines, the induced voltages at the victim line by near-end crosstalk (NEXT) and far-end crosstalk (FEXT) can be expressed as V NEXT (t)=1/4[C m /C S +L m /L S ]·{Vi(t)−Vi(t−2t f )}, V NEXT (t)=t f /2[C m /C S −L m /L S ]·dVi(t−t f )/dt (1) where t f , C m , C S , L m  and L S  represent the time-of-flight, the mutual, self-capacitances, mutual, and self-inductances of the transmission line per unit length, respectively. Though NEXT has more energy due the inductive coupling added to the capacitive coupling, the wide distribution in time over 2t f  results in a small peak noise and is a concern only in high-speed low-voltage differential signaling. However, FEXT in parallel microstrip lines causes a significant peak noise due to smaller capacitive coupling by inhomogeneous structure with the upper side exposed to air. The effect of FEXT turns out to be non-zero signal delay at the receiver side, presenting a serious performance-limiting factor in single-ended high-density parallel links such as memory interface [1]."
1493288,15237,8500,A 16mW 78dB-SNDR 10MHz-BW CT-ΔΣ ADC using residue-cancelling VCO-based quantizer,2012,"Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based analog-to-digital conversion presents an attractive means of implementing high-bandwidth oversampling ADCs [1,2]. They exhibit inherent noise-shaping properties and can operate at low supply voltages and high sampling rates [1–3]. However, usage of VCO-based ADCs has been limited due to their nonlinear voltage-to-frequency (V-to-F) transfer characteristic, which severely degrades their distortion performance. Digital calibration is used to combat nonlinearity in an open-loop VCO-based ADC, but 1 st -order noise-shaping mandates high OSRs, thus increasing power dissipation in digital circuits, even in a nanometer-scale CMOS process [1]. In [2], nonlinearity is suppressed by embedding the VCO in a ΔΣ loop. While this technique works in principle, the need for large loop gain at high frequencies makes it very difficult to achieve high SNDR. For instance, the suppression level near the band edge is approximately 20dB for a VCO-based 2 nd -order modulator operating with an over-sampling ratio (OSR) of 30. Our ADC overcomes the impact of VCO non-linearity by minimizing the input signal processed by the VCO. The prototype achieves 78.3dB SNDR in a 10MHz signal bandwidth at 600MHz sampling rate, while consuming 16mW power."

The radar chip, including receiver, transmitter, quadrature DDS, phase-locked loop (PLL) and analog to digital converter (ADC), has been implemented in a 0.13μm BiCMOS technology. The stretch processing technique is employed to translate the time interval between the received and the transmitted chirp signals to a single tone at the baseband output with greatly reduced bandwidth, which allows for the use of a low-cost ADC with a reduced input bandwidth of 10MHz for digitizing the received RF chirp with a bandwidth of 150MHz. A Weaver receiver with a dc-offset is employed in order to use a single ADC for detecting the received quadrature signals with image rejection. A quadrature 1GHz DDS with an inverse sinc function for zero-order hold correction is implemented to provide the chirp signals for both receiver and transmitter. A wide-tuning PLL frequency synthesizer is integrated to generate the local oscillator (LO) signals as well as the clock signal for the DDS and ADC. The implemented radar-on-chip (RoC) MMIC occupies a die area of 3.5 × 2.5mm.

One of the primary challenges in using CGRAs is to develop efficient compilers that can automatically and efficiently map applications to the CGRA. To this end, this paper makes several contributions: i)  Using Re-computation for Resource Limitations:  For the first time in CGRA compilers, we propose the use of re-computation as a solution for resource limitation problem. This extends the solutions space, and enables better mappings, ii)  General Problem Formulation:  A precise and general formulation of the application mapping problem on a CGRA is presented, and its computational complexity is established. iii)  Extracting an Efficient Heuristic:  Using the insights from the problem formulation, we design an effective global heuristic called EPIMap. EPIMap transforms the input specification (a directed graph) to an Epimorphic equivalent graph that satisfies the necessary conditions for mapping on to a CGRA, reducing the search space. Experimental results on 14 important kernels extracted from well known benchmark programs show that using EPIMap can improve the performance of the kernels on CGRA by more than 2.8X on average, as compared to one of the best existing mapping algorithm, EMS. EPIMap was able to achieve the theoretical best performance for 9 out of 14 benchmarks, while EMS could not achieve the theoretical best performance for any of the benchmarks. EPIMap achieves better mappings at acceptable increase in the compilation time."
859976,15237,8500,A 1.36μW adaptive CMOS image sensor with reconfigurable modes of operation from available energy/illumination for distributed wireless sensor network,2012,"For outdoor surveillance, sensitivity and dynamic range are important to deliver reliable images over widely changing illumination. However, constant monitoring with maximum awareness requires large power consumption and is not suitable for energy-limited applications such as battery-operated and/or energy-scavenging wireless sensor nodes. One of the ways to reduce power is voltage scaling [1–4]. However, it significantly reduces the SNR and results in poor image quality [4]. The signal can be easily corrupted from the noise in dark conditions or be saturated in bright conditions. Most imagers with high sensitivity and wide dynamic range [5,6] consume large power >50mW, unsuitable for wireless imager node applications. Therefore, it is imperative to implement a sensor adaptable to environmental changes: i.e., the sensor keeps monitoring at extremely low power operation and only turns into high-sensitivity or wide-dynamic-range operations when requested due to illumination changes or requested from the host for detailed image transmission. The sensor changes its operation back to the monitoring mode as a default or when enough operating energy is not available from the battery or energy-harvester. In this paper, we report an adaptive CMOS image sensor that employs four different modes: monitoring, normal, high-sensitivity and wide-dynamic-range (WDR) modes. This adaptable feature enables reliable monitoring while significantly enhancing battery lifetime for wireless image-sensor nodes."
1748684,15237,23593,Using high-level synthesis and formal analysis to predict and preempt attacks on industrial control systems,2014,"Industrial control systems (ICSes) have the conflicting requirements of security and network access. In the event of large-scale hostilities, factories and infrastructure would more likely be targeted by computer viruses than the bomber squadrons used in WWII. ICS zero-day exploits are now a commodity sold on brokerages to interested parties including nations. We mitigate these threats not by bolstering perimeter security, but rather by assuming that potentially all layers of ICS software have already been compromised and are capable of launching a latent attack while reporting normal system status to human operators. In our approach, application-specific configurable hardware is the final authority for scrutinizing controller commands and process sensors, and can monitor and override operations at the lowest (I/O pin) level of a configurable system-on-chip platform. The process specifications, stability-preserving backup controller, and switchover logic are specified and formally verified as C code, and synthesized into hardware to resist software reconfiguration attacks. To provide greater assurance that the backup controller can be invoked before the physical process becomes unstable, copies of the production controller task and plant model are accelerated to preview the controller's behavior in the near future."

Meanwhile, accurate thermal analysis is very time-consuming and thus can hardly be incorporated into most of placement algorithms generally performing numerous iterative refinement steps. As a consequence, in this paper, we first present a fine-grained grid-based thermal model for the 3D regular FPGA architecture and also highlight that lateral heat dissipation paths can no longer be assumed negligible. Then we propose two fast thermal-aware placement algorithms for 3D FPGAs, Standard Deviation (SD) and MineSweeper (MS), in which rapid thermal evaluation instead of slow detailed analysis is utilized. Moreover, both take the lateral heat dissipation into consideration and focus on distributing heat sources more evenly within a layer in a 3D FPGA to avoid creating hotspots. Experimental results show that SD and MS achieve 12.1%/7.6% reduction in maximum temperature and 82%/56% improvement in temperature deviation compared with a classical thermal-unaware placement method only at the cost of minor increase in wirelength and delay. Moreover, MS merely consumes 4% more runtime for producing thermal-aware placement solutions."
2131628,15237,8500,An organic VCO-based ADC for quasi-static signals achieving 1LSB INL at 6b resolution,2013,"Smart sensors embedded in packaging films for food or pharmaceuticals, and read out using RFID protocols, are an important future application of large-area organic electronics. The first steps towards flexible organic electronics were code generators for RFID tags [1]. To realize flexible smart sensors it is also essential to develop analog sensor interfaces and ADCs, which will enable the integration of sensors, data processing and RF communication (Fig. 6.6.1) on the same plastic foil [2]. This paper focuses on the design of an organic ADC for quasi-static signals, like the ones provided by chemical and temperature sensors. Only a few ADCs made with organic TFTs (OTFTs) have been reported [3,4] so far. Their linearity is limited by the poor matching typical of organic technologies and reached an INL of 2.6LSB at 6b resolution before calibration. This paper addresses an ADC whose linearity is not related to the matching of OTFTs or capacitances, but relies on the electrical properties of a transconductor. Even without calibration, the INL is 1LSB and the DNL is 0.6LSB at 6b resolution. The converter is manufactured in a double-gate p-type OTFT technology [5], which provides two gates to control the semiconductor channel, G and TG (Fig. 6.6.1): a voltage applied to the top gate TG produces a linearly proportional shift of the threshold voltage."
1001404,15237,9772,Recent research and emerging challenges in the System-Level Design of digital microfluidic biochips,2011,"Microfluidic biochips are replacing the conventional biochemical analyzers, and are able to integrate on-chip all the basic functions for biochemical analysis. The “digital” biochips are manipulating liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on a two-dimensional array of electrodes. Basic microfluidic operations, such as mixing and dilution, are performed on the array, by routing the corresponding droplets on a series of electrodes. The challenges facing biochips are similar to those faced by microelectronics some decades ago. Computer-Aided Design tools for microfluidics are in their infancy, and designers are currently using manual, bottom-up design approaches to implement such biochips. Considering their architecture and the design tasks that have to be performed, the design of digital biochips has similarities to the high-level synthesis of integrated circuits. Motivated by this similarity, a few researchers have recently started to propose approaches for the top-down design of biochips. So far, they have assumed that operations are executing on virtual modules of rectangular shape, formed by grouping adjacent electrodes, and which have a fixed placement on the array. However, operations can actually execute by routing the droplets on any sequence of electrodes on the biochip. In this paper, we outline the original module-based synthesis problem, and then we present recent work which eliminates the concept of virtual modules and allows droplets to move on the chip on any route during operation execution. We discuss the advantages of such an approach, and identify the challenges and opportunities of system-level design of digital microfluidic biochips."
783132,15237,23836,FPGA Redundancy Configurations: An Automated Design Space Exploration,2014,"With ever-decreasing CMOS transistor sizes, integrated circuits are becoming more and more susceptible to errors. A commonly used approach to improve the reliability of digital circuits is triple modular redundancy (TMR). TMR instantiates three copies of a circuit plus additional voter circuits to take majority decisions on the output values. Prior research has studied variations in TMR voting structures that bring about improvements in performance factors such as area utilization, power consumption and latency at the price of slight degradation in output reliability. In this paper, we extend previous studies by utilizing different redundancy configurations and voter-insertion algorithms to observe variation in these performance factors for FPGA designs. To maintain an automated tool flow for redundancy insertion into a digital design, we enhance the functionality of the previous BYU-LANL TMR tool to include alternative TMR and cascaded TMR redundancy configurations. Design space exploration experiments with different ISCAS circuit benchmarks show that the choice of an appropriate redundancy configuration and voter-insertion algorithm has a strong impact on optimizing performance factors. To support a designer with selecting a redundant implementation, we present a design space exploration tool flow that takes a circuit as input and identifies Pareto-optimal implementations with respect to the four objectives reliability level, utilized FPGA area, latency and dynamic power consumption."
2189323,15237,20649,Emulation based high-accuracy throughput estimation for high-speed connectivities: case study of USB2.0,2011,"When designing an SoC (system-on-chip), one should ensure that the chip's architecture delivers optimal data throughput for high-speed connectivity blocks on practical use, taking of several layers of software into account. Previous works such as simulation based estimation method or analytical method that focused on estimation of low level throughput in link layer are not adequate for accurately estimating throughput of the real silicon SoC because practical use cases of such complex connectivity blocks typically require extensive software operation on top of platform operating systems like Linux. FPGA-based emulation, therefore, is commonly used to verify functional correctness of complex connectivity blocks in a more realistic usage scenario with real connectivity devices like USB 2.0 mass storage devices. Speed of FPGA emulation, though, is scaled down significantly because of inherent limitation of FPGA emulation while speed of interface to real connectivity devices is required to be at-speed for compliance with connectivity specification standards. For this reason, scaling factors of speed are not uniform and, thus, measurement of performance is not accurate. This paper proposes a method to compensate errors due to the non-uniform scaling factors. In the proposed method, measurements of various parameters in FPGA emulation are applied to a high-accuracy estimation model that we created. Our method was applied to USB2.0, and the experimental result shows 4.1% of estimation error."
1404825,15237,9772,All aboard the Databus!: Linkedin's scalable consistent change data capture platform,2012,"In Internet architectures, data systems are typically categorized into source-of-truth systems that serve as primary stores for the user-generated writes, and derived data stores or indexes which serve reads and other complex queries. The data in these secondary stores is often derived from the primary data through custom transformations, sometimes involving complex processing driven by business logic. Similarly data in caching tiers is derived from reads against the primary data store, but needs to get invalidated or refreshed when the primary data gets mutated. A fundamental requirement emerging from these kinds of data architectures is the need to reliably capture, flow and process primary data changes.   We have built Databus, a source-agnostic distributed change data capture system, which is an integral part of LinkedIn's data processing pipeline. The Databus transport layer provides latencies in the low milliseconds and handles throughput of thousands of events per second per server while supporting infinite look back capabilities and rich subscription functionality. This paper covers the design, implementation and trade-offs underpinning the latest generation of Databus technology. We also present experimental results from stress-testing the system and describe our experience supporting a wide range of LinkedIn production applications built on top of Databus."
2129568,15237,8494,An 1.92mW Feature Reuse Engine based on inter-frame similarity for low-power object recognition in video frames,2014,"A Feature Reuse Engine (FReE) is proposed to achieve low-power object recognition in video frames. Previous object recognition processors perform redundant processing for repeated features of sequential frames in video. Unlike previous works, proposed FReE reuses 58% of features from previous frame with inter-frame similarity. However, false reuse can degrade the object recognition accuracy. By pixel intensity-based Near Pixel Information (NPI), FReE can decide the reusability with 96% of accuracy. Additionally, to minimize latency and power overhead of FReE, a dedicated integral image generator and NPI generator are proposed. As a result, power consumption of object recognition processor is reduced by 31% with the proposed FReE which consumes only 1.92mW in a 130nm CMOS technology. The major power for object recognition is consumed in feature extraction from each video frames. In the case of HD 720p resolution, about 3,000 features are extracted from each video frames. To resolve the bottleneck, we propose feature reuse model which is based on inter-frame similarity. It reuses features of previous frame, while other previous object recognition processors processed repeatedly the redundant features of sequential frames in video. By this model, 58% of features can be reused from previous frame. However, in this approach, false reuse can degrade the object recognition accuracy. To achieve accurate feature reuse, we propose pixel- intensity-based Near Pixel Information (NPI) which considers the scale of the keypoints. Also, an integral image is adopted to reduce the NPI generation time. In addition, a dedicated hardware design of integral image generator and NPI generator minimize both latency and power overhead of the proposed Feature Reuse Engine (FReE). The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the proposed feature reuse model. And Section III describes the architecture of the proposed FReE. Then implementation results will be covered at Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes this paper."
937009,15237,20649,Model-based development and verification of control software for electric vehicles,2013,"Most innovations in the automotive domain are realized by electronics and software. Modern cars have up to 100 Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that implement a variety of control applications in a distributed fashion. The tasks are mapped onto different ECUs, communicating via a heterogeneous network, comprising communication buses like CAN, FlexRay, and Ethernet. For electric vehicles, software functions play an essential role, replacing hydraulic and mechanic control systems. While model-based software development and verification are already used extensively in the automotive domain, their importance significantly increases in electric vehicles as safety-critical functions might no longer rely on mechanical (fall-back) solutions. The need for reducing costs, size, and weight in electric vehicles has also resulted in a considerable interest in topics such as the consolidation of ECUs as well as  efficient  implementation of control software. In this paper we discuss two broad issues related to model-based software development and verification in electric vehicles. The first is concerned with how to ensure that model-level semantics are preserved in an implementation, which has important implications on the verification and certification of control software. The second issue is related to techniques for reducing the computational and communication demands of distributed automotive control algorithms. For both these topics we provide a broad introduction to the problem followed by a discussion on state-of-the-art techniques."
1092067,15237,22288,Workload Prediction of Virtual Machines for Harnessing Data Center Resources,2014,"Virtual Machines (VM) offer data-center and cloud owners the option to lease computational resources such as CPU cycles, Memory, Disk space and Network bandwidth to end-users. Optimal usage of the resources of the Physical Machines (PM) that make up the cloud is an important consideration as a lot of major enterprises and institutions are opting for servers in the cloud. At any given time, the PMs should not be overloaded to meet SLO requirements and at the same time a minimum number of PMs should be running to conserve energy. The resource loads on individual VMs in the data center are not arbitrary. Finding patterns in the loads can help the data center owners arrange the VMs on the PMs such that both of the above requirements are met. In this paper we present a fast, low overhead, framework that intelligently predicts the behavior of the cluster based on its history and then accordingly re-distributes VMs in the cluster to free up PMs. These PMs are then re-purposed to accommodate more VMs or turned off to save energy. We analyze real world loads and show that they follow a Chaotic time series. At the core of our framework are concepts of Chaos Theory with optimizations that make our framework indifferent to the type of loads and inherent cycles in them. We set up this framework on our testbed cluster and analyze its performance. Extensive experimental results for a variety of real world loads, indicate our framework's efficacy compared to other methods reported to date."
2548917,15237,8494,A novel operating-point driven method for the sizing of analog IC,2011,"It is known that the operating-point driven (OPD) analog sizing methods have clear advantages compared with the sizing methods of directly using transistor width and length as the decision variables. However, new analog sizing algorithms using OPD technique in modern technologies have seldom been reported in recent years. One of the main reasons is that with the scaling down of the technologies, the transistor models are much more complex, which makes the available DC root solving algorithms and the look-up-table-based methods face significant challenges on accuracy, efficiency and memory requirements. Instead of solving the equations to find the width of transistors, interpolating in a pre-constructed look-up-table, or using regression methods, a novel method, called on-line interpolation operating-point driven (OIOPD), is proposed. OIOPD finds the width of the transistor by the interpolation of the width-current curve with already determined length and voltage biases. The lower and upper points to decide the interpolated value are generated by on-line simulations using the two extreme values of the width in a technology. Experimental results in 0.25µm, 0.18 µm and 90nm technologies show that OIOPD has 10 times improvement on accuracy, 300–1100 times improvement on efficiency compared with the available methods. In addition, no extra memory (e.g. the memory to save the look-up table) is needed. These advantages make OIOPD suitable for operating-point driven analog sizing methods in modern technologies. A practical analog sizing example using OIOPD is also provided."
1199087,15237,11157,Architectural perspectives of future wireless base stations based on the IBM PowerEN™ processor,2012,"In wireless networks, base stations are responsible for operating on large amounts of traffic at high speed rates. With the advent of new standards, as 4G, further pressure is put in the hardware requirements to satisfy speeds of up to 1 Gbps. In this work, we study the applicability and potential benefits of the IBM PowerEN processor (a multi-core, massively multithreaded platform) in the realm of base stations for the 3G and 4G standards. The approach involves exploiting the throughput computation capabilities of the PowerEN processor, replacing the bus-attached special-function accelerators with a layer of in-line universal acceleration support, incorporated within the cores. A key feature of this in-line accelerator is a bank-based very-large register file, with embedded SIMD support. This processor-in-regfile (PIR) strategy is implemented as local computation elements (LCEs) attached to each bank, overcoming the limited number of register file ports. Because each LCE is a SIMD computation element, and all of them can proceed concurrently, the PIR approach constitutes a highly-parallel super-wide-SIMD device. To target a broad spectrum of applications for base stations, we also consider a PIR-based architecture built upon reconfigurable LCEs. In this paper, we evaluate the in-line universal accelerator and the PIR strategy focusing on two specific applications for base stations: FFT and Turbo Decoding."
1309721,15237,9078,A 2014 Mbin/s deeply pipelined CABAC decoder for HEVC,2014,"High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the latest video standard that specifies video resolutions up to 8K Ultra-HD (UHD) at 120 fps to support the next decade of video applications. This results in high throughput requirements for the Context Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (CABAC) entropy decoder, which was already a well-known bottleneck in H.264/AVC. Several modifications were made to the HEVC CABAC to address the throughput challenges. This work leverages these improvements in the design of a high throughput HEVC CABAC decoder. The proposed design uses a deeply pipelined architecture to achieve a high clock rate. Additional techniques such as state prefetch logic, latched-based context memory, and separate finite state machines are applied to minimize stall cycles, while multi-bypass bins decoding is used to further increase the throughput. The design is synthesized in a IBM 45nm SOI process, and achieves throughputs up to 2014 and 2748 Mbin/s under common and worst-case test conditions, respectively, at 1.9 GHz operating frequency. The results show that the design is sufficient to decode video bitstreams in real-time at Level 6.2, or at Level 6.0 for applications requiring sub-frame latency."
802303,15237,23593,Side-channel attacks on the bitstream encryption mechanism of Altera Stratix II: facilitating black-box analysis using software reverse-engineering,2013,"In order to protect FPGA designs against IP theft and related issues such as product cloning, all major FPGA manufacturers offer a mechanism to encrypt the bitstream used to configure the FPGA. From a mathematical point of view, the employed encryption algorithms, e.g., AES or 3DES, are highly secure. However, recently it has been shown that the bitstream encryption feature of several FPGA product lines is susceptible to side-channel attacks that monitor the power consumption of the cryptographic module. In this paper, we present the first successful attack on the bitstream encryption of the Altera Stratix II FPGA. To this end, we reverse-engineered the details of the proprietary and unpublished Stratix II bitstream encryption scheme from the Quartus II software. Using this knowledge, we demonstrate that the full 128-bit AES key of a Stratix II can be recovered by means of side-channel analysis with 30,000 measurements, which can be acquired in less than three hours. The complete bitstream of a Stratix II that is (seemingly) protected by the bitstream encryption feature can hence fall into the hands of a competitor or criminal - possibly implying system-wide damage if confidential information such as proprietary encryption schemes or keys programmed into the FPGA are extracted. In addition to lost IP, reprogramming the attacked FPGA with modified code, for instance, to secretly plant a hardware trojan, is a particularly dangerous scenario for many security-critical applications."
1689449,15237,20649,Hybrid energy storage systems and battery management for electric vehicles,2013,"Electric vehicles (EV) are considered as a strong alternative of internal combustion engine vehicles expecting lower carbon emission. However, their actual benefits are not yet clearly verified while the energy efficiency can be improved in many ways. The carbon emission benefits from EV is largely diminished if we charge EV with electricity from petroleum power plants due to power loss during generation, transmission, conversion and charging. On the other hand, regenerative braking is direct power conversion from the wheel to battery and one of the most important processes that can enhance energy efficiency of EV. Power loss during regenerative braking can be reduced by hybrid energy storage system (HESS) such that supercapacitors accept high power as batteries have small rate capability.   Conventional charge management does not systematically exchange charge between the supercapacitor and battery. However, asymmetry in acceleration and deceleration as well as battery charging and discharging capability make the supercapacitor state of charge (SoC) management override the efficiency optimization. Unlike previous works, we show how charge migration during idle and cruise/stopping time can be beneficial in terms of energy efficiency and cruise range. Systematic charge migration decouples SoC management and charging efficiency optimization giving a higher degree of freedom to charging efficiency optimization. We demonstrate the proposed charge migration between the supercapacitor and battery improves energy efficiency by 19.4%."
780670,15237,8494,A low-power fast-settling bond-wire frequency synthesizer with a dynamic-bandwidth scheme,2012,"For the node chips of wireless sensor networks (WSN), low power and fast settling are the two most important factors. In this paper, a low-power fast-settling phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizer working at 1.72 GHz∼1.74 GHz is designed for a 100 kb/s gauss frequency shift keying (GFSK) WSN transceiver. Low power consumption is realized by a bond-wire voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and a multi-stage power-scaling prescaler. Instead of conventional diode-based electro-static discharge (ESD) protection, resistor-based ESD protection is proposed for the bond-wire VCO to decrease the parasitic capacitance so that the automatic frequency calibration (AFC) range is enlarged by 50%. In addition, a dynamic-bandwidth scheme is proposed to meet the requirements of time-division half-duplex WSN systems. The chip is implemented with HJTC 0.18 µm CMOS technology. Measured results show that the PLL consumes 10.6 mW and settles within 18 µs including the AFC process; the phase noise is −91.9 dBc/Hz@10 kHz and −119.3 dBc/Hz@1 MHz under the receiving (Rx) state, and −95.2 dBc/Hz@10 kHz and −116.8 dBc/Hz@1 MHz under the transmitting (Tx) state."
667330,15237,8494,Design for cold test elimination - facing the Inverse Temperature Dependence (ITD) challenge,2012,"Historically, circuits that operate in a high-temperature region could cause an increase in the total delay (td) especially in the process technology prior to the 90nm node. This was because both interconnects and transistors were slowing down as the temperature rose. However, for transistors with the 90nm process technology and beyond, this phenomena has started to change. In particular, the threshold voltage, V t , to supply voltage, VCC, ratio of high-V t  cells in a library is now very close to 1. As a result, the consequence of this event is called an Inverted Temperature Dependence (ITD) effect. There are two key parameters that determine the transistor temperature behavior. They are the mobility, μ, and the threshold voltage, V t . Both decrease with an increasing temperature. This new, complicated dependence of delay vs. temperature poses new challenges to circuit designers. This paper describes the physics behind the ITD effect on the design of modern, nanometer VLSI circuits. We also provide a case study that demonstrates a new ITD effect compensation feature. This new design approach will produce an outgoing level of quality that minimizes the risk of eliminating the cold test elimination (CTE) in the manufacturing. The elimination of cold test will help improving manufacturing capacity for optimized cycle time and product delivery. Hence, this new ITD design breakthrough has been proliferated to the recent process technology nodes."
1596940,15237,23593,Effect of fixed-point arithmetic on deep belief networks (abstract only),2013,"Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) are state-of-the-art learning algorithms building on a subset of neural networks, Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). DBNs are computationally intensive posing the question of whether DBNs can be FPGA accelerated. Fixed-point arithmetic can have an important influence on the execution time and prediction accuracy of a DBN. Previous studies have focused only on customized RBM accelerators with a fixed data-width. Our results experiments demonstrate that variable data-widths can obtain similar performance levels. We can also observe that the most suitable data-widths for different types of DBN are not unique or fixed. From this we conclude that a DBN accelerator should support various data-widths rather than only fixed one as done in previous work. The processing performance of DBN accelerators in FPGA is almost always constrained not by the capacity of the processing units, but by their on-chip RAM capacity and speed. We propose an efficient memory sub-system combining junction and padding methods to reduce bandwidth usage for DBN accelerators, which shows that supporting various data-widths is not as difficult as it may sound. The cost is only little in hardware terms and does not affect the critical path. We design a generation tool to help users reconfiguring the memory sub-system with arbitrary data-width flexibly. Our tool can also be used as an advanced IP core generator above FPGA memory controller supporting parallel memory access in irregular data-width for other applications."
2253720,15237,8500,A 77% energy-saving 22-transistor single-phase-clocking D-flip-flop with adaptive-coupling configuration in 40nm CMOS,2011,"Flip-flops (FF) typically consume more than 50% of random-logic power in an SoC chip, due to their redundant transition of internal nodes, when the input and the output are in the same state. Several low-power techniques have been proposed [1–5], but all of them incur transistor-count penalties, leading to an increase in size, which is too costly since flip-flops typically account for 50% of random-logic area. In this work, we design and test a D-flip-flop, known as adaptive-coupling flip-flop (ACFF), which has a reduced transistor count compared to other low-power flip-flops, and 2 fewer transistors than the mainstream transmission-gate flip-flop (TGFF). ACFF features a single-phase clocking structure, with no local clock buffer and no precharging stage, enabling it to be more energy efficient than TGFF, where up to 77% energy saving is achieved at 0% data activity. ACFF also has an adaptive-coupling configuration, which weakens state-retention coupling during a transition, allowing it to be tolerant to process variations. Test chips are fabricated in a 40nm CMOS technology for 1.1V application, and 500k ACFFs are tested over all chips in 5 skew wafers. All tested ACFFs are fully functional down to 0.75V supply voltage, with spreads of timing parameters comparable to TGFF. We also demonstrate a P&R test by employing ACFF to a wireless LAN chip, and the results indicate chip power is reduced by as much as 24%."
771692,15237,8500,A 75μW real-time scalable network controller and a 25μW ExG sensor IC for compact sleep-monitoring applications,2011,"Recently, a wearable body-sensor network realized continuous sleep monitoring by ExG (EEG, EMG, EOG, and ECG) extraction from a sleeper's face [1]. At least 14 sensors were placed on the face, and were managed by a network controller for sleep monitoring. However, the system in [2] was too bulky and heavy (127×63.5×28mm 3 , 210g) to wear during sleep, and consumed high power (>100mW). Another system used a CMOS IC sensor for smaller power consumption (5 to 10mW/sensor), but it was still inconvenient to wear due to its cumbersome size (49×19×6mm 3 ) [3]. This paper presents a 5g sub-500VW compact sleep-monitoring system based on a low-power network controller and ExG sensors, and Planar Fashionable Circuit Board (P-FCB) technology [4]. The entire sleep monitor operates on a 1.5V 10mAh single tiny coin battery (Φ=5.8mm, T=2.1mm, 200mg) stacked on the controller chip. The power dissipation of 14 sensors and a controller is below 425μW, which is <1.5% of previous works [2–3]. Its low power consumption is possible by the Linked-List Manager (LLM)-based protocol such as Adaptive Dual-Mode Control (ADMC) and Continuous Data Transmission (CDT), and low-swing clock and data transceivers."
989816,15237,23735,"Towards a minimal architecture for a printable, modular, and robust sensing skin",2012,"This work presents a low-complexity modular sensor grid architecture to provide a smart skin to non-convex shapes, such as a robot body and legs. To configure a sensing skin shaped by arbitrary cuts and rapid changes in designs, we use a wavefront planning approach to generate a minimum-depth spanning tree of an arbitrary topology of contiguous, regularly arranged modular sensing units on a flexible substrate wired network. A Finite State Machine protocol for extracting this topology and sensor information is shown that is robust to destructive sensor loss, device failure, and transmission noise. The architecture is designed to require as little state complexity at each node as possible to minimize the area and cost of such a network implemented in printable semiconductor technology. Simulation data show recovery from network failures and extension of the architecture to larger networks with arbitrary geometry, and a sample synthesis of the verified architecture logic is shown to have a very low state and combinational logic complexity. A proof-of-concept implementation of the architecture using microcontrollers and optical proximity sensors on a flexible substrate show integration with a Scaled Composite Manufacturing process used for Biomimetic Millirobots."
800518,15237,8335,Invasive Computing for robotic vision,2012,"Most robotic vision algorithms are computationally intensive and operate on millions of pixels of real-time video sequences. But they offer a high degree of parallelism that can be exploited through parallel computing techniques like Invasive Computing. But the conventional way of multi-processing alone (with static resource allocation) is not sufficient enough to handle a scenario like robotic maneuver, where processing elements have to be shared between various applications and the computing requirements of such applications may not be known entirely at compile-time. Such static mapping schemes leads to inefficient utilization of resources. At the same time it is difficult to dynamically control and distribute resources among different applications running on a single chip, achieving high resource utilization under high-performance constraints. Invasive Computing obtains more importance under such circumstances, where it offers resource awareness to the application programs so that they can adapt themselves to the changing conditions, at run-time. In this paper we demonstrate the resource aware and self-organizing behavior of invasive applications using three widely used applications from the area of robotic vision - Optical Flow, Object Recognition and Disparity Map Computation. The applications can dynamically acquire and release hardware resources, considering the level of parallelism available in the algorithm and time-varying load."
2106525,15237,8500,A 247 µW 800 Mb/s/pin DLL-Based Data Self-Aligner for Through Silicon via (TSV) Interface,2012,"Among the stacked dies using through silicon via (TSV), data conflictions occur due to process mismatches, which decrease the data valid window and consume unwanted power due to the short circuit current. This paper presents the DLL-based data self-aligner (DBDA), which reduces data conflictions among stacked dies. The stacked dies employing the proposed DBDAs automatically align their data output timings without relying on any control signals from the master die or an extra signal among the stacked die. The DBDA reduces the data confliction time (tDC) due to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations from 500 ps to 50 ps and thereby reduces the short current from 3.62 mA to 0.41 mA. The proposed DBDA has two operation modes: the synchronous self-align mode (SSAM), in which the data is aligned in the external clock domain and the asynchronous self-align mode (ASAM). The lock time of DBDA is less than 20 cycles in SSAM. Additionally, the lock detector (LD) and proposed re-calibrator help the DBDA to find the optimal calibration period under temperature variation. They also reduce the calibration current of DBDA by 45.5%. A prototype DBDA implemented in 130 nm CMOS technology dissipates 247 μW for 800 Mb/s/pin. For reduction of the leakage current during the power down mode or the self-refresh mode, this paper proposes a leakage current controller, which reduces the leakage power by 90.5%."
776972,15237,8494,Nonlinear dynamics in a graphene nanostructured device for energy harvesting,2013,"Nonlinearities have been shown to play an important role in increasing the extracted energy of energy harvesting devices at the macro and micro scales. Vibration-based energy harvesting on the nano scale has also received attention. In this paper, we characterize the nonlinear dynamical behavior of a strained nanostructured graphene for its potential use in energy harvesting applications. A compressed vibrating membrane graphene sheet free from any external excitation is first studied. We present a continuous time dynamical model of the system in the form of a double-well single degree of freedom system. Equilibrium points are obtained and their stability analysis is carried out. Then, random vibrations are considered as the main ambient energy source for the system and its performances in terms of the well occupation zones, RMS value of the position, and the corresponding energy harvested are presented in the steady state non-equilibrium regime when the noise level is considered as a control parameter. From this model, nonlinear analysis is carried out by computing state space trajectories, probability density and FFT spectra under a deterministic excitation.

An 80×80 image pixel array is fabricated in 0.5 μm 3M2P standard CMOS technology, occupying 3×3 mm 2  silicon area. The proposed imager enables various operational modes, including 1) event generator mode, 2) motion tracking mode and 3) video output mode in full-resolution or compression by region of interest (ROI). An ultra low power focal-plane motion detection block, consisting of analog memory and dual-threshold comparator, is integrated in the pixel-level circuit for on-chip motion detection. A hardware-friendly motion tracking algorithm is developed that indicates ROIs according to a strategy based on the detection results. A 12-bit on-chip, off-array ADC is employed to convert the captured light intensity into digital readouts. In order to further reduce the power consumption, lower image resolution is used under the first two modes. A trade-off analysis between the image resolution and detection accuracy is proposed in this paper. In simulation, the total power consumption is 10μW at a frame rate of 30fps and a supply voltage of 3.3V in motion tracking mode. A compression ratio of 14% and an average PSNR of 42dB is achieved in compressive video output mode."
698575,15237,9772,Methodology of exploring ESL/RTL many-core platforms for developing embedded parallel applications,2014,"Developing embedded parallel applications efficiently in modern single-chip many-core architectures is challenging. We present a novel methodology to facilitate crucial issues of parallel software development such as performance evaluation, speedup and bottleneck analysis, and system verification by taking the advantages of exploring many-core platforms in different abstraction levels altogether. To demonstrate our methodology, a design framework is proposed, consisting of a scalable many-core processor architecture and a hardware-independent software layer. Based on the scalable architecture, the prototype platform is also presented in Electronic System Level (ESL) and Register Transfer Level (RTL). The platform integrates sixteen Processing Elements (PEs) and a 4-by-4 mesh-based network with external memory. Our hardware-independent software layer aims at realistic parallel applications in the baremetal environment, i.e., without an Operating System (OS). With the on-chip communication library and system utilities, software built on top of the fast ESL many-core platform can be executed seamlessly on the RTL one. The analysis shows that our ESL simulation model provides relatively accurate performance metrics as compared with the RTL implementation, with up to 773.8 times faster in terms of simulation speed. In addition, we showcase the study of speedup and bottleneck analysis, which justifies the effectiveness of our methodology for embedded applications in many-core architectures."
1266556,15237,9772,PoWER: prediction of workload for energy efficient relocation of virtual machines,2013,"Virtual Machines (VM) offer data center owners the option to lease computational resources like CPU cycles, Memory, Disk space and Network bandwidth to end-users. An important consideration in this scenario is the optimal usage of the resources (CPU cycles, Memory, Block I/O and Network Bandwidth) of the physical machines that make up the cloud or 'machine-farms'. At any given time, the machines should not be overloaded (to ensure certain QoS requirements are met) and at the same time a minimum number of machines should be running (to conserve energy). The loads on individual VMs residing on these machines is, in fact, not absolutely random. Certain patterns can be found that can help the data center owners arrange the VMs on the physical machines such that both of the above conditions are met (minimum number of machines running without any being overloaded). In this work we propose a framework, PoWER that tries to intelligently predict the behavior of the cluster based on its history and then accordingly distributes VMs in the cluster and turns off unused Physical Machines, thus saving energy. Central to our framework are concepts of Chaos Theory that make our framework indifferent to the type of loads and inherent cycles in them as opposed to other current prediction algorithms. We also test this framework on our testbed cluster and analyze its performance. We demonstrate that PoWER performs better than another FFT-based time series method in predicting VM loads and freeing resources on Physical Machines for our test loads."
2293838,15237,8494,A 400 MHz delta-sigma modulator for bandpass IF digitization around 100 MHz with excess loop delay compensation,2011,"The past few years has seen a tremendous amount of work being published in the area of continuous-time delta-sigma ADC designs with various compensation techniques to counter its susceptibility to non-idealities like clock jitter and excess loop delay, to name a few. The focus of this paper is the design of a tunable continuous time bandpass delta-sigma modulator that utilizes an excess loop delay compensation technique proposed in [1] to optimize the SNR of the modulator, besides preserving its stability by incorporating a full clock cycle delay. An improved, low noise, compact gyrator-C structure is proposed to obtain a high-Q bandpass filter subsequently used in the design of a second-order bandpass delta-sigma modulator clocked at 400 MHz for direct conversion of narrow band signals around 100 MHz. The proposed structure eliminates the need of a capacitor bank/array for the coarse tuning of the modulator since this structure enables coarse tuning in the range of 80 to 120 MHz and fine tuning of 5 MHz above or below the centre frequency. This modulator has been implemented in AMI 0.5µ CMOS process and achieves an SNR of 46 dB over a bandwidth of 1 MHz, calculated from post-layout simulations.

2317978,15237,23593,Application specific processor with high level synthesized instructions (abstract only),2014,"The paper deals with the design of application-specific processor which uses high level synthesized instruction engines. This approach is demonstrated on the instance of high speed network flow measurement processor for FPGA. Our newly proposed concept called Software Defined Monitoring (SDM) relies on advanced monitoring tasks implemented in the software supported by a configurable hardware accelerator. The monitoring tasks reside in the software and can easily control the level of detail retained by the hardware for each flow. This way, the measurement of bulk/uninteresting traffic is offloaded to the hardware, while the interesting traffic is processed in the software. SDM enables creation of flexible monitoring systems capable of deep packet inspection at high throughput. We introduce the processor architecture and a workflow that allows to create hardware accelerated measurement modules (instructions) from the description in C/C++ language. The processor offloads various aggregations and statistics from the main system CPU. The basic type of offload is the NetFlow statistics aggregation. We create and evaluate three more aggregation instructions to demonstrate the flexibility of our system. Compared to the hand-written instructions, the high level synthesized instructions are slightly worse in terms of both FPGA resources consumption and frequency. However, the time needed for development is approximately half."
1424931,15237,23593,Operation scheduling and architecture co-synthesis for energy-efficient dataflow computations on FPGAs (abstract only),2012,"Compiling high-level user applications for execution on FPGAs often involves synthesizing dataflow graphs beyond the size of the available on-chip computational resources. One way to address this is by folding the execution of the given dataflow graphs onto an array of directly connected simple configurable processing elements (CPEs). Under this scenario, the performance and energy-efficiency of the resulting system depends not only on the mapping schedule of the compute operations on the CPEs, but also on the topology of the interconnect array that connects the CPEs. This paper presents a framework in which the operation scheduler and the underlying CPE interconnect network topology are co-optimized on a per-application basis for energy-efficient FPGA computation. Given the same application, more than 2.5x difference in energy-efficiency was achievable by the use of different common regular array topologies to connect the CPEs. Moreover, by using irregular application-specific interconnect topologies derived from a genetic algorithm, up to 50% improvement in energy-delay-product was achievable when compared to the use of even the best regular topology. The use of such framework is anticipated to serve as part of a rapid high-level FPGA application compiler since minimum hardware place-and-route is needed to generate the optimal schedule and topology."
1814226,15237,8500,A GPS/Galileo SoC with adaptive in-band blocker cancellation in 65nm CMOS,2011,"The proliferation of location-based applications inside various handheld electronic devices, such as mobile phones and internet tablets, demands the GPS system to have low power consumption, small form-factor and be co-located on the same device with other radio systems, such as cellular, BT, and WLAN. The conventional GPS solution often uses two SAW filters, before and after an external LNA, to meet the requirements of low noise and multi-radio coexistence. Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to remove the external LNA and interstage SAW filter due to size and cost, which presents a great design challenge to achieve high out-of-band linearity with very low power consumption. To fulfill these stringent requirements, a more comprehensive approach is needed to target a radio architecture with a proper RX system budgeting and optimal circuit design. In addition, a GPS system can be desensitized by unexpected in-band blockers generated from other subsystems on the same platform, such as LCD display, PMU, CPU system clocks, etc. The GPS digital baseband processor must possess the capability to withstand in-band blockers without significant performance degradation. This paper presents a GPS/Galileo SoC with an adaptive in-band blocker cancellation scheme, which is implemented in a 65nm CMOS process."
2151819,15237,23907,A 45nm CMOS neuromorphic chip with a scalable architecture for learning in networks of spiking neurons,2011,"Efforts to achieve the long-standing dream of realizing scalable learning algorithms for networks of spiking neurons in silicon have been hampered by (a) the limited scalability of analog neuron circuits; (b) the enormous area overhead of learning circuits, which grows with the number of synapses; and (c) the need to implement all inter-neuron communication via off-chip address-events. In this work, a new architecture is proposed to overcome these challenges by combining innovations in computation, memory, and communication, respectively, to leverage (a) robust digital neuron circuits; (b) novel transposable SRAM arrays that share learning circuits, which grow only with the number of neurons; and (c) crossbar fan-out for efficient on-chip inter-neuron communication. Through tight integration of memory (synapses) and computation (neurons), a highly configurable chip comprising 256 neurons and 64K binary synapses with on-chip learning based on spike-timing dependent plasticity is demonstrated in 45nm SOI-CMOS. Near-threshold, event-driven operation at 0.53V is demonstrated to maximize power efficiency for real-time pattern classification, recognition, and associative memory tasks.

1168644,15237,23593,Asynchronous physical unclonable function using FPGA-based self-timed ring oscillator (abstract only),2014,"Recently, electronic industries have been facing an increased amount of hardware counterfeits. These counterfeit components, when assembled into a product or a system, can not only jeopardize performance and reliability but also create safety issues. Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) provides means to enhance physical security of Integrated Circuits (IC) against piracy and unauthorized access. The proposed design illustrates the feasibility of using self-timed ring oscillators as a novel approach towards PUF implementation for FPGA authentication. The proposed Self-Timed Ring Oscillator PUF (STRO-PUF) consists of two groups of identically laid-out self-timed ring oscillators. Inputs to the PUF are given through a challenge generator, which selects two self-timed ring oscillators from each group. Outputs of oscillators are fed to multiplexers of corresponding groups. Self-timed ring oscillators exploit the inherent features of random process variations by producing varying frequencies. These unpredictable variations in frequencies are captured using frequency comparator, which generates a output bit. A unique set of output bits , or response is generated for each set of input bits, or challenge. This unique Challenge Response Pair (CRP) is used in identifying a particular device. Frequencies generated from these oscillators are read through a logic analyzer. The varying frequencies observed from all the oscillators mapped across different regions of FPGAs range from 16.234 MHz to 125 MHz with the average frequency of 101.446 MHz. Experimental result shows the uniqueness for the PUF response is 49.92% which is very close to the desired 50% factor."
1090711,15237,23907,A programmable analog frequency-locked loop for VCO characterization and test with 8 ppm resolution,2013,"This article presents a digitally controlled analog frequency-locked loop used for VCO characterization and test. The proposed scheme allows a frequency tuning better than 8 parts per million (ppm). The AFLL is implemented in 32nm CMOS technology and standard CMOS library cells are used for all the digital blocks. The AFLL comprises a 17-bit frequency counter running at 5GHz, a 1 st  order sigma-delta modulator used for dithering the correction signal, a charge-pump and capacitance used as integrator and a VCO. The frequency counter generates a count difference between the VCO clock and a reference clock. This difference is then pulse-density modulated and applied to a charge-pump feeding a capacitor that acts as an integrator. The generated output voltage is applied to the VCO tuning port and adjusts its oscillating frequency accordingly. An offset value added to the frequency difference allows the VCO to settle to a proportional frequency offset. Using this architecture, the VCO frequency can accurately be tuned digitally without having to change the frequency of a reference clock or sweeping its tuning voltage. Hence, the proposed AFLL can serve as a design-for-test (DFT) solution allowing characterization and testing of the VCO in an all-digital environment such as for digital automated test equipment (ATE)."
931212,15237,9772,Exploiting memristive device behavior for emerging digital logic and memory applications,2012,"In many ways, conventional integrated circuit technology (i.e., bulk Si CMOS) continues to follow the predictions of Moore's Law but true physical limits are lurking around the corner. Even as the scaling of conventional technologies continues many performance issues (e.g., high power dissipation, increasing thermal effects, and process variations) are forcing circuit and microarchitectural designers to look for novel approaches for emerging systems. One such direction is to utilize the unconventional behavior of novel nanoelectronic devices (e.g., memristors) to develop novel computational architectures that may not be reasonably implementable using conventional CMOS. In this way, emerging architectures may not only allow continued performance improvements but may also open new avenues for computing. The particular technology of interest for this talk, the memristor or memory resistor, has gained a lot of interest in recent years due to its great potential for emerging circuits and systems. We have been working with several collaborators to develop memristive device technologies with the goal of integrating these devices into digital circuits and systems. As part of this talk, an overview of memristors and memristive systems will be provided along with some exploration of how these devices can be leveraged in digital logic and memory circuits."
1297140,15237,8335,Symmetrical buffered clock-tree synthesis with supply-voltage alignment,2013,"For high-performance synchronous systems, non-uniform/non-ideal supply voltages of buffers (e.g., due to IRdrop) may incur a large clock skew and thus serious performance degradation. This paper addresses this problem and presents the first symmetrical buffered clock-tree synthesis flow that considers supply voltage differences of buffers. We employ a two-phase technique of bottom-up clock sink clustering to determine the tree topology, followed by top-down buffer placement and wire routing to complete the clock tree. At each level of processing, clock skew and wirelength are minimized by the determination of buffer embedding regions and the alignment of buffer supply voltages. Experimental results show that our method can reach, on average, respective 76% and 40% clock skew reduction compared to the state-of-the-art work (1) without supply voltage consideration and (2) with an extension for supply voltages based on our top-down flow. The reduction is achieved by marginal resource and runtime overheads. Note that our method can meet the stringent skew constraint set by the 2010 ISPD contest for all cases, while other counterparts cannot. In particular, our work provides a key insight into the importance of handling practical design issues (such as IR-drop) for real-world clock-tree synthesis."

1475586,15237,8494,Live demonstration: Multiple-timescale plasticity in a neuromorphic system,2013,"I. Demo Description Traditionally, neuromorphic ICs have integrated only reduced subsets of the rich repertoire of plasticity seen in biological preparations [1], [2]. The focus with respect to long term plasticity has been mostly on Spike-Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) [1]. Several ICs have also implemented forms of presynaptic short term dynamics, which filter synaptic pulse input, but have no influence on other timescales of plasticity. Here, we demonstrate an IC that implements short-term-, long-term-, and metaplasticity in an integrated way following [3], where these three different timescales interact to form the overall weight at the synapse. Fig. 1 shows an example presynaptic pattern with depression and the membrane trace as input for learning [3]. The resulting analog weight state shows the influence of presynaptic depression in the step increases, comparable to [1]. Also, different settings for the learning threshold exhibit a bias towards weight increase/decrease on a metaplastic (i.e. slow) timescale similar to [2]. The overall setup features several Maple-ICs of each 16 neurons and 512 of the above synapses, interlinked via FPGA-based pulse transmission. This allows network sizes of up to 200 neurons, sufficient to demonstrate the necessity for this type of learning for a range of computational neuroscience models."
1294386,15237,23593,Towards automated optimisation of tool-generated HW/SW sopc designs (abstract only),2011,"Currently C-to-hardware (C2H) compilation tools have the potential to generate high-performing and efficient hardware functions from application source code. But often this is not realised without expensive manual code modifications to massage the input source code into a form whereby the compiler can extract maximum meaning from it, thus improving the quality of generated hardware. These modifications represent a significant hurdle for software developers; to improve this we present our work towards a semi-automated compilation framework that attempts to streamline this design flow. The proposed framework consists of an extensible analysis phase of input source code and automated generation of code-mutations that serve as trial candidates. These are then automatically combined within the greater SoPC environment and passed through a parallel compilation stage through the C2H tool. Based on the compilation results the process can be refined and re-executed after manually-assisted candidate pruning. In experimental results, a significant performance speedup has been demonstrated when applying these techniques to simple examples which were compiled out-of-the-box with the same C2H tool. Moreover, minimal extra development effort was necessary to achieve these results. Open challenges still remain, but we believe the promise of such an augmented approach to tool-generated SoPC designs is clear."
2413877,15237,23836,A Performance and Area Efficient Architecture for Intrusion Detection Systems,2011,"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have emerged as one of the most promising ways to secure systems in network. An IDS operates by scanning packet-data for known signatures and accordingly takes requisite action. However, scanning bytes in the packet payload and checking for more than 20,000 signatures becomes a computationally intensive task. Additionally, with signatures doubling almost every 30 months, this complexity will aggravate further. IDS commonly uses the Aho-Corasick state machine based search to scan packets for signatures. However, the huge size of the state machine negatively impacts the performance and area efficiency of the underlying hardware. In this work, we propose novel mechanisms to compactly store the state machine thereby improving the area efficiency. We observe over 2X reduction in area for storing the state machine in comparison to BS-FSM [19]. We investigate various approaches to improve the performance efficiency. We pipeline the processing of consecutive bytes accessing the upper-most level, the frequently accessed level, of the state machine. In order to further enhance the performance efficiency, we use a dedicated hardware unit specifically tuned for traversal using our proposed storage mechanism. We observe that our proposed architecture outperforms BS-FSM based approaches [13, 14, 19]."

Reducing FPGA design compilation times without degrading circuit performance is crucial. In this work, we describe a novel approach for incremental design flows that both identifies tightly grouped FPGA logic blocks and then uses this information during circuit placement. Our approach reduces placement run-time on average by more than 17% while typically maintaining the design's critical path delay and marginally increasing its minimum channel width and wire length on average. Instead of following the traditional approach of evaluating a circuit's pre-placement netlist, this new algorithm analyzes designs post-placement to detect proximity data. It uses this information to non-aggressively extract heterogeneous cluster groupings from the design, which we call gems, that consist of two to seventeen clusters. We modified VPR's simulated annealing placement algorithm to use our Singularity Placer, which first crushes each cluster grouping into a singularity, to be treated as a single cluster. We then run the annealer over this condensed circuit, followed by an expansion of the singularities, and a second annealing phase for the entire expanded circuit."

High barriers to entry keep most companies away, and enable high profit margins for the incumbents. The industry has grown greatly over the years, but still constitutes a small portion of the overall semiconductor market. This raises the question to be addressed by this panel: is the FPGA community innovating as much as it should, or is a bias to maintain high profit margins and protect the cash flow of the current FPGA market holding us back from exploring new ideas and products that could greatly expand the appeal of and market for FPGA-related technology? This would be a classic case of the innovator's dilemma defined by Clayton Christensen: it is difficult for a company to engage in creative destruction of a cash cow product.   Our distinguished panel of experts will discuss whether we are seeing major innovation in architectures, design flows and applications, or only incremental improvements. We will also discuss if any new (possibly low margin) application domain is left out by the FPGA industry, what radical ideas should be explored, and whether large incumbents, new startups, academia or some combination are best able to attack these new areas."

Superior bandwidth-density and energy-efficient operation can be realized through dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) and lower transmission losses. There are two main paths towards an integrated platform. Hybrid/heterogeneous designs [1-3] enable each component to be custom-tailored, but suffer from large packaging parasitics, increased manufacturing costs due to requisite process flows, and costly 3D integration or microbump packaging. Monolithic integration mitigates integration overheads, but has not penetrated deeply-scaled technologies due to necessary process customizations [4]. The first monolithic integration of photonic devices and electronic-photonic operation in sub-100 nm (45 nm SOI process with zero foundry changes) is demonstrated in [5]. This paper presents a monolithically integrated optical modulator with a new all-digital driver circuit in a commercial 45nm SOI process. The waveform-conditioning driver circuit enables the carrier-injection modulator to operate at 2.5Gb/s with an energy-cost of 1.23pJ/b, making it ~4× faster and more energy-efficient than the previous monolithically integrated driver/modulator presented in [5]."

In order to exploit the full potential of such emerging GaN power devices, the gate driver that controls the device by a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal is becoming more important. The vital function of the gate driver is to provide an isolated gate signal against the reference source voltage that operates at high voltage. In addition to this function, their integration with GaN power HFETs is also desirable to achieve smaller system size, lower cost and user-friendliness. Although there are several signal isolation techniques for a gate driver such as to use a photo-coupler and wireless pulse transformer [2], these techniques have disadvantages such as large system size and difficulty in integration. Other bootstrap or charge pump techniques [3] in high voltage gate drivers (HVIC) have been developed to generate a reference voltage, but the driver can only be used in particular applications such as inverters. Meanwhile, we have focused our attention on the recent technology of wireless power transmission using an electromagnetic resonant coupler (EMRC) [4] with an open-ring resonator [5], which is very attractive due to its high efficiency in power transmission and its compactness at high frequency."
1549874,15237,8500,A 5.6mV inter-channel DVO 10b column-driver IC with mismatch-free switched-capacitor interpolation for mobile active-matrix LCDs,2013,"To achieve high image quality in mobile active-matrix LCDs, higher DAC resolution and good channel-to-channel uniformity are required in column-driver ICs. In conventional column-driver ICs, the resistor-DAC (R-DAC) architecture has been generally used due to its uniform characteristic, because each R-DAC in driver channels shares a common resistor string for gamma reference-voltage generation. Furthermore, nonlinear gamma correction can be easily implemented using a nonlinear resistor-string that has an inverse transfer curve to the liquid crystal (LC) response. However, the increase in color depth for LCDs results in a large chip-size overhead, thus disclosing the limitation of the R-DAC architecture. To overcome this issue, several hybrid DAC architectures composed of a main 6b R-DAC and a 4b sub-DAC with various interpolation schemes have been reported [1-5]. Their linear interpolation schemes reduce the driver channel size. Meanwhile, their linear 4b interpolation leads to the loss of effective bit resolution for nonlinear gamma correction. In addition, the inevitable mismatch between respective sub-DACs has a significant influence on the channel-to-channel uniform performance of a column-driver IC. In this paper, we present a 10b column-driver IC with a mismatch-free switched-capacitor (SC) interpolation scheme for mobile AMLCDs. The proposed mismatch-free interpolation scheme provides further reduction of the driver size, good linearity, highly uniform channel performance, and more effective bit resolution."

Be significantly different from ASIC where the clock tree is custom built by users, clock network in FPGA is usually fixed after chip fabrication and cannot be changed for different user circuits. This paper is committed to design and implement FPGA clock network with low latency and skew. We first propose a novel clock network for FPG, which is a backbone-branches topology and can be easily integrated to the tiled FPGA with reasonable area. There are one clock backbone and several primary clock branches in the network. When the chip scales up, this clock network can be extended easily. Afterwards, series of strategies such as hybrid multiplexer, bypassing, looping back and Programmable Delay Adjustment Unit (DAU) are employed to optimize latency and skew. Moreover, the prominent couple capacitance and crosstalk effect of clock routing in nanometer are also given consideration in physical implementation. This clock network is applied to own-designed FPGA with 65nm technology. Post-layout simulation results indicate that our clock network with normal loads can uphold 600MHz clock with the maximum clock latency and skew being typically 2.22ns and 40ps respectively, 1.79ns and 39ps in the fast case, achieving up to 78.2% improvement for skew as well as 47.5% for latency, compared to a commercial 65nm FPGA device."

We first present an enhanced dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) scheme that uses power switches to provide rapid changes in the energy-speed operating point to match workloads at a component level. To demonstrate this approach, we describe a data flow processor chip in 90nm CMOS that supports flexible operation from 0.25V with super high energy efficiency up to GHz speeds at 1.2V. This chip shows that our low overhead method to scale energy consumption with the performance requirement supports both high performance and ultra low energy (>10X reduction in energy per operation) in the same circuit. We discuss power switch design for this scheme and investigate strategies for optimizing power switches for different operating modes. Finally, we show how segmented power switches offer several advantages for flexibly managing leakage and for modulating local voltages with low overhead."

A single nanodevice can function as a routing switch in place of a pass transistor and its six-transistor SRAM cell in conventional FPGAs. Defects of nanodevices in programmable interconnects are manifested as losses of configurability and can be categorized into stuck- open defect and stuck- closed defect. First, we show that the stuck-closed defects of nanodevices have a much higher impact than the stuck-open defects. Instead of simply avoiding the stuck-closed defects, we recover them by treating them as shorting constraints in the routing. We develop a scalable algorithm to perform timing-driven routing under these extra constraints. We extend the idea of the resource negotiation to balance the goals of timing and routability under shorting constraints. We also develop several techniques to guide the router to map the shorting clusters to those nets with more shared paths for better utilization of routing resources while automatically balancing it with circuit performance. We also enhance the placement algorithm to recover logic blocks which become virtually unusable due to shorted pins. Simulation results show that at the up-to-date level of nanodevice defects (108-1011x higher than CMOS), compared to the simple avoidance method, our approach reduces the degradation of resource usage by 87%, improves the routability by 37%, and reduce the degradation of circuit performance by 36%, at a negligible overhead of tool runtime."

The receiver has two independent channels to support simultaneous dual-frequency reception, and can be reconfigured to receive various GNSS signals located in 1.2GHz or 1.57GHz band, which have different signal bandwidth including 2.2MHz, 4.2MHz, 8MHz, 10MHz and 18MHz. By flexible frequency plan, low-IF/zero-IF architecture switching and flexible analog baseband circuits, only one frequency synthesizer is adopted to provide local oscillation (LO) for two channels simultaneously, which could avoid the LO crosstalk issue. Analog baseband circuits employ operational amplifiers capable of power scaling to optimize power consumption among various mode operations. Besides, an I/Q mismatch calibration module placed ahead of the IF complex bandpass filter is implemented to improve image rejection ratio. The receiver finally achieves 2.2dB noise figure, an average of 50dB image rejection ratio, and 64dB dynamic range with 1dB gain-adjusting steps, while consuming a minimum of 31mW power."
1142011,15237,23593,Word-length optimization beyond straight line code,2013,"The silicon area benefits that result from word-length optimization have been widely reported by the FPGA community. However, to date, most approaches are restricted to straight line code, or code that can be converted into straight line code using techniques such as loop-unrolling. In this paper, we take the first steps towards creating analytical techniques to optimize the precision used throughout custom FPGA accelerators for algorithms that contain loops with data dependent exit conditions. To achieve this, we build on ideas emanating from the software verification community to prove program termination. Our idea is to apply word-length optimization techniques to find the minimum precision required to guarantee that a loop with data dependent exit conditions will terminate. Without techniques to analyze algorithms containing these types of loops, a hardware designer may elect to implement every arithmetic operator throughout a custom FPGA-based accelerator using IEEE-754 standard single or double precision arithmetic. With this approach, the FPGA accelerator would have comparable accuracy to a software implementation. However, we show that using our new technique to create custom fixed and floating point designs, we can obtain silicon area savings of up to 50% over IEEE standard single precision arithmetic, or 80% over IEEE standard double precision arithmetic, at the same time as providing guarantees that the created hardware designs will work in practice."
1503528,15237,9772,High-level TSV resource sharing and optimization for TSV based 3D IC designs,2013,"Under the current process and layer bonding technology for the TSV (through-silicon-via) based 3D ICs, it is known that the TSV resource is one of the major sources of the function failure of the chip. Furthermore, TSV takes much larger size and pitch than the normal logic components. For this reason, a careful allocation of the TSV resource has been required in 3D IC designs, and several works have been proposed to allocate TSVs minimally or economically. This work addresses the problem of TSV allocation and optimization to overcome one of the critical limitations of the previous works, which is the unawareness or no exploitation of the possibility of TSV resource sharing, previously merely resorting to a simple binding of the data transfers to TSVs. This is because the previous 3D layer partitioners have performed TSV allocation and minimization without any link to the data transfer information accessible from the high-level synthesis flow. This work proposes two TSV resource sharing and optimization algorithms (as a post-processing of 3D layer partitioning) which make use of the life time information of the data transfers taken from the high-level synthesis. Precisely, we propose two algorithms for TSV resource sharing and optimization, which can be selectively applied depending on the sharing granularity and design complexity: word-level TSV sharing and bit-level TSV sharing. Through experiments with benchmark designs, it is confirmed that our proposed algorithms are able to reduce the number of TSVs by 10.5%~41.1% in word-level TSV sharing and 15.5% ~ 45.1% in bit-level TSV sharing at the expense of 2.0% ~ 18.1% increase of 2D wirelength compared with the results produced by the conventional layer partitioning with no TSV sharing while still meeting the timing constraint of designs."
2146796,15237,23836,Hardware-Accelerated Regular Expression Matching with Overlap Handling on IBM PowerEN Processor,2013,"Programmable hardware accelerators for regular expression (regex) matching are evolving into increasingly complex stream processors, which involve multiple state machines that operate in parallel, and specialized post-processors that can process instructions dispatched by the state machines. To improve the speed and the storage-efficiency, complex regexs are decomposed into simpler subexpressions, where each subexpression can fire one or more instructions. Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel. Experiments on regex sets obtained from open-source and proprietary network intrusion detection systems demonstrate orders of magnitude improvement in the storage efficiency over state-of-the-art."
1969826,15237,8500,An 11b 3.6GS/s time-interleaved SAR ADC in 65nm CMOS,2013,"Over the last years several low-power time-interleaved (TI) ADC designs in the 2.5-to-3.0GS/s range have been published [1-3], intended for integration in applications like radar, software-defined radio, full-spectrum cable modems, and multi-channel satellite reception. It is to be expected that future generations of these applications will require a higher ADC sampling rate, while maintaining good high-frequency linearity. Furthermore, a high spectral purity is desired, as spurs can cause an SNR degradation of several dB for weak narrowband signals. For interleaved converters, this mandates an output with limited interleaving artifacts. For the reception of broadband and multi-carrier signals, the gain mismatch and time-skew tones do not typically limit performance, since the spurs are evenly spread over frequency due to the broadband nature of the input signal. The offset mismatches, however, generate spurs at fixed frequencies, thereby representing the main performance limitation. This paper presents a prototype 3.6GS/s 11b TI SAR ADC with a THD that is better than -55dB at 2.5GHz and that has gain and offset spurs below -80dBFS, consuming 795mW in 65nm CMOS."

Not only does this enable increased security of processor platforms, but also achieves unprecedented improvements in power-performance through the adoption of specialized hardware accelerator engines for various compute-intensive cryptography algorithms. In this presentation, we describe novel arithmetic and data-path technologies to enable high-speed on-die AES encryption/decryption accelerators for processor security, Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) compute engines, Galois-Field multipliers for public-key cryptography acceleration and secure on-die key generation using fully-digital random number generators based on metastable state elements. Circuit and design optimizations to enable ultra-low voltage operation of these accelerators are discussed to achieve up to a 10X higher energy-efficiency and a wide dynamic operating voltage range that enables scalable AES encryption/decryption down to sub-10mW per round, enabling power-efficient security to permeate into future mobile/hand-held/wearable devices."
2033196,15237,8500,A 275mW heterogeneous multimedia processor for IC-stacking on Si-interposer,2011,"Most data-intensive operations for multimedia applications such as image processing, vision, and 3D graphics require high external memory bandwidth. In augmented-reality (AR) processors [1], both 3D graphics and vision operations are required, so memory bandwidth becomes even more critical. In [1], however, memory bandwidth is not considered, floating-point processing is not supported, and there is no cache memory for texturing, which is a performance bottleneck of common graphics pipelines. In this work, a heterogeneous multimedia processor is presented to process various mobile multimedia applications in a single chip on Si-interposer for high memory bandwidth. The implemented processor has 4 key features: (1) A transceiver pool (TRx) that reconfigures strength of output drivers according to the channel loss for IC-stacking on Si-interposer, (2) A mode-configurable vector processing unit (MCVPU) for framelevel parallelism, (3) An energy-efficient unified filtering unit (UFU) with adaptive block selection (ABS) algorithm for memory-access-efficient texturing, and (4) a unified shader (US) with floating-point scalar processing elements (SPE) and partial special function units (PSFU) to enhance graphics processing performance and quality. With these techniques, we achieve 1.7× frame rate and 8× memory bandwidth improvement in full AR operation."
1207996,15237,23593,On timing yield improvement for FPGA designs using architectural symmetry (abstract only),2011,"As semiconductor manufacturing technology continues towards reduced feature sizes, timing yield will degrade due to increased process variation. Traditional variation aware design (VAD) methodologies address this problem by using chipwise placement and routing optimizations given the variation distribution is obtained. However, it is very time-consuming to do chipwise variation characterization and optimization. Therefore, this work proposes the use of symmetry in FPGA architectures so that a large range of timing-equivalent configurations can be derived from a single initial implementation by configuration rotation and flipping, allowing the application of post-silicon tuning to mitigate the effects of process variation. Additionally, logic element swaps further improve timing performance. An FPGA design methodology is presented which combines configuration-level redundancy and fine-grained design tuning. The proposed methodology does not need variation characterization and customized placement and routing for each individual FPGA. Compared to other variation aware design methods, it is more cost-efficient in terms of run-time, especially for design implementation on a large amount of FPGAs. Twenty MCNC benchmark circuits in different process technologies were used to show that the proposed method is effective in improving yield and timing in the presence of process variation."
1411036,15237,8494,Field driven STT-MRAM cell for reduced switching latency and energy,2014,"A field driven approach to STT-MRAM switching is proposed as a method for reducing the switching latency of an MTJ in high performance caches. An MRAM array model is presented to characterize the switching energy and maximum achievable reduction in energy using the field driven approach. The switching latency per bit is reduced by more than a factor of ten. The resultant switching energy per bit is reduced by 82% as compared to a standard STT-MRAM. I. INTRODUCTION Spin torque transfer magnetoresistive RAM (STT-MRAM) is an emerging CMOS compatible memory technology with the potential to replace on-chip memory. Key features of STT- MRAM are non-volatility and unlimited write endurance. An issue constraining the use of STT-MRAM, however, is the long switching latency of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) within each memory cell. The long latency causes the switching energy of an MTJ to be much greater than traditional CMOS SRAM. To address these issues, the classic first generation MRAM field topology is utilized with an STT-MTJ where an additional field current destabilizes the MTJ prior to switching, thereby reducing the switching latency. An analytic framework for assessing and optimizing field driven writes in STT-MRAM arrays is described in this paper. Building on this framework, it is shown that the switching latency and energy can be reduced by amortizing the additional field current over many cells, leading to a significant reduction in energy consumed per bit. Background on STT-MRAM and classical MRAM is pro- vided in Section II. The field driven approach is compared with classical MRAM approaches in Section III, while a model of a memory cell is presented in Section IV. A model of an MRAM array is reviewed in Section V. Some conclusions are offered in Section VI."
2007829,15237,8494,"Design automation of transistor networks, a new challenge",2011,"The power optimization of integrated circuits must be observed in all levels of abstraction of the design flow. The traditional standard cell flow don't really takes care of power minimization at physical level, because there is a limited number of logical functions in a cell library, as well a limited number of sizing versions. To really obtain an optimization at physical level, it is needed to allow the use of any possible logical function, by also using complex cells (Static CMOS complex gates - SCCG) that are not available in a cell library. To have a “freedom” in the logic design step, it is needed the use of an EDA set of tools to let the automatic design of any transistor network (even with a different number of P and N transistors). This approach can reduce the amount of transistors needed to implement a circuit, reducing the power consumption, mainly the leakage power that is proportional to the number of components (transistors). This paper presents some examples and comparisons between the standard cell approach and the network of transistors approach. The flexibility of the approach can also let the designers to define layout parameters to cope with problems like tolerance to transient effects, yield improvement, printability and DFM. The designer can also manage the sizing of transistors to reduce power consumption, without compromising the clock frequency."
892027,15237,23593,FPGA-based acceleration of cascaded support vector machines for embedded applications (abstract only),2013,"Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are considered one of the most popular classification algorithms yielding high accuracy rates. However, SVMs often require processing a large number of support vectors, making the classification process computationally demanding, and hence it is challenging to meet real-time processing constraints imposed by many embedded applications. In order to improve SVM classification times the cascade classification scheme has been proposed. However, even in this case real-time performance is still challenging to achieve without exploiting the throughput and processing requirements of each cascade stage. Hence the design of an FPGA-based accelerator for cascaded SVM processing is proposed; in addition to a hardware reduction method in order to reduce the implementation requirements of the cascade SVM leading to significant resource savings. The accelerator was implemented on a Virtex 5 FPGA platform and evaluated using face detection as the target application on 640×480 resolution images. It was compared against FPGA implementations of the same cascade processing architecture but without using the reduction method, and a single parallel SVM classifier. The accelerator is capable an average performance of 70 frames-per-second, achieving a speed-up of 5× over the single parallel SVM classifier. Furthermore, the hardware reduction method results in the utilization of 43% less FPGA LUT resources, with only 0.7% reduction in classification accuracy."
2425626,15237,8335,Fast hybrid simulation for accurate decoded video quality assessment on MPSoC platforms with resource constraints,2011,"Multimedia decoders mapped onto MPSoC platforms exhibit degraded video quality when the critical system resources such as buffer and processor frequency are constrained. Hence, it is essential for system designers to find the appropriate mix of resources, living within the constraints, for a desired output video quality. A naive approach to do this would be to run expensive system simulations of the decoder tasks mapped onto a model of the underlying MPSoC architecture. This turns out to be inefficient when the input video library set has a large number of video clips. We propose a fast hybrid simulation framework to quantitatively estimate decoded video quality in the context of an MPEG-2 decoder. Here, the workload of simulation heavy tasks are estimated using accurate analytical models. The workload of other light (but difficult to analytically model) tasks are obtained from system simulations. This framework enables the system designer to perform a fast trade-off analysis of the system resources in order to choose the optimal combination of resources for the desired video quality. When compared to a naive system simulation approach, the hybrid simulation-based framework shows speed-up factors of about 5× for motion and 8× for still videos. The results obtained using this framework highlight important trade-offs such as the decoded video quality (measured in terms of the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR)) vs buffer size and PSNR vs processor frequency."
2156935,15237,8500,A digital-intensive receiver front-end using VCO-based ADC with an embedded 2nd-Order anti-aliasing Sinc filter in 90nm CMOS,2011,"One of the recent trends in multimode multiband (MMMB) receivers is to remove the analog filter or variable-gain amplifier (VGA) in the receiver chain and employ a wide-dynamic-range ADC directly after the mixer or include the mixer in the ADC [1,2]. While such architecture provides ease of programmability once the signals are digitized, it puts a large burden on the ADC and anti-alias filter. Hence, ADCs typically use high-performance analog circuits for wide dynamic range, even though it is difficult to implement these circuits using low-voltage nanoscale CMOS processes. A promising ADC architecture for an MMMB receiver is the VCO-based ADC, since it offers 1 st -order noise-shaping from its open-loop digital-intensive nature, thus allowing high sampling rate and high SNR [3]. Furthermore, the VCO-based ADC provides an inherent anti-aliasing 1 st -order Sinc filter due to the innate integrating ability of the VCO [4]. Unfortunately, for multiband receivers that do not have an RF pre-filter, a Sinc filter alone does not provide enough out-of-band rejection and hence higher-order anti-aliasing filters are required. In order to solve this problem, we propose a 2 nd -order anti-aliasing Sinc filter (Sinc 2  filter) that provides double the rejection ratio of a Sinc filter. Furthermore, the proposed technique is highly digital and can be embedded in a VCO, resulting in little overhead."
1115493,15237,8500,3D camera based on linear-mode gain-modulated avalanche photodiodes,2013,"In the last few years, both the scientific and industrial communities have shown an increasing interest in range imaging, due to its potential exploitation in various application domains such as robotics, security and surveillance, vehicle safety, gaming, and mobile applications. Among the diversity of techniques available for range detection, Time-of-Flight (ToF) offers advantages in terms of compact system realization, good performance, and low required computational power. The last works on ToF sensors, presenting demodulation sensors based on photon-mixing devices [1, 2], and time-counting sensors based on single-photon avalanche diodes [3], have shown a trend towards higher resolutions, with a consequent reduction of pixel size, higher modulation frequencies, and demodulation contrast to allow better distance precision. In this paper, we introduce a range camera concept that exploits linear-mode avalanche photodiodes (APD) as in-pixel demodulating detectors [4]. Thanks to photocurrent gain modulation, APDs can combine optical sensing and light-signal demodulation in a single device. The main advantage of the APD implementation is the possibility to operate at high frequencies, due to its very wide bandwidth."
1169064,15237,20649,Analysis and characterization of inherent application resilience for approximate computing,2013,"Approximate computing is an emerging design paradigm that enables highly efficient hardware and software implementations by exploiting the inherent resilience of applications to in-exactness in their computations. Previous work in this area has demonstrated the potential for significant energy and performance improvements, but largely consists of ad hoc techniques that have been applied to a small number of applications. Taking approximate computing closer to mainstream adoption requires (i) a deeper understanding of inherent application resilience across a broader range of applications (ii) tools that can quantitatively establish the inherent resilience of an application, and (iii) methods to quickly assess the potential of various approximate computing techniques for a given application. We make two key contributions in this direction. Our primary contribution is the analysis and characterization of inherent application resilience present in a suite of 12 widely used applications from the domains of recognition, data mining, and search. Based on this analysis, we present several new insights into the nature of resilience and its relationship to various key application characteristics. To facilitate our analysis, we propose a systematic framework for Application Resilience Characterization (ARC) that (a) partitions an application into resilient and sensitive parts and (b) characterizes the resilient parts using approximation models that abstract a wide range of approximate computing techniques. We believe that the key insights that we present can help shape further research in the area of approximate computing, while automatic resilience characterization frameworks such as ARC can greatly aid designers in the adoption approximate computing."
1239315,15237,8500,A 4-channel 10.3Gb/s transceiver with adaptive phase equalizer for 4-to-41dB loss PCB channel,2011,"In multi-Gb/s wireline communications, equalizers are used to compensate for channel-induced signal distortion in order to stretch the maximum distance of transmission. Both amplitude and phase can be distorted in a channel. Amplitude distortion is a frequency-dependent attenuation due to skin effect and dielectric loss, causing inter-symbol-interference (ISI). A transmitter (TX) discrete-time pre-emphasis (PE) filter, a receiver (RX) continuous-time Linear Equalizer (LE), and an RX Decision-Feedback Equalizer (DFE) are generally used to cancel ISI. At 10Gb/s or higher data rate, equalizers for up to 33 to 39dB Nyquist loss and up to 20 to 25dB adapted loss range were reported [1–3]. On the other hand, how to compensate phase distortion is not clearly understood in practical circuit design. Theoretically, if a channel has minimum-phase-likecharacteristics, phase distortion is automatically co-equalized with amplitude distortion by a minimum-phase equalizer [4]. While this is the case for high-speed cables [5], it is not for PCB traces, because a non-minimum-phase equalizer, e.g., a PE with a pre-cursor tap, produces lower BER over a high-loss PCB channel than a minimum-phase equalizer, e.g., a PE without a pre-cursor tap. Thus the IEEE 10Gb Ethernet standard for backplanes adopted 3-tap PE with a precursor tap [6]. However, adaptive phase equalization in hardware has not been reported in the literature."
1309530,15237,23735,Low-latency localization by active LED markers tracking using a dynamic vision sensor,2013,"At the current state of the art, the agility of an autonomous flying robot is limited by its sensing pipeline, because the relatively high latency and low sampling frequency limit the aggressiveness of the control strategies that can be implemented. To obtain more agile robots, we need faster sensing pipelines. A Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a very different sensor than a normal CMOS camera: rather than providing discrete frames like a CMOS camera, the sensor output is a sequence of asynchronous timestamped events each describing a change in the perceived brightness at a single pixel. The latency of such sensors can be measured in the microseconds, thus offering the theoretical possibility of creating a sensing pipeline whose latency is negligible compared to the dynamics of the platform. However, to use these sensors we must rethink the way we interpret visual data. This paper presents a method for low-latency pose tracking using a DVS and Active Led Markers (ALMs), which are LEDs blinking at high frequency (>1 KHz). The sensor's time resolution allows distinguishing different frequencies, thus avoiding the need for data association. This approach is compared to traditional pose tracking based on a CMOS camera. The DVS performance is not affected by fast motion, unlike the CMOS camera, which suffers from motion blur."
1119031,15237,8494,A decoding algorithm with reduced complexity for non-binary LDPC codes over large fields,2013,"Non-binary low-density parity-check (NB-LDPC) codes outperform their binary counterparts in some cases, but their high decoding complexity is a significant hurdle to their applications. In this paper, we propose a decoding algorithm with reduced computational complexities and smaller memory requirements for NB-LDPC codes over large fields. First, a simplified algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of variable node processing. To reduce memory requirements, existing NB-LDPC decoders often truncate the message vectors to a limited number n m  of values. However, the memory requirements of these decoders remain high when the field size is large, since n m  needs to be large enough to alleviate error performance degradation. In this paper, an improved trellised based check node processing algorithm is proposed to significantly reduce the memory requirement. The number of elements in a variable-to-check message is reduced to n v  (n v   m ). The sorted log likelihood ratio (LLR) vector of a check-to-variable message is approximated using a piece-wise linear function. Thus, only few LLRs are stored and other LLRs are computed on-the-fly when needed. For each a priori message, most LLRs are approximated with a linear function. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed decoding algorithm outperforms existing algorithms. Two LLR generation units (LGUs) are proposed to compute LLR vectors for check-to-variable messages, and the two LGUs require only a fraction of the area needed to store n m  LLRs."
2076178,15237,8494,Image forensic of glare feature for improving image retrieval using Benford's Law,2011,"Whilst it is sometimes essential that a scene is well lit before image capture, too much light can cause exposure or glare-based problems. Typically, glare is introduced to images when the camera is pointed towards the light source, and results in a visible distortion in the image. In this paper, we analyse and identify images that contain the ‘glare’ property using the empirical Benford's Law. The experiment is performed on 1338 images, and extracts discrete wavelet High High (HH), High Low (HL) and Low High (LH) sub bands as raw data. The significant digit from each coefficient of all sub bands is then calculated. We then analyse the probability of occurrence of large digits against smaller digits to detect anomalies. All images containing these anomalies are further analysed for the identification of additional salient features. This analysis is performed in accordance with the Benford's Law plot and the help of probability intensity histogram and divergence. Our results indicate that 142 images have irregular Benford's Law curves. For most images, the irregularity occurs at the 5 th  digit. After visual examination, we have found the unbalanced light and high level of brightness in these images. To measure the intensity of light in an image, we compute the probability histogram of gray levels. These results also correlate with the irregular peak identified from the Benford's Law curves. In addition, the divergence is then computed, which shows the deviation between the actual Benford's Law curve and the Benford's Law graph of an image. Our proposed technique is novel and has a potential to be an image forensic tool for quick image analysis."
721067,15237,8500,CMOS capacitive biosensor with enhanced sensitivity for label-free DNA detection,2012,"Silicon devices based on impedance measurements offer label-free and direct electrical detection when used to quantify the hybridization of DNA molecules. They show rapid, robust, and inexpensive measurement and compatibility with commercial microfabrication technology. The real-time measurement of the impedance does not require the use of labeling molecules attached to the target DNA in optical and magnetic technology [1,2]. It also has the advantage of miniaturization for point-of-care (PoC) or on-site sensing applications, unlike the 3-electrode topology in electrochemical sensors [3]. Several studies have proposed capacitive biosensors that utilize a nonfaradaic process, which refers to transient currents charging a geometrical capacitor in an electrolyte-electrode interface [4]. Conventional capacitive biosensors using the excitation of the bidirectional current [5,6] can be implemented with a compact design, but they have several issues that degrade the sensitivity of the sensor, such as DC drift in the electrode caused by a charge imbalance, the electrolysis generated by DC voltage across the electrodes, the offset generated by pre-charged initial values, and weakness against common-mode noise. As a solution, we report a fully integrated capacitance-based biosensor that locates two electrodes differentially in a single current source."
2440089,15237,8500,A 14b extended counting ADC implemented in a 24Mpixel APS-C CMOS image sensor,2012,"The demand for high-quality and high-speed imaging has increased. Column-parallel ≥14b A/D conversion is one of the major approaches to meet these requirements in CMOS image sensors (CIS). Oversampling ADCs such as incremental delta-sigma (I-ΔΣ) ADCs are the solution for a high-resolution ADC having tolerance of analog component errors. Oversampling reduces input temporal noise as well as the quantization error of the ADC itself [1]. However, an I-ΔΣ ADC is also classified as a slow ADC because it requires exponential conversion time to get higher bit resolution. To reduce conversion time, there are two alternative methods: 1) higher-order modulation, and 2) two-step conversion such as an extended-counting technique [2]. In this paper, the extended-counting (EC) method is used since a high-order structure requires more complex hardware and greater power consumption [1,2]. For a general two-step ADC, coarse conversion restricts the total ADC resolution since it determines accuracy of the residue. However, an EC ADC overcomes the accuracy limitation, since the I-ΔΣ can improve its precision through oversampling. Moreover, oversampling also suppresses the noise of the pixel's source follower. Our 14b EC ADC is a blend of a 1 st -order I-ΔΣ ADC and a cyclic ADC to simultaneously get high resolution and high speed."
667681,15237,20649,REGIMap: register-aware application mapping on coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs),2013,"Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs) are an extremely attractive platform when both performance and power efficiency are paramount. Although the power-efficiency of CGRAs can be very high, their performance critically hinges upon the capabilities of the compiler. This is because a CGRA compiler has to perform explicit pipelining, scheduling, placement, and routing of operations. Existing CGRA compilers struggle with two main problems: 1) effectively utilizing the local register files in the PEs, and 2) high compilation times. This paper significantly improves the state-of-the-art in CGRA compilers by first creating a precise and general formulation of the problem of loop mapping on CGRAs, considering the local registers, and from the insights gained from the problem formulation, distilling an efficient and constructive heuristic solution. We show that the mapping problem, once characterized, can be reduced to the problem of finding maximal weighted clique in the product graph of the time-extended CGRA and the data dependence graph of the kernel. The heuristic we've developed results in average of 1.89 X better performance than the state-of-the-art methods when applied to several kernels from multimedia and SPEC2006 benchmarks. A unique feature of our heuristic is that it learns from failed attempts and constructively changes the schedule to achieve better mappings at lower compilation times."
1673347,15237,23593,Accelerating short read mapping on an FPGA (abstract only),2012,"The explosive growth of short read datasets produced by high throughput DNA sequencing technologies poses a challenge to the mapping of short reads to a reference genome in terms of sensitivity and execution speed. Existing methods often use a restrictive error model for computing the alignments to improve speed, whereas more flexible error models are generally too slow for large-scale applications. Although a number of short read mapping software tools have been proposed, designs based on hardware are relatively rare. In this paper, we present a hybrid system for short read mapping utilizing both software and field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware. The compute intensive semi-global alignment operation is accelerated on the FPGA. The proposed FPGA aligner is implemented with a parallel block structure to gain computational efficiency. We also propose a block-wise alignment algorithm to approximate the score of the conventional dynamic programming algorithm. Our performance comparison shows that the FPGA achieves an average speedup of 38 for the alignment operation on a Xilinx Virtex5 FPGA compared to the GASSST software implementation. For the overall execution time, our hybrid system achieves an average speedup of 2.4 compared to GASSST at comparable sensitivity and an average speedup of 1.8 compared to the popular BWA software at a significantly better sensitivity."

The aims of this research are to 1) introduce a dry and wireless EEG system used for conveniently recording EEG signals from forehead regions, 2) propose an effective system for processing EEG recordings and translating them into the vigilance level, and 3) implement the proposed system with a JAVA-based graphical user interface (GUI) for online analysis. To validate the performance of the proposed system, this study recruited eight voluntary subjects to participate a 90-min sustained-attention driving task in a virtual-realistic driving environment. Physiological evidence obtained from the power spectral analysis showed that the dry EEG system could distinguish an alert EEG from a drowsy EEG by evaluating the spectral dynamics of delta and alpha activities. Furthermore, the experimental result of the comparison of the prediction performance using four forehead electrode sites (AF8, FP2, FP1, and AF7) implied that a single-electrode EEG signal used in the mobile and wireless EEG system is able to obtain a high prediction accuracy (~93%). Taken together, the proposed system applied a dry-EEG device combined with an effective algorithm can be a promising technology for real driving applications."
1477816,15237,9772,A body-bias based current sense amplifier for high-speed low-power embedded SRAMs,2014,"Advances in CMOS technology has resulted in ever growing demand in on-chip high-density low-power SRAMs. A miniaturized low voltage-operated SRAM cell ability to generate adequate swing on heavily loaded bitlines is a serious design concern. In addition, Process, Voltage and Temperature variation PVTs in nanometric CMOS regime results in significant SARM cell parameters deviation. Sense amplifier offset voltage is the bottleneck in successful SRAM read operation. Therefore, offset voltage-insensitive current sense amplifiers are usually adopted in high performance SARMs. Read-assist techniques start to merge in the sate-of-the-art high-speed low-power SRAMs. This work presents a new high speed low power current sense amplifier. The proposed scheme utilizes transistor body bias to control the bitlines differential current. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to validate the proposed scheme performance in presence of PVTs variations. Compared to conventional schemes, up to 28% in read failures reduction at 25mV bitlines swing is achieved. In addition, a 41% improvement in speed and up to 2.5X times less bitlines swing requirement at 0.6 V operating voltage is also verified."
706094,15237,20649,Smart hill climbing for agile dynamic mapping in many-core systems,2013,"Stochastic hill climbing algorithm is adapted to rapidly find the appropriate start node in the application mapping of network-based many-core systems. Due to highly dynamic and unpredictable workload of such systems, an agile run-time task allocation scheme is required. The scheme is desired to map the tasks of an incoming application at run-time onto an optimum contiguous area of the available nodes. Contiguous and un-fragmented area mapping is to settle the communicating tasks in close proximity. Hence, the power dissipation, the congestion between different applications, and the latency of the system will be significantly reduced. To find an optimum region, we first propose an approximate model that quickly estimates the available area around a given node. Then the stochastic hill climbing algorithm is used as a search heuristic to find a node that has the required number of available nodes around it. Presented agile climber takes the steps using an adapted version of hill climbing algorithm named  S mart  H ill  C limbing, SHiC, which takes the runtime status of the system into account. Finally, the application mapping is performed starting from the selected first node. Experiments show significant gain in the mapping contiguousness which results in better network latency and power dissipation, compared to state-of-the-art works."
1159686,15237,8335,Hybrid lithography optimization with E-Beam and immersion processes for 16nm 1D gridded design,2012,"Since some of major IC industry participants are moving to the highly regular 1D gridded designs to enable scaling to sub-20nm nodes, how to manufacture the randomly distributed cuts with reasonable throughput and process variation becomes a big challenge. With the help of hybrid lithography, people can apply different types of processes for one single layer manufacturing such that the advantages from different technologies can be combined together to further benefit manufacturing. In this paper, targeting cut printing difficulties and hybrid lithography with electron beam (E-Beam) and 193 nm immersion (193i) processes, we propose a novel algorithm to optimally assign cuts to 193i or E-Beam processes with proper modifications on cut distribution, in order to maximize the overall throughput. To validate our method, we construct our algorithm based on the forbidden patterns obtained from the optical simulation; then we formulate the redistribution problem into a well defined ILP problem and finally call a reliable solver to solve the whole problem. Experimental results show that the throughput is dramatically improved by the cut redistribution. Besides that, for sparser layers, the EBL process can be totaly saved, which largely reduces the fabrication cost."
1034597,15237,8494,Image processing and vision techniques for smart vehicles,2012,"The idea of safe and smart vehicles has been thoroughly researched over the past decades to ensure drivers' safety from possibly dangerous situations. This paper presents a brief review of different applications of image processing and computer vision techniques in smart vehicles. To detect other on-road vehicles, researchers have approached the problem from various angles; with solutions ranging from active sensors like radar to passive sensors like cameras. Recently, researchers are working to create a panoramic 360 degree view of the vehicle's environment by merging different images from sides, rear and front of the car using passive sensors. There has also been work on constructing high resolution images from low cost, low resolution cameras, in order to reduce final cost of the system. In this paper, we have presented a new algorithm for mono-camera based vehicle detection systems, by incorporating different low level (edges) and high level features (Bag-of-features). To extract edge information flawlessly, we presented a new edge detection method, namely Difference of BiGaussian (DoBG). Experimental results show average 98.5% recognition rates, which is one of the best results achieved so far."
1905049,15237,8500,A 12.5+12.5 Gb/s Full-Duplex Plastic Waveguide Interconnect,2011,"A new interconnect solution with plastic waveguide is demonstrated. The system consists of a pair of transceivers and a plastic waveguide. Millimeter wave signal is transmitted in a low-cost long piece of solid plastic dielectric acting as a waveguide. The plastic waveguide medium offers a large bandwidth for data communication using mm-wave carrier frequencies. Plastic waveguide interconnects do not require costly electrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical conversion devices or precise alignment and offer longer transmission distances than wireless solutions due to better field confinement and lower path loss. Multiple plastic waveguides can be used in parallel and the modulated data at different frequencies can be multiplexed to increase the data rate. The demonstrated transceiver chips operate at carrier frequencies of 57 GHz and 80 GHz, and are fabricated in 40 nm low-power logic CMOS. The total area and power consumption of two transceivers are 0.41 mm 2  and 140 mW, respectively. The fabricated demonstrator with Yagi-couplers achieves full-duplex transmission of 12.5 Gb/s ASK modulated signal in each direction over the 120 mm polystyrene waveguide with no equalization. The observed bit error rates for both channels are less than 10 -12  for a PRBS length of 2 7 -1 at the total data rate of 25 Gb/s. This paper shows the feasibility of the plastic waveguide interconnect as a promising alternative to electrical, optical, and wireless interconnects."
822129,15237,8500,"Active feedback receiver with integrated tunable RF channel selectivity, distortion cancelling, 48dB stopband rejection and >+12dBm wideband IIP3, occupying 2 in 65nm CMOS",2012,"The impedance transformation property of passive mixers enables integrated high-Q channel selection at RF with a programmable center frequency through a clock [1,2]. As such, this technique is suitable for addressing both linearity and flexibility requirements in wideband and cognitive radio applications. However, given the typically low resistance level at the RF side of the receiver chain, the RC product necessary for filtering results in large capacitors, and, consequently, large die area that does not scale with technology. In addition, filter rejection at the RF side is limited by the resistance of the switches of the passive mixer. Thus, large switches are typically needed for moderate rejection values (5Ω switches for 16dB rejection [2]), which translates to higher power consumption in the LO buffers. Furthermore, filtering prior to the LNA [1] or eliminating it altogether [3] improves linearity at the expense of noise and switching harmonics being injected directly at the antenna node. Conversely, an LNA first architecture offers an opposite trade-off. This work demonstrates a highly compact design of a direct-conversion receiver with an active feedback frequency translation loop to perform channel selection at the LNA output while simultaneously cancelling its distortion."
1830559,15237,20649,Ultra-Low Power Design of Wearable Cardiac Monitoring Systems,2014,"This paper presents the system-level architecture of novel ultra-low power wireless body sensor nodes (WBSNs) for real-time cardiac monitoring and analysis, and discusses the main design challenges of this new generation of medical devices. In particular, it highlights first the unsustainable energy cost incurred by the straightforward wireless streaming of raw data to external analysis servers. Then, it introduces the need for new cross-layered design methods (beyond hardware and software boundaries) to enhance the autonomy of WBSNs for ambulatory monitoring. In fact, by embedding more onboard intelligence and exploiting electrocardiogram (ECG) specific knowledge, it is possible to perform real-time compressive sensing, filtering, delineation and classification of heartbeats, while dramatically extending the battery lifetime of cardiac monitoring systems. The paper concludes by showing the results of this new approach to design ultra-low power wearable WBSNs in a real-life platform commercialized by SmartCardia. This wearable system allows a wide range of applications, including multi-lead ECG arrhythmia detection and autonomous sleep monitoring for critical scenarios, such as monitoring of the sleep state of airline pilots."
2203646,15237,23907,A broadband biosensor interface IC for miniaturized dielectric spectroscopy from MHz to GHz,2013,"This paper describes a broadband biosensor interface IC as part of a miniaturized measurement platform currently under development for MHz-to-GHz dielectric spectroscopy (DS). Developed in 0.35μm 2P/4M RF CMOS, the IC measures the frequency-dependent S 21  magnitude and phase of a microfabricated microfluidic dielectric sensor, when the sensor is loaded with a solution-under-test (SUT). The IC architecture implements a modified frequency response analysis (FRA) method by first down-converting the biosensor response signal from the RF excitation frequency to an intermediate frequency (IF) of 1MHz using an LNA and active mixer, followed by down-converting the IF signal to dc using a coherent detector employing IF amplification stages with programmable gain, a passive mixer driven by in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) signals, and an active-RC lowpass filter (LPF). Dielectric readings of ethanol from the biosensor interfaced with the IC at five excitation frequencies in the range of 50MHz to 2GHz are in excellent agreement (error <; 1%) with those from using a vector network analyzer (VNA) as the sensor readout. A reference measurement by an Agilent 85070E dielectric probe kit is also included to show proof-of-concept feasibility in miniaturization."
2290142,15237,8500,A 0.54 pJ/b 20 Gb/s Ground-Referenced Single-Ended Short-Reach Serial Link in 28 nm CMOS for Advanced Packaging Applications,2013,"High-speed signaling over high density interconnect on organic package substrates or silicon interposers offers an attractive solution to the off-chip bandwidth limitation problem faced in modern digital systems. In this paper, we describe a signaling system co-designed with the interconnect to take advantage of the characteristics of this environment to enable a high-speed, low area, and low-power die to die link. Ground-Referenced Signaling (GRS) is a single-ended signaling system that eliminates the major problems traditionally associated with single-ended design by using the ground plane as the reference and signaling above and below ground. This design employs a novel charge pump driver that additionally eliminates the issue of simultaneous switching noise with data independent current consumption. Silicon measurements from a test chip implementing two 16-lane links, with forwarded clocks, in a standard 28 nm process demonstrate 20 Gb/s operation at 0.54 pJ/bit over 4.5 mm organic substrate channels at a nominal 0.9 V power supply voltage. Timing margins at the receiver are >0.3 UI at a BER of 10 -12 . We estimate BER 10 -25  at the eye center."
1574568,15237,8500,A 1024×8 700ps time-gated SPAD line sensor for laser raman spectroscopy and LIBS in space and rover-based planetary exploration,2013,"In this paper, we present an all-digital, 1024x8, time-resolved SPAD line sensor designed for time-resolved laser Raman spectroscopy and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The block diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 6.7.1. The sensor consists of 16 groups of 64x8 SPAD arrays with fast readout interface electronics. The SPAD gate width and its delay are controlled by a combination of off-chip (Maxim DS1020, 1ns/tap) and on-chip delay lines (250ps/tap) resulting in a temporal resolution of 250ps through typical scan ranges of 32ns. Properly balanced binary trees allow less than 98.5ps skew variation across the entire chip. The proposed line sensor has a fill factor of 44.3% with a photon detection probability (PDP) of 21% at 475nm at an excess bias of 3.5V. The 24.6mm long focal plane matches the format of a typical detector that would be used at the output of a Raman spectrometer (e.g. CCD), allowing the observation of the entire Raman spectrum without the use of any moving parts, thus reducing complexity, overall power consumption, and weight."
2338910,15237,8500,A fully-integrated 3-level DC/DC converter for nanosecond-scale DVS with fast shunt regulation,2011,"In recent years, chip multiprocessor architectures have emerged to scale performance while staying within tight power constraints. This trend motivates per-core/block dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) with fast voltage transition. Given the high cost and bulk of off-chip DC/DC converters to implement multiple on-chip power domains, there has been a surge of interest in on-chip converters. This paper presents the design and experimental results of a fully integrated 3-level DC/DC converter [1] that merges characteristics of both inductor-based buck [2–4] and switched-capacitor (SC) converters [5]. While off-chip buck converters show high conversion efficiency, their on-chip counterparts suffer from loss due to low quality inductors. With the help of flying capacitors, the 3-level converter requires smaller inductors than the buck converter, reducing loss and on-die area overhead. Compared to SC converters that need more complex structures to regulate higher than half the input voltage, 3-level converters can efficiently regulate the output voltage across a wide range of levels and load currents. Measured results from a 130nm CMOS test-chip prototype demonstrate nanosecond-scale voltage transition times and peak conversion efficiency of 77%."
2156255,15237,8494,Novel integration technologies for improving reliability in NAND flash memory,2012,"NAND flash has been scaled down intensively to 2Y nm generation to satisfy the increasing demand for high-density memories. However, as technology node advances, various scaling barriers newly appeared and reliability characteristics of NAND flash such as endurance and data retention deteriorated. Maximum Vth of a programmed cell becomes lower with scaling down, resulting in insufficient program window for MLC operation. Floating gate (FG) and inter-poly dielectric (IPD) structure must be carefully optimized to maximize saturated level of programmed Vth. The tight control of Vth distribution is one of the main issues in scaling for reliability margin. By decreasing depletion in floating gate and control gate (CG), widening of cell Vth distribution width can be efficiently suppressed. The effect of traps in gate oxide to reliability increases with the decrease in cell dimension. To lower interface trap of gate oxide, hydrogen reducing back-end-of line (BEOL) process is introduced. By using new BEOL process, endurance and data retention characteristics are drastically enhanced. In this paper, we will present the major scaling issues and integration technologies for improving reliability in NAND flash memory for 2Ynm generation and beyond."
1513352,15237,8494,A 5-10GHz low power bang-bang all digital PLL based on programmable digital loop filter,2012,"This paper presents the design and the implementation of a low power bang-bang all digital phase locked loop (BBADPLL). The design of the proposed architecture is based on the programmable coefficients of the digital loop filter (DLF) that manages the tradeoffs between stability and jitter of a closed loop. A proposed simple digital controlled oscillator (DCO) based on three stages ring oscillator provides a wide frequency range, and proven to be of lower area and power compared to arrayed DCO. The proposed design results in a significant reduction in the area and power compared to other time-to-digital converter (TDC) based ADPLL architectures. This reduction results from eliminating the need for complex, power, and area consuming TDC block, and arrayed DCO. A counter-based frequency acquisition loop using a binary search algorithm reduced the lock-in time significantly compared to similar work. The proposed BBADPLL architecture was implemented on TSMC CMOS 65nm technology with a frequency range 5–10GHz and a frequency resolution equals to 500MHz. The lock-in time is 2.4µs. The peak-to-peak period jitter and the RMS jitter at 10GHz are 1.49ps and 0.19ps, respectively. The total power consumed at 10GHz is only 2.7mWatt and the total area of the proposed ADPLL is 4372µm 2 , which is very small compared to other published architectures."
1051954,15237,8500,A 37.6mm 2 1024-channel high-compliance-voltage SoC for epiretinal prostheses,2013,"Retinal implants elicit light perception for people blinded by photoreceptor loss. Commercialized 60-channel retinal prostheses allow patients to perform simple tasks, but several hundreds to a thousand electrodes are required for face recognition/reading [1,2], posing great challenges for the design of next-generation retinal stimulators. Aside from the higher power/data demand, the electrode impedance is also increased. Placing 1000 epiretinal electrodes in the 5mm-diameter macula region reduces the electrode size to less than 0.01mm 2 , leading to a 30kΩ electrode-tissue impedance [2]. To elicit light perception of various brightness levels, the stimulators for epiretinal prostheses require an output compliance voltage of ±10V [3], thus requiring area-consuming high-voltage (HV) transistors. The stimulator in [4] achieves 1600 channels, but it is designed for subretinal rather than epiretinal prostheses. It has ±2V compliance and needs a separate chip for power telemetry. For epiretinal prostheses, an HV-compliant 1024-channel stimulator in [3] is estimated to occupy 64mm 2  and requires off-chip diodes for power rectification. For a space-restricted retinal implant, a small-sized fully integrated SoC with minimal number of off-chip components is preferred."
1322658,15237,8494,SRAM in hold-operation: Modeling the interaction of soft-errors and switching power-supply noise,2012,"SRAM failure-rate, induced by failure mechanisms such as process variations or cosmic neutrons, increases with reduction in the supply-voltage. Thus, appropriate supply-voltage margins must be used to mitigate or control the failure-rate. This work models and analyzes the interaction of two failure-mechanisms in an SRAM cell during the hold-operation (standby): (i) power-supply noise (due to switching at clock-edge) and soft-errors (due to radioactivity). Circuit-level simulations are used to analyze this interaction. The effect of random process-variations is accounted for by Monte-Carlo simulations. An error in stored-bit of SRAM cell is a transient phenomenon. Therefore, transient analysis of soft-error is carried out in the presence of power-supply noise and random process-variations by using circuit-level simulations in the UMC CMOS 90nm technology. A stochastic process based supply-voltage is difficult to model; therefore, a lower-envelope of measured supply-voltage from the literature is used as the noisy waveform. The critical-charge, obtained by using injection-current model of Freeman [1], of an SRAM cell is used to calculate the soft-error rate (SER). Simulation results show that the SER depends on the time-average of the noisy supply-voltage and not on its minimum value. The distribution of critical-charge, due to random process-variations, is estimated using simulations."
1508829,15237,23907,A 10-MHz bandwidth 70-dB SNDR 640MS/s continuous-time ΣΔ ADC using Gm-C filter with nonlinear feedback DAC calibration,2013,"So far almost all wide-band (>10MHz) continuous-time ΣΔ ADCs use active-RC filters. Although this type of filter possesses excellent linearity, it behaves as a resistive load for the preceding stage, which requires a signal buffer. For high speed and high resolution applications, a low noise and low distortion signal buffer consumes quite large power. Gm-C filters have small capacitive loads, which avoids the need of a signal buffer. As a result, the ADC could achieve better power efficiency. However, due to the poor linearity, previous ΣΔ ADCs with Gm-C filters have low SNDR. In this work, the first Gm cell's nonlinearity is calibrated by a nonlinear feedback DAC. The principle of the novel compensation technique is that transfer functions of the Gm cell and the feedback DAC match each other so that the DAC has the same nonlinearity as the first Gm cell. Therefore the distortion is removed at the output. The concept is implemented in a 640MS/s CT EAADC for 10MHz signal bandwidth in a 0.18-μm CMOS process. After calibration, the modulator achieves 77/76/70dB DR/SNR/SNDR with 60mW power. The SNDR and power efficiency are much improved compared to previous ΣΔ ADCs with Gm-C filters. Without the power-hungry signal buffer, this novel on-chip calibration technique enables Gm-C-based ΣΔ ADC with similar SNDR and power efficiency as active-RC-based ΣΔ ADCs."
1599342,15237,8494,Advances in non-radiative resonant inductive coupling wireless Power Transfer: A comparison of alternative circuit and system models driven by emergent applications,2014,"Recent research in wireless power transfer (WPT) using resonant inductive coupling has demonstrated very high efficiencies at large distances compared to the transmitting element dimensions, thereby increasing the number of potential applications of WPT. Since resonant inductive coupling is a very multidisciplinary field of research, different approaches have been proposed to predict the behaviour of these systems from the physical theory of resonators (coupled-mode theory) and circuit theory. Although the equivalence of these models for a point-to-point link has already been studied together with the performance metrics Power Transferred to the Load (PTL) and Power Transfer Efficiency (PTE), the new challenges and applications of this technology emphasize the necessity of analytical models to predict and assess the behavior of Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MIMO) links. In this article we revisit the current analytical models from the MIMO perspective, derive the analytical equations for the equivalent performance metrics PTE and PTL and demonstrate how to maximize them in a non-radiative resonant wireless power transfer link from a circuit-centric point of view, providing design guidelines in terms of optimal source and load impedances. This work concludes with a prospective discussion on open challenges of WPT. © 2014 IEEE."
1423370,15237,8228,UWB radio channel characterization and design for intra spacecraft communication,2013,"ESA is investigating wireless cable replacement for intra-spacecraft (IS) applications to reduce cable weight, and add flexibility to the subsystem layout. The low emission limit and robustness to highly reflective environments make UWB a potential candidate for cable replacement. Therefore, to validate these assumptions, channel measurements have been conducted in a representative spacecraft; the ESA Venus Express mock-up, which is divided in separate compartments/cavities connected by openings. Channel measurements that cover the entire 3 to 10 GHz UWB spectrum, are conducted for all cavity combinations of the Venus Express. Channel statistics are derived from the measurements. Moreover, the raw channel measurements are used in a hardware-true physical layer (PHY) simulator, based on current Holst Centre - IMEC UWB hardware platform supporting IEEE 802.15.4a standard. The used hardware specification are from the non-coherent setting, employing power detection and integrate and dump in RX for easy synchronization in a highly reflective environment, insensitivity to clock jitter, and robustness against clock offsets at cost of reduced sensitivity. The PHY results correspond well to the outage probability derived from the channel measurements when taking the actual noncoherent setting receiver hardware sensitivity into account. Since most power is in the scattered power, the most dominating factor in IS UWB communication is not the actual position or distance between the antennas, but the minimum number of openings between the cavities. The low mean loss of the measured radio channel combined with the immunity of the UWB air-interface to small-scale-fading, ensures that the signal is always well above the noise floor of the non-coherent setting of the current Holst Centre - IMEC hardware."
1162413,15237,8335,EUV lithography: prospects and challenges,2011,"Integrated circuit scaling as codified in Moore's Law has been enabled through the tremendous advances in lithographic patterning technology over multiple process generations. Optical lithography has been the mainstay of patterning technology to date. Its imminent demise has been oft proclaimed over the years but clever engineering has consistently been able to extend it through many lens size and wavelength changes. NA has increased steadily from about 0.3 to 1.35 today with improvements in lens design and the use of immersion lithography. Simultaneously, the illumination wavelength has been reduced from 436nm about 20 years ago to 193nm for state-of-the-art scanners today. However, this approach has reached its limits. The 22nm technology node, targeted for HVM in 2011, represents the last instance of using standard 1.35NA immersion lithography-based patterning for the critical layers with a  k  1  hovering right around the 0.3 value that is considered acceptable for manufacturability. For the 14nm node with a HVM date of 2013, one has to resort to double patterning to achieve a manufacturable  k  1 .   For the 10nm technology node with a 2015 HVM date, double patterning will also be insufficient. While further ArF extension schemes are being considered, the industry is working towards lowering the wavelength from 193nm to Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography with a λ of 13.5nm. EUV offers the prospect of operating at significantly higher  k  1  and as a consequence, much simpler design rules and potentially simpler OPC. However, the technical challenges are formidable. EUV lithography requires the re-engineering of every subsystem in the optical path --- source, collector and projection optics, reticles and photoresists. A huge industry-wide effort is under way to solve these technical issues and bring 13.5nm EUV lithography to production.   Two main approaches are being considered for EUV sources --- Laser Produced Plasma (LPP) and Discharge Produced Plasma (DPP). Both approaches appear to be heading towards production and it remains to be seen if one approach is more scalable to higher power levels. Currently however, neither approach is close to the power levels required to deliver runrates that will have a reasonable Cost of Ownership (COO). Clearly, a lot of development is ahead to make this happen.   Photoresists have also seen a significant amount of technical development, primarily using small field Micro Exposure Tools (MET). Photoresist companies are working on developing the chemical platforms needed for EUV photoresists. While much progress has been made on photospeed, resolution and linewidth roughness, further improvements are required to meet the needs of the 14nm and 10nm process nodes.   Since EUV employs reflective optics, EUV reticles are reflective as well and this poses several challenges. Apart from the obvious complexities of EUV reticle manufacturing, defectivity is a major concern, both from the standpoint of making defect-free masks as well as from the requirement of detecting the defects and repairing them. A significant industry-wide effort is being driven both among individual companies and through consortia like SEMATECH to develop both the manufacturing techniques required to make high-quality masks and the inspection and repair capabilities needed.   Probably the most complex technical challenge and one largely untested in an HVM sense is the scanner itself. The current state of the art is the ASML Alpha Demo Tool (ADT) currently in use at SEMATECH and IMEC. This 0.25NA tool has a low runrate and limited technical capabilities but can print full fields and has been a valuable tool in the early demonstration of integrated device and circuit fabrication using EUV lithography. Working SRAM cells and other circuits have been demonstrated with very promising results. The first development-quality EUV scanners are targeted to ship to end users in 2011, while the HVM versions with high targeted runrates and low targeted COO are slated for delivery beginning in mid-2012. The delivery of these tools at the end users' fab and their subsequent integration into the process flow will pose the greatest challenge and is expected to require a significant outlay of engineering effort and resources in the next 2 years.   EUV presents its own challenges in terms of non-idealities that would need to be quantified and corrected for. While conventional OPC may be minimal, EUV has other sources of variability including flare and mask shadowing that would need to be compensated for. Moreover, the likelihood of defects on EUV masks brings up the possibility of pattern shifting to place the defects in benign areas of the reticle. All of these new challenges require OPC, synthesis or other data manipulation methodologies to be developed for EUV.   This paper will attempt to highlight the key technical challenges of EUV lithography and where the industry will need to focus its efforts over the next 2 years to make EUV manufacturing successful and cost-effective."

We have already proposed a new nanodisk array structure for generating PSPs using delay in electron hopping among nanodisks. Generated PSPs have fluctuation caused by stochastic electron movement. Noise or fluctuation is effectively used in neural processing. In this paper, we review our proposed structure and show fluctuation controllability based on single-electron circuit simulation."

2273418,15237,8335,On error tolerance and Engineering Change with Partially Programmable Circuits,2012,"The growing size, density and complexity of modern VLSI chips are contributing to an increase in hardware faults and design errors in the silicon, decreasing manufacturing yield and increasing the design cycle. The use of Partially Programmable Circuits (PPCs) has been recently proposed for yield enhancement with very small overhead. This new circuit structure is obtained from conventional logic by replacing some subcircuits with programmable LUTs. The present paper lays the theoretical groundwork for evaluating PPCs with Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) satisfiability. First, QBF models are constructed to calculate the fault tolerance and design error tolerance of a PPC, namely the percentages of faults and design errors that can be masked using LUT reconfigurations. Next, zero-cost Engineering Change Order (ECO) in PPCs is investigated. QBF formulations are given for performing ECOs, and for quantifying the ECO coverage of a PPC architecture. Experimental results are presented evaluating PPCs from [1], demonstrating the applicability and accuracy of the proposed formulations."
2441438,15237,8335,Parallel statistical capacitance extraction of on-chip interconnects with an improved geometric variation model,2011,"In this paper, a new geometric variation model, referred to as the improved continuous surface variation (ICSV) model, is proposed to accurately imitate the random variation of on-chip interconnects. In addition, a new statistical capacitance solver is implemented to incorporate the ICSV model, the HPC [5] and weighted PFA [6] techniques. The solver also employs a parallel computing technique to greatly improve its efficiency. Experiments show that on a typical 65nm-technology structure, ICSV model has significant advantage over other existing models, and the new solver is at least 10X faster than the MC simulation with 10000 samples. The parallel solver achieves 7X further speedup on an 8-core machine. We conclude this paper with several criteria to discuss the trade-off between different geometric models and statistical methods for different scenarios."
1398297,15237,8335,Memory access reconstruction based on memory allocation mechanism for source-level simulation of embedded software,2013,"To date, there still lacks a way to accurately simulate data memory accesses in source-level simulation (SLS) of host-compiled embedded SW. The difficulty lies in that the accessed addresses for the load and store instructions can not be statically determined. Without knowing those addresses, the source code can not be annotated appropriately for data cache simulation. In this paper, we show an approach that is capable of resolving the accessed memory addresses based on the memory allocation mechanism. Applying this approach, the source code can be annotated to perform precise data cache simulation. The novelty of our methodology is that it is the first of its kind to take the memory allocation mechanism into account and thus can handle all the stack, data, heap and text sections. Moreover, a method is also proposed to handle pointer dereferences. In experiments, SLS with our approach yields almost identical cache miss rate and pattern when compared to the reference simulation."
1220384,15237,8335,On-chip statistical hot-spot estimation using mixed-mesh statistical polynomial expression generating and skew-normal based moment matching techniques,2012,"This work introduces the concept of thermal yield profile for the hot-spot identification with considering process variations and provides an efficient estimating technique for the thermal yield profile. After executing a mixed-mesh strategy for generating statistical polynomial expression of the on-chip temperature distribution, the thermal yield profile is obtained by a skew-normal based moment matching technique. Comparing with the Monte Carlo method, experimental results demonstrate that our method can efficiently and accurately estimate the thermal yield profile. With the same level of accuracy, our skew-normal based method achieves 215x speedup over the state of the art, APEX [1], for estimating the thermal yield profile. Moreover, results show that our mixed-mesh statistical polynomial expression generator achieves 130x speedup over the statistical collocation based method [2] and still accurately estimates the thermal yield profile."
1297173,15237,8335,Adaptive interpolation-based model checking,2014,"Interpolation-based model checking (IMC) is an important technique in modern formal verification tools. In essence, it relies on an abstraction and refinement process to derive an adequate image approximation for the reachability analysis. However, previous IMC algorithms only offer fixed degrees of abstraction and thus may fail in the proofs if the abstraction is too coarse- or fine-grained. In this paper, we propose an adaptive interpolation-based model checking algorithm in which the degree of abstraction can be adjusted on demand. That is, during the proof process, we closely monitor the effectiveness of the interpolation-based over-approximated image computation and thus adjust the degree of abstraction for the best performance. The experimental results confirm that our flexible interpolation indeed leads to an adequate degree of abstraction as our IMC algorithm outperforms previous ones in various aspects."

This requires a generalized form of communication coalescing where data can be transferred from the external memory even when this memory is not fully up-to-date. Experiments with Altera HLS tools demonstrate that this automatization, based on advanced polyhedral code analysis and code generation techniques, can be used to efficiently map C kernels to FPGA, by generating, entirely at C level, all the necessary glue (the communication processes), which is compiled with the same HLS tool as for the computation kernel."

Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed techniques for more accurate system performance estimation."
963359,15237,8235,How to partition a billion-node graph,2014,"Billion-node graphs pose significant challenges at all levels from storage infrastructures to programming models. It is critical to develop a general purpose platform for graph processing. A distributed memory system is considered a feasible platform supporting online query processing as well as offline graph analytics. In this paper, we study the problem of partitioning a billion-node graph on such a platform, an important consideration because it has direct impact on load balancing and communication overhead. It is challenging not just because the graph is large, but because we can no longer assume that the data can be organized in arbitrary ways to maximize the performance of the partitioning algorithm. Instead, the algorithm must adopt the same data and programming model adopted by the system and other applications. In this paper, we propose a multi-level label propagation (MLP) method for graph partitioning. Experimental results show that our solution can partition billion-node graphs within several hours on a distributed memory system consisting of merely several machines, and the quality of the partitions produced by our approach is comparable to state-of-the-art approaches applied on toy-size graphs."
1621808,15237,8335,Provably optimal test cube generation using quantified boolean formula solving,2013,"Circuits that employ test pattern compression rely on test cubes to achieve high compression ratios. The less inputs of a test pattern are specified, the better it can be compacted and hence the lower the test application time. Although there exist previous approaches to generate such test cubes, none of them are optimal. We present for the first time a framework that yields provably optimal test cubes by using the theory of quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). Extensive comparisons with previous methods demonstrate the quality gain of the proposed method."
1807060,15237,8335,Cut-demand based routing resource allocation and consolidation for routability enhancement,2011,"To successfully route a design, one essential requirement is to allocate sufficient routing resources. In this paper, we show that allocating routing resources based on horizontal and vertical (H/V) cut-demands can greatly improve routability especially for designs with thin areas. We then derive methods to predict the maximum H/V cut-demands and propose two cut-demand based approaches, one is to allocate routing resources considering the maximum H/V cut-demands and the other is to consolidate fragmented metal-1 routing resources for effective resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that the resource allocation method can precisely determine design areas and the resource consolidation method can significantly improve routability. With better routability, the routing time is about 5 times faster on average and the design area can be further reduced by 2--15%."
2264264,15237,8335,Fault diagnosis aware ATE assisted test response compaction,2011,"Recently a new method called ATE assisted compaction for achieving test response compaction has been proposed. The method relies on testers to achieve additional compaction, without compromising fault coverage, beyond what may already be achieved using on-chip response compactors. The method does not add additional logic or modify the circuit under test or require additional tests and thus can be used with any design including legacy designs. In this work, we enhance this method so that the level of diagnostic resolution achieved without it can be maintained. Experimental results on larger ISCAS-89 show that additional test response compaction can be achieved while diagnostic resolution for single and double stuck-at faults is not adversely impacted by the procedure."

We address the problem of application level (i.e., both task- and network-level) schedule synthesis and optimization. In this context, most of the recent works [10], [11] either focus on communication schedule or consider a simplified task model. In this work, we formulate the co-synthesis problem of task and communication schedules as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model taking into account a number of Ethernet-specific timing parameters such as interframe gap, precision and synchronization error. Our formulation is able to handle one or multiple timing objectives such as application response time, end-to-end delay and their combinations. We show the applicability of our formulation considering an industrial size case study using a number of different sets of objectives. Further, we show that our formulation scales to systems with reasonably large size."
1233621,15237,8335,A novel wirelength-driven packing algorithm for FPGAs with adaptive logic modules,2014,"Adaptive logic module (ALM) in modern field programmable gate array can serve as one 6-input lookup table (LUT) or two smaller lookup tables under certain constraints. In a typical design flow, a netlist of LUTs formed after technology mapping has to be merged into ALMs and then packed into coarse-grained logic blocks (CLBs) before placement and routing. How the LUTs are merged and the ALMs are packed has a significant impact on the quality of the placement. We propose a novel wirelength-driven algorithm to merge the LUTs and pack the ALMs to ensure that it will not adversely affect the final wire-length. Experimental results show that substituting AAPack [8] by our algorithm yields about 14.54% reduction in number of tracks required for routing and 17.97% wirelength improvement for ALM-based FPGA. Applying our algorithm to traditional FPGA, the minimum channel width and wirelength are reduced by 16.59% and 17.57%, respectively, compared to T-VPack."

A key step in the design process is the root-cause analysis of detected errors. Debugging may take months to close, introduce high cost and uncertainty ultimately jeopardizing the chip release date.

Our multi-Vdd variable pipeline router adjusts its pipeline depth (i.e., communication latency) and supply voltage level in response to the applied workload. Unlike dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) routers, the operating frequency is the same for all routers throughout the CMP; thus, there is no need to synchronize neighboring routers working at different frequencies. In this paper, we implemented the multi-Vdd variable pipeline router, which selects two supply voltage levels and pipeline modes, using a 65nm CMOS process and evaluated it using a full-system CMP simulator. Evaluation results show that although the application performance degraded by 1.0% to 2.1%, the standby power of NoCs reduced by 10.4% to 44.4%."
1197973,15237,30,Multi-sparse signal recovery for compressive sensing,2012,"Signal recovery is one of the key techniques of compressive sensing (CS). It reconstructs the original signal from the linear sub-Nyquist measurements. Classical methods exploit the sparsity in one domain to formulate the L0 norm optimization. Recent investigation shows that some signals are sparse in multiple domains. To further improve the signal reconstruction performance, we can exploit this multi-sparsity to generate a new convex programming model. The latter is formulated with multiple sparsity constraints in multiple domains and the linear measurement fitting constraint. It improves signal recovery performance by additional a priori information. Since some EMG signals exhibit sparsity both in time and frequency domains, we take them as example in numerical experiments. Results show that the newly proposed method achieves better performance for multi-sparse signals."

In the past, FIR filters were implemented by conventional number system; therefore, the speed was limited due to the multiply accumulate operations. We realize a fast FIR filter by utilizing the Logarithmic Number System, which allows simple implementation of multiplication using a fixed-point adder. And the serious demerit of Logarithmic Number System's algorithm, conversions to and from the conventional number representations is effectively overcome by utilizing our pipeline architecture, so the delay and complexity of the filter is reduced. The critical path was reduced from a multiply-accumulate operation to an adder operation, and our FIR filter can operate at 1.3G Hz under the condition of 1.2 V power supply using SMIC 0.13um CMOS technology, and requires approximate 27 percent lesser area than the original FIR filter."

In this periodic and deterministic switch, only two DFFs are used to implement a pattern generator which is a  O ( N  3 ) hardware complexity in traditional matching algorithm based  N x N  switch. For packet reordering, a feedback path is established in series of symmetric patterns. As comparing with commercial switch systems, we implement a 4x4 switch IC directly in high speed domain without the use of SERDES interfaces to achieve low propagation delay and high scalability. In CML output buffer, PMOS active load and active back-end termination are introduced. A stacked current source and symmetric topology in CML-DFF are adopted.

However, for multi-layer dielectrics in VLSI technology, the efficiency of FRW algorithm would be degraded due to frequent stop of walks at dielectric interface and constraint of first-hop length especially in thin dielectrics. In this paper, we tackle these problems with the numerical characterization of Green??s function for cross-interface transition probabilities and the corresponding weight value. We also present a space management technique with Octree data structure to reduce the time of each hop and parallelize the whole FRW by multi-threaded programming.

The first one is a virtual Gaussian surface sampling technique. It makes efficient random sampling on the Gaussian surface for complex nets with vias, and optimizes the sampling scheme to reduce the time of random walk. The other one is a parallelized, improved construction approach for Octree based space management structure. It can be over 5000X faster than the existing approach and provides same convenience to the FRW procedure. Numerical experiments on large cases with up to half million conductors validate the proposed techniques, and demonstrate a fast FRW solver for chip-scale extraction task."

In CP exposure of VIA layers, higher throughput is realized if more VIAs are exposed in each EB shot, but it will result in huge number of VIA characters required for arbitrary VIA placement. We adopt one-dimensional VIA array as the basic CP character architecture to increase VIA numbers in an EB shot while saving the stencil area by superposed character arrangement. CP throughput is further improved by layout constraints for VIA placement in detail routing phase. Our experimental results give estimated EB shot counts less than 174G shot/wafer in 14nm technologies."

The idea is to exploit the multi antennas at the transmitter to superimpose a space-time varying interfering component (at the modulation rate) while staying orthogonal to the desired receiver's direction. Unlike conventional interference or artificial noise injection techniques, the proposed approach impedes an arbitrary eavesdropper from blindly separating the information data symbols from the injected interference due to its space-time varying nature."

2327974,15237,8335,A robust ECO engine by resource-constraint-aware technology mapping and incremental routing optimization,2011,"ECO re-mapping is a key step in functional ECO tools. It implements a given patch function on a layout database with a limited spare cell resource. Previous ECO re-mapping algorithms are based on existing technology mappers. However, these mappers are not designed to consider the resource limitation and thus the corresponding ECO results are generally not good enough, or even become much worse when the spare cells are sparse. In this paper, we proposed a new solution for ECO remapping. It includes a robust resource-constraint-aware technology mapper and a fast incremental router for wire-length optimization. Moreover, we adopt a Pseudo-Boolean solver to search feasible solutions when the spare cells are sparse. Our experimental results show that our ECO engine can outperform the previous tool in both runtime and routing costs.

To date, researchers have used dedicated hardware such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to address the performance-critical aspects of the channelizer. In this work, we assess the viability of the graphics processing unit (GPU) to achieve the necessary performance. In particular, we focus on the fast Fourier Transform (FFT) stage of a wideband channelizer. While there exists previous work for FFT on a NVIDIA GPU, the substantially higher peak floating-point performance of an AMD GPU has been less explored. Thus, we consider three generations of AMD GPUs and provide insight into the optimization of FFT on these platforms. Our architecture-aware approach across three different generations of AMD GPUs outperforms a multithreaded Intel Sandy Bridge CPU with vector extensions by factors of 4.3, 4.9, and 6.6 on the Radeon HD 5870, 6970, and 7970, respectively."

To enable the deployment of real-time applications to priority-aware networks, recent research proposes worst-case latency (WCL) analyses for such networks. Buffer space requirements in priority-aware networks, however, are seldom addressed. In this work, we bound the buffer space required for valid WCL analyses and consequently optimize router design for application specifications by computing the required buffer space at each virtual channel in priority-aware routers. In addition to the obvious advantage of bounding buffer space while providing valid WCL bounds, buffer space reduction decreases chip area and saves energy in priority-aware networks. Our experiments show that the proposed buffer space computation reduces the number of unfeasible implementations by 42% compared to an existing buffer space analysis technique. It also reduces the required buffer space in priority-aware routers by up to 79%."
2363222,15237,369,Adaptive Compressive Sampling for Wideband Signals,2011,"In traditional compressive sampling approach, it's always assumed the sparsity of a signal is known. However, we always can't get this in Cognitive Radio (CR) network. This makes a great barrier to the practical usage of compressive sampling. This paper develops an Adaptive Compressive Sampling (ACS) approach for wideband signals. It doesn't need the sparsity as a priori knowledge. Also, once the sparsity changes, it can adaptively change the proper sampling rate through comparing the different results recovered by different sampling rates. When there is no difference between the results recovered by two different sampling rates, the smaller sampling rate of these two is the proper sampling rate to recover the original information of the signal exactly. Moreover, ACS can provide the unoccupied spectrum holes to Secondary Users (SU) in CR for dynamic spectrum access."

The key idea is adapted from Angluin's DFA (deterministic finite automata) learning algorithm [1] that learns a DFA from another DFA. Several key components of Angluin's algorithm are modified so that it fits in our problem setting, and the modified algorithm also provides a reasonable partitioning of the continuous state space as a by-product.

To address these problems, we propose an on-chip circuitry named DSC (Dynamic Slicing Circuit) which outputs the input signal values that actually influence on an erroneous output value in a particular execution of a chip by analyzing dependencies among signals. Since such input signal values are usually a small subset of the entire input sequence, we can reproduce the error by simulation using them. To realize DSC, we propose a variable named  d-tag  (Dependency Tag) representing dependency of a signal value with respect to another signal value. For demonstrating our method, we prepared three design examples and implemented DSC circuits on them. As a result, we could successfully extract input signal values that influenced the target output value from a number of random input sequence, for every case. We observed that the number of the extracted input values was significantly smaller than that of the original sequence. The area overhead for DSC circuit were also practical, 4% in average."

However, the conventional approaches can have difficulties in practice. First, for a complex system such as an Android smartphone, building a cycle-accurate simulation environment is no easy task. Secondly, for I/O-intensive applications, a slow simulation would significantly alter the application behavior and change its performance profile. Thirdly, conventional software profiling tools generally do not work on simulators, which makes it difficult for performance analysis of complicated software, e.g., Java applications executed by the Dalvik virtual machine. Recently, virtual machine technologies are widely used to emulate a variety of computer systems. While virtual machines do not model the hardware components in the emulated system, we can ease the effort of building a simulation environment by leveraging the infrastructure of virtual machines and adding performance and power models. Moreover, multiple sets of the performance and energy models can be selectively used to verify if the speed of the simulated system impacts the software behavior. Finally, performance monitoring facilities can be integrated to work with profiling tools. We believe this approach should help overcome the aforementioned difficulties. We have prototyped a framework and our case studies showed that the information provided by our tools are useful for software optimization and system design for Android smartphones."
1682794,15237,8228,On the feasibility of using microfluidic technologies for communications in Labs-on-a-Chip,2012,"Microfluidics refers to manipulation and control of little amount of fluids flowing into channels of micro-scale size and is the basic technology utilized by Labs-on-a-Chip (LoC) systems. In the recent past researchers have analyzed the possibility to support information exchange between different elements of a LoC. However, support of communication in microfluidic systems relies on the use of appropriate information coding strategies and deep knowledge of channel propagation characteristics. Accordingly, in this paper we compare two different schemes for information coding and evaluate the corresponding capacities depending on the characteristics of the fluids utilized. Furthermore, we discuss how such encoding schemes can be integrated in networking solutions for LoCs."
1684852,15237,8335,Fixed-point accuracy analysis of datapaths with mixed CORDIC and polynomial computations,2012,"Fixed-point accuracy analysis of imprecise datapaths in terms of Maximum-Mismatch (MM) [1], or Mean-Square-Error (MSE) [14], w.r.t. a reference model is a challenging task. Typically, arithmetic circuits are represented with polynomials; however, for a variety of functions, including trigonometric, hyperbolic, logarithm, exponential, square root and division, Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) units can result in more efficient implementations with better accuracy. This paper presents a novel approach to robustly analyze the fixed-point accuracy of an imprecise datapath, which may consist of a combination of polynomials and CORDIC units. The approach builds a global polynomial for the error of the whole datapath by converting the CORDIC units and their errors into the lowest possible order Taylor series. The previous work for almost accurate analysis of MM [1] and MSE [14, 15] in large datapaths can only handle polynomial computations."
2269566,15237,8335,Data compression via logic synthesis,2014,"Nowadays, most software and hardware applications are committed to reduce the footprint and resource usage of data. In this general context, lossless data compression is a beneficial technique that encodes information using fewer (or at most equal number of) bits as compared to the original representation. A traditional compression flow consists of two phases: data decorrelation and entropy encoding. Data decorrelation, also called entropy reduction, aims at reducing the autocorrelation of the input data stream to be compressed in order to enhance the efficiency of entropy encoding. Entropy encoding reduces the size of the previously decorrelated data by using techniques such as Huffman coding, arithmetic coding, and others. When the data decorrelation is optimal, entropy encoding produces the strongest lossless compression possible. While efficient solutions for entropy encoding exist, data decorrelation is still a challenging problem limiting ultimate lossless compression opportunities. In this paper, we use logic synthesis to remove redundancy in binary data aiming to unlock the full potential of lossless compression. Embedded in a complete lossless compression flow, our logic synthesis based methodology is capable to identify the underlying function correlating a data set. Experimental results on data sets deriving from different causal processes show that the proposed approach achieves the highest compression ratio compared to state-of-art compression tools such as ZIP, bzip2 and 7zip."

1655250,15237,8335,Symbolic computation of SNR for variational analysis of sigma-delta modulator,2014,"Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is an important design metric for switched-capacitor sigma-delta modulators (SC-SDMs). In an automatic synthesis environment, fast SNR computation is of paramount importance. So far the main SNR computation method has been behavioral simulation. Other less accurate methods are based on empirical formulas. These methods could not contribute too much to the enhancement of synthesis efficiency. In this work a highly efficient and purely symbolic SNR computation method is proposed. The difficulty in the computation of noise power (requiring integration of a rational function) is overcome by Taylor polynomial approximation. Together with a symbolic loop-transfer analysis tool, the SNR can be computed fully symbolically. This novel computation method is applied to variational SC-SDM analysis. The effectiveness and efficiency are compared to behavioral Monte Carlo simulation results."
1861796,15237,8228,Beam broadening for phased antenna arrays using multi-beam subarrays,2012,"Consideration of mmWave frequencies with large phased antenna arrays has become increasingly important for providing multi-Gb/s wireless data communication. However, large phased antenna arrays tradeoff gain for very narrow beam widths, which may not always be desirable for outdoor, mobile communication. This paper provides a systematic approach for beam broadening for phased antenna arrays, with unit amplitude constraint and without turning off antennas, using multi-beam subarrays and without any increase in hardware complexity. We first show that the beam resulting from the full array lies in the region defined by the sum of the individual subarrays and beams can be shaped within the region using RF or baseband phase precoding. While both conjugating and flipping the weights for subarrays generate similar subarray responses, only flipping the weights guarantees a symmetric response of the full array about boresight. We develop expressions for the resultant array factor, the locations for the beam directions of the subarrays and the half power beam width of resulting beam. We show that the broadening factor is proportional to the square of number of subarrays and the final array can be designed to have less than a 3 dB ripple in the passband."

Our framework includes an off-chip system call emulation mechanism, which handles system calls to evaluate and verify the processor design with general benchmark programs without pseudo-circuits in the processor design. Therefore, our framework can be consistently used from RTL design to chip fabrication. We also propose a checkpoint mechanism that resumes a program from a pre-created checkpoint. This mechanism is not affected by the non-deterministic problem on a multi-core processor. Moreover, we propose a cache warming mechanism when resuming from a checkpoint."

Given a SystemC model, we partition it into processes suitable for GPU execution and CPU execution. We convert the processes identified for GPU execution into GPU kernels with additional SystemC wrapper processes that invoke these kernels. The wrappers enable seamless communication of events in all directions between the GPUs and CPUs. We alter the OSCI SystemC simulation kernel to allow parallel execution of processes. Hence, we co-simulate in parallel, the SystemC processes on multiple CPUs, and the GPU kernels on the GPUs; exploit both the CPUs, and GPUs for faster simulation. We experiment with synthetic benchmarks and a set-top box case study."
712493,15237,8306,An experimental study of data retention behavior in modern DRAM devices: implications for retention time profiling mechanisms,2013,"DRAM cells store data in the form of charge on a capacitor. This charge leaks off over time, eventually causing data to be lost. To prevent this data loss from occurring, DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed. Unfortunately, DRAM refresh operations waste energy and also degrade system performance by interfering with memory requests. These problems are expected to worsen as DRAM density increases.   The amount of time that a DRAM cell can safely retain data without being refreshed is called the cell's  retention time . In current systems, all DRAM cells are refreshed at the rate required to guarantee the integrity of the cell with the shortest retention time, resulting in unnecessary refreshes for cells with longer retention times. Prior work has proposed to reduce unnecessary refreshes by exploiting differences in retention time among DRAM cells; however, such mechanisms require knowledge of each cell's retention time.   In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative study of retention behavior in modern DRAMs. Using a temperature-controlled FPGA-based testing platform, we collect retention time information from 248 commodity DDR3 DRAM chips from five major DRAM vendors. We observe two significant phenomena:  data pattern dependence , where the retention time of each DRAM cell is significantly affected by the data stored in other DRAM cells, and  variable retention time , where the retention time of some DRAM cells changes unpredictably over time. We discuss possible physical explanations for these phenomena, how their magnitude may be affected by DRAM technology scaling, and their ramifications for DRAM retention time profiling mechanisms."

In this paper we propose, for the first time to our knowledge, a top-down control synthesis framework for the flow-based biochips. Starting from a given biochemical application and a biochip architecture, we synthesize the control logic that is used by the biochip controller to automatically execute the biochemical application. We also propose a control pin count minimization scheme aimed at efficiently utilizing chip area, reducing macro-assembly around the chip and enhancing chip scalability.

A mathematical model of the direct conversion and super heterodyne architectures together with a numerical breast phantom are developed. FDTD simulations data are used on the behavioral model to investigate the limits of both architectures from a circuit-level point of view.

2158346,15237,8306,Deconfigurable microprocessor architectures for silicon debug acceleration,2013,"The share of silicon debug in the overall microprocessor chips development cycle is rapidly expanding due to the ever growing design complexity and the limited efficiency of pre-silicon validation methods. Massive application of short random test programs on the prototype microprocessor chips is one of the most effective parts of silicon debug. However, a major bottleneck and source of noise in this phase is that large numbers of random test programs fail due to the same or similar design bugs. This redundant behavior adds long delays in the debug flow since each failing random program must be separately examined, although it does not usually bring new debug information. The development of effective techniques that detect dominant modes of failure among random programs and triage them into common categories eliminate redundant debug sessions and significantly boost silicon debug.   We propose the employment of deconfigurable microprocessor architectures along with self-checking random test programs to reduce the redundant debug sessions and make the triage step of silicon debug more efficient. Several hardware components of high performance microprocessor micro-architectures can be deconfigured while keeping the functional completeness of the design. This is the property we exploit in our silicon debug methodology for the triaging of random test programs. We support our methodology by a hardware mechanism dedicated to silicon debug that groups the failing test programs into categories depending on the microprocessor hardware components that need to be deconfigured for a random test program to be correctly executed. Identical deconfiguration sequences for multiple test programs indicate the existence of redundancy among them and group them together. This grouping significantly reduces the number of failing tests that must be debugged afterwards. Detailed evaluation of the method on an x86 microprocessor demonstrates its efficiency in reducing the debug sessions and thus in accelerating silicon debug."
1245867,15237,8335,Capturing the phantom of the power grid - on the runtime adaptive techniques for noise reduction,2012,"Power supply noise has become one of the primary concerns in low power designs. To ensure power integrity, designers need to make sure that voltage droop and bounce do not exceed noise margin in all possible scenarios. Since it is very difficult to capture the exact worst corner among the mist of complex functionalities in modern VLSI designs, statistical design methodologies have been adapted, which may bring significant design overhead. In view of this, various runtime techniques have been proposed in literature to suppress power grid noise adaptively. This paper first presents various challenges in power grid designs from an industrial perspective, explains the difficulties in handling them at deign time, and then reviews various runtime techniques to adaptively suppress power supply noise, including sensor-based power gating, re-routable decaps, proactive clock frequency actuator, and PLL based clocking."
1466519,15237,369,Wake-Up Channel Selection for On-Demand WiFi Wake-Up Using WLAN Signals,2014,"In order to reduce energy wastefully consumed by WiFi device, Radio-On-Demand Networks (ROD) has been proposed, which offers wireless access in an on-demand manner. Each WiFi device in ROD is equipped with a low-power wake-up receiver which is capable of detecting the length of frames observed over WiFi channels through envelope detection and on-off-keying (OOK) processing. Once the wake-up receiver detects the predefined set of length of WiFi frames included in the wake-up signal transmitted by the other WiFi device, it turns its main WiFi module on. The wake-up receiver extracts WiFi signals over all WiFi channels at 2.4 GHz band. On the other hand, a WiFi device, which tries to wake up the other device, selects a wake-up channel, a channel to transmit its wake-up signal. In this case, the receiver observes an envelope which is the combination of the wake-up signal and the interfering signals existing over all WiFi channels. Here, how to select the wake-up channel is a key issue when the degree of interference is different among multiple WiFi channels. In this paper, with different degree of interference in each channel, we evaluate the impact of wake-up channel selection on the wake-up success probability of WiFi device. Besides simulations results, we also present experimental results which are obtained with our developed prototype of wake-up receiver."
885470,15237,8335,A clique-based approach to find binding and scheduling result in flow-based microfluidic biochips,2013,"Microfluidic biochips have been recently proposed to integrate all the necessary functions for biochemical analysis. There are several types of microfluidic biochips; among them there has been a great interest in flow-based microfluidic biochips, in which the flow of liquid is manipulated using integrated microvalves. By combining several microvalves, more complex resource units such as micropumps, switches and mixers can be built. For efficient execution, the flow of liquid routes in microfluidic biochips needs to be scheduled under some resource constraints or routing constraints. The execution time of the biochemical operations depends on the binding and scheduling results. The most previously developed binding and scheduling algorithms are based on heuristics, and there has been no method to obtain optimal results. Considering the above, this paper proposes an optimal method by casting the problem to a clique problem."
1670826,15237,8335,Training itself: Mixed-signal training acceleration for memristor-based neural network,2014,"The artificial neural network (ANN) is among the most widely used methods in data processing applications. The memristor-based neural network further demonstrates a power efficient hardware realization of ANN. Training phase is the critical operation of memristor-based neural network. However, the traditional training method for memristor-based neural network is time consuming and energy inefficient. Users have to first work out the parameters of memristors through digital computing systems and then tune the memristor to the corresponding state. In this work, we introduce a mixed-signal training acceleration framework, which realizes the self-training of memristor-based neural network. We first modify the original stochastic gradient descent algorithm by approximating calculations and designing an alternative computing method. We then propose a mixed-signal acceleration architecture for the modified training algorithm by equipping the original memristor-based neural network architecture with the copy crossbar technique, weight update units, sign calculation units and other assistant units. The experiment on the MNIST database demonstrates that the proposed mixed-signal acceleration is 3 orders of magnitude faster and 4 orders of magnitude more energy efficient than the CPU implementation counterpart at the cost of a slight decrease of the recognition accuracy (<; 5%)."
2167028,15237,8335,An enhanced leakage-aware scheduler for dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs,2011,"The FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Array) are popular in hardware designs and even hardware/software co-designs. Due to the advance of manufacturing technologies, leakage power has become an important issue in the design of modern FPGAs. In particular, the partially dynamical reconfigurable FP-GAs allow the latency between FPGA reconfiguration and task execution for the performance consideration. However, this latency introduces unnecessary leakage power called leakage waste. In this work, we propose a leakage-aware scheduling algorithm to minimize the leakage waste without increasing the schedule length of tasks. In this algorithm, a priority dispatcher with a split-aware placement is proposed to reduce the scheduling complexity with considering the hardware constraints of FPGAs. A series of experiments based on synthetic designs demonstrates that the proposed algorithm could effectively reduce leakage waste with limited sacrifices on the task schedulability."
1785274,15237,8335,Low-cost control flow error protection by exploiting available redundancies in the pipeline,2012,"Due to device miniaturization and reducing supply voltage, embedded systems are becoming more susceptible to transient faults. Specifically, faults in control flow can change the execution sequence, which might be catastrophic for safety critical applications. Many techniques are devised using software, hardware or software-hardware co-design for control flow error checking. Software techniques suffer from a significant amount of code size overhead, and hence, negative impact on performance and energy consumption. On the other hand, hardware-based techniques have a significant amount of hardware and area cost. In this research we exploit the available redundancies in the pipeline. The branch target buffer stores target addresses of taken branches, and ALU generates target addresses using the low-order branch displacement bits of branch instructions. To exploit these redundancies in the pipeline, we propose a control flow error checking (CFEC) scheme. It can detect control flow errors and recover from them with negligible energy and performance overhead."

1758180,15237,8335,A network-flow based valve-switching aware binding algorithm for flow-based microfluidic biochips,2013,"Designs of flow-based microfluidic biochips are receiving much attention recently because they replace conventional biological automation paradigm and are able to integrate different biochemical analysis functions on a chip. However, as the design complexity increases, a flow-based microfluidic biochip needs more chip-integrated micro-valves, i.e., the basic unit of fluid-handling functionality, to manipulate the fluid flow for biochemical applications. Moreover, frequent switching of micro-valves results in decreased reliability. To minimize the valve-switching activities, we develop a network-flow based resource binding algorithm based on breadth-first search (BFS) and minimum cost maximum flow (MCMF) in architectural-level synthesis. The experimental results show that our methodology not only makes significant reduction of valve-switching activities but also diminishes the application completion time for both real-life applications and a set of synthetic benchmarks."

It is shown that, with only one system solve, the nominal parasitic capacitances as well as its relative standard deviations caused by both systematic and random geometric variations can be obtained. The additional calculation for both variations can be done at a very modest computational time, which is negligible compared to that of the standard capacitance extraction without considering any variation. Specifically, using the proposed method, experiments and a case study have been analyzed to show the impact of the random variation on the capacitance for a real design."

Using the traffic information of applications, we develop a routing scheme which can achieve a higher adaptivity than the generic ones and at the same time distribute the traffic more uniformly. A set of deadlock-free admissible paths for all the communications is first obtained. To reduce the hot-spot temperature, we find the optimal distribution ratio of the communication traffic among the set of candidate paths. The problem of finding this optimal distribution ratio is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem and is solved offline. A router microarchitecture which supports our ratio-based selection policy is also proposed. From the simulation results, the peak energy reduction considering the energy consumption of both the processors and routers can be as high as 16.6% for synthetic traffic and real benchmarks."

Verification of the implementation of power management logic involves the task of checking whether only the intended power states are reached. Typically, the number of global power states reachable by the global power management strategy is significantly lesser than the possible number of global power states. In this paper, we present a formal method for determining the set of reachable global power states in a power-managed design. Our approach demonstrates how this task can be further constrained as required by the verification engineer. We highlight the efficacy of the proposed methods over several test-cases."

Our approach consists of a task scheduling algorithm and an SPM allocation algorithm. The former constructs a feasible schedule incrementally, aiming to minimize the number of preemptions in the feasible schedule. The latter allocates a portion of the SPM to each task in an efficient way by employing a novel data structure, namely, the preemption graph. We have evaluated our approach and a previous approach by using six task sets. The results show that our approach achieves up to 20.31% on WCRT (Worst-Case Response Time) reduction over the previous approach."

The consumption of sample/buffer/waste is usually used to evaluate the effectiveness of a sample preparation process. In this paper, for the first time, we present an optimal sample preparation algorithm based on a minimum-cost maximum-flow model. By using the proposed model, we can obtain both the optimal cost of sample and buffer usage and the waste amount even for multiple-target concentrations. Experiments demonstrate that we can consistently achieve much better results not only in the consumption of sample and buffer but also the waste amount when compared with all the state-of-the-art of the previous approaches."
1365478,15237,8335,DARNS:A randomized multi-modulo RNS architecture for double-and-add in ECC to prevent power analysis side channel attacks,2013,"Security in embedded systems is of critical importance since most of our secure transactions are currently made via credit cards or mobile phones. Power analysis based side channel attacks have been proved as the most successful attacks on embedded systems to retrieve secret keys, allowing impersonation and theft. State-of-the-art solutions for such attacks in Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), mostly in software, hinder performance and repeatedly attacked using improved techniques. To protect the ECC from both simple power analysis and differential power analysis, as a hardware solution, we propose to take advantage of the inherent parallelization capability in Multi-modulo Residue Number Systems (RNS) architectures to obfuscate the secure information. Random selection of moduli is proposed to randomly choose the moduli sets for each key bit operation. This solution allows us to prevent power analysis, while still providing all the benefits of RNS. In this paper, we show that Differential Power Analysis is thwarted, as well as correlation analysis."

As a more economic solution, we try to improve communication efficiency without increasing the buffer size. A Buffer-Stealing (BS) mechanism is proposed, which enables the input channels that have insufficient buffer space to utilize at runtime the unused input buffers from other input channels. Implementation results of the proposed BS design for a 64-bit 5-input-buffer router show a reduction of the average packet transmission latency by up to 10.17% and an increase of the average throughput by up to 23.47%, at an overhead of 22% more hardware resources."

However their comparatively higher write latencies and energies continue to be roadblocks for migrating to MRAM based technology in memory hierarchies. In this paper, we present a novel method by which we demonstrate significant energy reduction in writing to the STT-RAM cell by relaxing its non-volatility property. We exploit this characteristic for optimizing system-level properties such as garbage collection. By categorizing the objects based on their lifetimes it is possible to tune the data retention time of the STT-RAM to minimize the write energy. Our scheme yielded 37% reduction in dynamic energy, 88% reduction in leakage and 85% improvement in the Energy-Delay Product over a corresponding SRAM based memory structure."
1342852,15237,8335,An ILP-based obstacle-avoiding routing algorithm for pin-constrained EWOD chips,2012,"Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chips have become the most popular actuator particularly for droplet-based digital microfluidic (DMF) systems. In order to enable the electrical manipulations, wire routing is a key problem in designing EWOD chips. Unlike traditional very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) routing problems, in addition to routing-path establishment on signal pins, the EWOD-chip routing problem needs to address the issue of signal sharing for pin-count reduction under a practical constraint posed by limited pin-count supply. Moreover, EWOD-chip designs might incur several obstacles in the routing region due to embedded devices for specific fluidic protocols. However, no existing works consider the EWOD-chip routing with obstacles. To remedy this insufficiency, we propose in this paper the first obstacle-avoiding routing algorithm for pin-constrained EWOD chips. Our algorithm, based on effective integer-linear-programming (ILP) formulation as well as efficient routing framework, can achieve high routability with a low design complexity. Experimental results based on real-life chips with obstacles demonstrate the high routability of our obstacle-avoiding routing algorithm for pin-constrained EWOD chips."
767372,15237,8335,Tackling close-to-band passivity violations in passive macro-modeling,2014,"Passivity enforcement is important for macro-modeling for passive systems from measured or simulated S-parameter data. State-space systems generated from vector fitting usually present strong passivity violation outside the frequency bandwidth especially in the close-to-band (CTB) region. Removing such close-to-band violation is very difficult with existing passivity enforcement techniques without severely sacrificing the accuracy of the model. In this paper we propose a frequency data extension method which aims to reduce or even eliminate such close-to-band violations without sacrificing model accuracy. The generated model can be used in a later stage for further passivity enforcement. Experiments show that with applying the proposed method, the accuracy of the generated model can be significantly improved."

933745,15237,23907,Understanding the Antikythera Mechanism,2011,"In 1900, a party of sponge divers chanced on the wreck of a Roman merchant vessel between Crete and mainland Greece. It was found to contain numerous ancient Greek treasures, among them a mysterious lump of clay that split open to reveal ‘mathematical gears’ as it dried out. Constructed in roughly 150 B.C.E., this object is now known as the Antikythera Mechanism, one of the most enlightening artifacts in terms of revealing the advanced nature of ancient Greek science and technology. In 2005 we travelled to the National Archeological Museum in Athens to apply our Reflectance Imaging methods to the mechanism in the hopes of revealing ancient writing on the device. We were successful, and along with the results of Microfocus CT imaging, we are able to decipher 3000 characters compared with the original 800 known. This lead to an understanding that the device was a mechanical, astronomical computer capable of predicting solar and lunar eclipses along with other celestial events. This talk will overview both the imaging methods as well as what they reveal about the Antikythera Mechanism."
321604,15237,293,Dynamics of prefix usage at an edge router,2011,"We investigate prefix activity on peering links between a regional Internet aggregation point and two tier-1 ISPs by analyzing a 24 hour packet trace from our regional ISP. Our data shows that a small number of prefixes carry the bulk of the packets, which corroborates previous work. However, unlike previous work, which focused on traffic from backbone routers, we look at edge traffic. In addition, we look at prefix activity at fine timescales, in the order of minutes, instead of just the aggregate view, which allows us to better understand the dynamics of prefix behavior. We define two metrics to capture the dynamic behavior of prefixes: the duty cycle captures a prefix's activity, while the mean rank difference captures how busy a prefix is. This allows us to estimate not only how much traffic a prefix carries, but also how that traffic is distributed throughout the day.We expect that our work will inform new route caching strategies (to alleviate the strain from an ever expanding global routing table) and evaluation of the performance of new routing architectures such as virtual aggregation and map-n-encap."
1943438,15237,8335,Wire synthesizable global routing for timing closure,2011,"Despite remarkable progress in the area of global routing, the burdens imposed by modern physical synthesis flows are far greater than those expected or anticipated by available (academic) routing engines. As interconnects dominate the path delay, physical synthesis such as buffer insertion and gate sizing has to integrate with layer assignment. Layer directives -- commonly generated during wire synthesis to meet tight frequency targets -- play a critical role in reducing interconnect delay of smaller technology nodes. Unfortunately, they are not presently understood or honored by leading global routers, nor do existing techniques trivially extend toward their resolution. The shortcomings contribute to a dangerous blindspot in optimization and timing closure, leading to unroutable and/or underperforming designs. In this paper, we aim to resolve the  layer compliance problem  in routing congestion evaluation and global routing, which is very critical for timing closure with physical synthesis. We propose a method of progressive projection to account for wire tags and layer directives, in which classes of nets are successively applied and locked while performing partial aggregation. The method effectively models the resource contention of layer constraints by faithfully accumulating capacity of bounded layer ranges, enabling three-dimensional assignment to subsequently achieve complete directive compliance. The approach is general, and can piggyback on existing interfaces used to communicate with popular academic engines. Empirical results on the ICCAD 2009 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach successfully routes many designs that are otherwise unroutable with existing techniques and naive approaches."
1162030,15237,8335,A model-based design of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems,2014,"Cyber-Physical Energy Systems (CPES) are an amalgamation of both power gird technology, and the intelligent communication and co-ordination between the supply and the demand side through distributed embedded computing. Through this combination, CPES are intended to deliver power efficiently, reliably, and economically. The design and development work needed to either implement a new power grid network or upgrade a traditional power grid to a CPES-compliant one is both challenging and time consuming due to the heterogeneous nature of the associated components/subsystems. The Model Based Design (MBD) methodology has been widely seen as a promising solution to address the associated design challenges of creating a CPES. In this paper, we demonstrate a MBD method and its associated tool for the purpose of designing and validating various control algorithms for a residential microgrid. Our presented co-simulation engine GridMat is a MATLAB/Simulink toolbox; the purpose of it is to co-simulate the power systems modeled in GridLAB-D as well as the control algorithms that are modeled in Simulink.

This paper presents fuzzy flow regulation. Being different from the static flow regulation policy, our system makes regulation decisions fully dynamically according to traffic dynamism and the state of interconnection network. The central idea is to use fuzzy logic to mimic the behavior of an expert that can recognize the network status and then intelligently control the admission of input flows. As the experiment results show, the maximum improvement in average delay reaches 53.0% against static regulation and 37.4% against no regulation. The maximum improvement in average throughput reaches 37.5% against static regulation and 23.8% against no regulation."
2184989,15237,8335,A hybrid random walk algorithm for 3-D thermal analysis of integrated circuits,2014,"In this work, a hybrid random walk method is proposed for the thermal analysis of integrated circuits. Preserving the advantage of generic random walk method (GRW), i.e. the suitability for simulating local hot-spots, the proposed techniques largely reduce its runtime for accurate high-resolution simulation, and is suitable for the realistic pyramid-shape IC model. This is achieved by combining the GRW and the floating random walk techniques, and a novel usage of rectangular cuboid transition domain. The techniques to handle the Neumann boundary and convective boundary in thermal simulation are also discussed. Numerical experiments on several IC test cases validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed techniques, and demonstrate more than 100X speedup over the GRW method."

Given this information, we demonstrate a post-silicon tuning method on row voltage supplies (inside a chip) to restore the performance of failed chips. The method uses the performance map to set voltages by either pumping up the voltage on cells with worse delays or tuning down on fast cells to save power.

796369,15237,8335,Applying VLSI EDA to energy distribution system design,2014,"Energy distribution networks refer to that part of the electricity network that delivers power to homes and business. It is reported that significant amounts of energy are being wasted simply due to inefficiencies in this network. Further, this domain is rapidly changing with new types of loads such as electric vehicles or the spread of new types of energy sources such as photo-voltaic and wind. In this paper, we demonstrate a comprehensive design automation capability for energy distribution networks leading to much more flexible yet effective system. The new system's capabilities include power load distribution and transfers, equipment upgrading, geospatial-aware network optimization, outage identification, contingency planning and loss analysis/reduction. These features are enabled by advanced simulation, analysis and optimization engines that are adapted from those available in the traditional VLSI design automation area. The paper will conclude with potential future research directions that require further innovations in energy distribution networks."
1481217,15237,8335,An ILP-based automatic bus planner for dense PCBs,2013,"Modern PCBs have to be routed manually since no EDA tools can successfully route these complex boards. An auto-router for PCBs would improve design productivity tremendously since each board takes about 2 months to route manually. This paper focuses on a major step in PCB routing called bus planning. In the bus planning problem, we need to simultaneously solve the bus decomposition, escape routing, layer assignment and global bus routing. This problem was partially addressed by Kong et al. in [3] where they only focused on the layer assignment and global bus routing, assuming bus decomposition and escape routing are given. In this paper, we present an ILP-based solution to the entire bus planning problem. We apply our bus planner to an industrial PCB (with over 7000 nets and 12 signal layers) which was previously successfully routed manually, and compare with a state-of-the-art industrial internal tool where the layer assignment and global bus routing are based on the algorithm in [3]. Our bus planner successfully routed 97.4% of all the nets. This is a huge improvement over the industrial tool which could only achieve 84.7% routing completion for this board."
1094422,15237,8335,Automata-theoretic modeling of fixed-priority non-preemptive scheduling for formal timing verification,2014,"The design process of safety-critical systems requires formal analysis methods to ensure their correct functionality without over-sized safety margins and extensive testing. For architectures with state-based events or scheduling, such as load-dependent frequency scaling, model checking has emerged as a promising tool. It formally verifies timing behavior of realtime systems with minimal over-approximation of the worst case delays. In this context, Event Count Automata (ECAs) have become a valuable modeling approach because they are specifically designed to handle typical arrival patterns and integrate well with analytic techniques. In this work, we propose an extension of the ECA framework's semantics and use it in a Fixed-Priority Non-preemptive Scheduling (FPNS) model that correctly abstracts the intra-slot behavior in the slotted-time model of the ECA. This is challenging because straightforward implementations cannot capture the full behavior of event-triggered scheduling with such a time model that the ECA shares with most model checking based methods. In a case study, we obtain bounds via model checking a basic model and then our proposed model. We compare these bounds with a SystemC simulation. This shows that the bounds from the basic model are too optimistic - and exceeded in practice - because it does not capture the full behavior, while the bounds from the proposed extended model are both safe and reasonably tight."
1130461,15237,8335,SDG2KPN: System Dependency Graph to function-level KPN generation of legacy code for MPSoCs,2014,"The Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) paradigm as a viable implementation platform for parallel processing has expanded to encompass embedded devices. The ability to execute code in parallel gives MPSoCs the potential to achieve high performance with low power consumption. In order for sequential legacy code to take advantage of the MPSoC design paradigm, it must first be partitioned into data flow graphs (such as Kahn Process Networks - KPNs) to ensure the data elements can be correctly passed between the separate processing elements that operate on them. Existing techniques are inadequate for use in complex legacy code. This paper proposes SDG2KPN, a System Dependency Graph to KPN conversion methodology targeting the conversion of legacy code. By creating KPNs at the granularity of the function-/procedure-level, SDG2KPN is the first of its kind to support shared and global variables as well as many more program patterns/application types. We also provide a design flow which allows the creation of MPSoC systems utilizing the produced KPNs. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by retargeting several sequential applications to the Tensilica MPSoC framework. Our system parallelized AES, an application of 950 lines, in 4.8 seconds, while H.264, of 57896 lines, took 164.9 seconds to parallelize."

1458570,15237,8335,A separation and minimum wire length constrained maze routing algorithm under nanometer wiring rules,2013,"Due to process limitations, wiring rules are imposed by foundries on chip layout. Under nanometer wiring rules, the required separation between two wire ends is dependent on their surrounding wires, and there is a limit on the minimum length of each wire segment. Yet, traditional maze routing algorithms are not designed to handle these rules, so rule violations are corrected by post-processing and the quality of result is seriously impacted. For this reason, we propose a new maze routing algorithm capable of handling these wiring rules. The proposed algorithm is proved to find a legal shortest path with time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of grid points. Experiments with seven tight industrial cases show that the runtime of a commercial router is reduced by 2.4 times and the total wire length is also reduced by 3% on average."
1633756,15237,8335,Hungarian algorithm based virtualization to maintain application timing similarity for defect-tolerant NoC,2012,"Homogeneous manycore processors are emerging in broad application areas, including those with timing requirements, such as real-time and embedded applications. Typically, these processors employ Network-on-Chip (NoC) as the communication infrastructure and core-level redundancy is often used as an effective approach to improve the yield of manycore chips. For a given application's task graph and a task to core mapping strategy, the traffic pattern on the NoC is known a priori. However, when defective cores are replaced by redundant ones, the NoC topology changes. As a result, a fine-tuned program based on timing parameters given by one topology may not meet the expected timing behavior under the new one. To address this issue, a timing similarity metric is introduced to evaluate timing resemblances between different NoC topologies. Based on this metric, a Hungarian method based algorithm is developed to reconfigure a defect-tolerant manycore platform and form a unified application specific virtual core topology of which the timing variations caused by such reconfiguration are minimized. Our case studies indicate that the proposed metric is able to accurately measure the timing differences between different NoC topologies. The standard deviation between the calculated difference using the metric and the difference obtained through simulation is less than 6.58%. Our case studies also indicate that the developed Hungarian method based algorithm using the metric performs close to the optimal solution in comparison to random defect-redundant core assignments."
1379771,15237,8335,Topology-aware buffer insertion and GPU-based massively parallel rerouting for ECO timing optimization,2012,"Conventional buffer insertion in timing ECO involves only minimizing the arrival time of the most critical sink in one multi-pin net and neglects the obstacles and the topology of routed wire segments, which may worsen the arrival times of other sinks and burden subsequent timing ECO. This work develops a topology-aware ECO timing optimization (TOPO) flow that comprises three phases - buffering pair scoring, edge breaking and buffer connection, and topology restructuring. TOPO effectively improves the arrival times of violation sinks without worsening those of other sinks. Experimental results indicate that TOPO improves the worst negative slack (WNS) and total negative slack (TNS) of benchmarks by an average of 79.2% and 84.3%, respectively. The proposed algorithm improves the arrival time that is achieved using conventional two-pin net-based buffer insertion by an average of 40.4%, at the cost of consuming 19× runtime. To speed up routing and further improve sink slack, a highly scalable massively parallel maze routing on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform is also developed to enable the proposed flow to explore more solution candidates. High scalability and parallelism are realized by block partitioning and staggering. Experiments reveal that the proposed GPU-based parallel maze routing can achieve near 12× runtime speedup for two-pin routings. With parallelized maze routing, WNS violations in four out of five cases can be resolved."

While control signals are exchanged over the communication bus, they have to wait for bus access and therefore experience a delay. We propose certain (co-)design guidelines for (i) the communication schedule, and (ii) the controller, such that stability of the control applications is guaranteed for more flexible communication delay constraints than what has been studied before. We illustrate the applicability of our design approach using the FlexRay dynamic segment as the communication medium for the processing units."
1795078,15237,8335,An intelligent analysis of Iddq data for chip classification in very deep-submicron (VDSM) CMOS technology,2012,"Iddq testing has been a critical integral component in test suites for screening unreliable devices. As the silicon technology keeps shrinking, Iddq values and their variation increase as well. Moreover, along with rapid design scaling, defect-induced leakage currents become less significant when compared to full-chip current and also make themselves less distinguishable. Traditional Iddq methods become less effective and cause more test escapes and yield loss. Therefore, in this paper, a new test method named σ-Iddq testing is proposed and integrates (1) a variation-aware full-chip leakage estimator and (2) a clustering algorithm to classify chip without using threshold values. Experimental result shows that σ-Iddq testing achieves a higher classification accuracy in a 45nm technology when compared to a single-threshold Iddq testing. As a result, both the process-variation and design-scaling impacts are successfully excluded and thus the defective chips can be identified intelligently."
2495671,15237,8335,Mask cost reduction with circuit performance consideration for self-aligned double patterning,2011,"Double patterning lithography (DPL) is the enabling technology for printing in sub-32nm nodes. In the EDA literature, researchers have been focusing on double-exposure double-patterning (DEDP) DPL for printing arbitrary 2D features where the layout decomposition problem for double exposure is an interesting graph coloring problem. But due to overlay errors, it is very difficult for DEDP to print even 1D features. A more promising DPL technology is self-aligned double patterning (SADP) for 1D design. SADP first prints dense lines and then trims away the portions not on the design by a cut mask. The complexity of cut mask is very high, adding to the sky-rocketing manufacturing cost. In this paper we present a mask cost reduction method with circuit performance consideration for SADP. This is the first paper to focus on the mask cost reduction issue for SADP from a design perspective. We simplify the polygons on the cut mask, by formulating the problem as a constrained shortest path problem. Experimental results show that with a set of layouts in 28nm technology, we can largely reduce the complexity of cut polygons, with little impact on performance."
1672771,15237,8335,Fast large-scale optimal power flow analysis for smart grid through network reduction,2014,"Optimal power flow (OPF) plays an important role in power system operation. The emerging smart grid aims to create an automated energy delivery system that enables two-way flows of electricity and information. As a result, it will be desirable if OPF can be solved in real time in order to allow the implementation of the time-sensitive applications, such as real-time pricing. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to accelerate the computation of alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) through power system network reduction (NR). We formulate the OPF problem based on an equivalent reduced system and interpret its solution and the detailed optimal dispatch for the original power system is obtained afterwards using a distributed algorithm. Our results are compared with two widely used methods: full ACOPF and the linearized OPF with DC power flow and lossless network assumption, the so-called DCOPF. Experimental results show that for a large power system, our method achieves 7.01X speedup over ACOPF with only 1.72% error, and is 75.7% more accurate than the DCOPF solution. Our method is even 10% faster than DCOPF. Our experimental results demonstrate the unique strength of the proposed technique for fast, scalable, and accurate OPF computation. We also show that our method is effective for smaller benchmarks."

In this paper, we propose a novel technique that adaptively determines per-chip current-threshold for IDDQ testing to enhance test accuracy. In the proposed technique, process condition of a chip and fault-sensitization vector are first estimated based on measured IDDQ currents through Bayesian inference. Then, using the estimated process condition, a statistical distribution of the leakage current for each test pattern is calculated and suitable current-threshold is determined by the distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can successfully detect a very small leakage fault, down to 16% of the nominal IDDQ current with the test escape ratio of 3.1 %."

A new formulation of the DMFB droplet routing problem is introduced for the continuous domain, which attempts to minimize total energy consumption while meeting a timing constraint. Henceforth, DMFBs should be viewed as continuous, highly integrated cyber-physical systems that interact with and manipulate physical quantities, as opposed to inherently discrete and fully synchronized devices."

1641989,15237,8228,Introducing purely hydrodynamic networking mechanisms in microfluidic systems,2013,"Microfluidic is a multidisciplinary field with practical applications to the design of systems, called Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC), where tiny volumes of fluids are circulated through channels with millimeter size and driven into structures where precise chemical/physical processes take place. One subcategory of microfluidic is droplet-based microfluidic, which disperse discrete volumes of fluids into a continuous stream of another immiscible fluid, which act as droplet carrier. Droplets can then be moved, merged, split, or processed in many other ways by suitably managing the hydrodynamic parameters of the LoC. A very interesting research challenge consists in developing basic microfluidic structures able to interconnect specialized LoCs by means of a flexible and modular microfluidic network. The aim of this paper is to exploit the properties of droplet-based microfluidics to realize purely hydrodynamic microfluidic elements that provide basic networking functionalities, such as addressing and switching. We define some simple mathematical models that capture the macroscopic behavior of droplets in microfluidic networks and use such models to design and analyze a simple microfluidic network system with bus topology."
2035415,15237,8335,Deterministic test for the reproduction and detection of board-level functional failures,2011,"A common scenario in industry today is No Trouble Found (NTF) due to functional failures. A component on a board fails during board-level functional test, but it passes the Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) test when it is returned to the supplier for warranty replacement or service repair. To find the root cause of NTF, we propose an innovative functional test approach and DFT methods for the detection of boardlevel functional failures. These DFT and test methods allow us to reproduce and detect functional failures in a controlled deterministic environment, which can provide ATE tests to the supplier for early screening of defective parts. Experiments on an industry design show that functional scan test with appropriate functional constraints can adequately mimic the functional state space well (measured by appropriate coverage metrics). Experiments also show that most functional failures due to stuck-at, dominant bridging, and crosstalk faults can be reproduced and detected by functional scan test."
1955357,15237,8335,On applying erroneous clock gating conditions to further cut down power,2011,"All of today's known clock gating techniques only disable clocks on valid (correct) clock gating conditions, like idle states or observability don't cares (ODC), whose applying will not change the circuit functionality. In this paper, we explore a technique that allows shutting down certain clocks during invalid cycles, which if applied alone will certainly cause erroneous results. However, the erroneous results will be corrected either during the current or later stages by injecting other clock gating conditions to cancel out each other's error effects before they reach the primary outputs. Under this model, conditions across multiple flip-flop stages can also be analyzed to locate easily correctable erroneous clock gating conditions. Experimental results show that by using this error cancellation technique, a total power (including dynamic and leakage power) cut of up to 23% and in average of around 6% could be stably achieved, no matter with or without applying Power Compiler (which brought a power cut of 4% in average) together. The results indicate that the power saving conditions found by this new technique were nearly orthogonal (independent) to what can be done by the popular commercial power optimization tool. The idea of these new multi-stage logic error cancellation operations can potentially be applied to other sequential logic synthesis problems as well."

Margin is indeed necessary between some cell pairs, but there are also lots of cell pairs that do not yield any defects (or have very low probability of defects) when they are placed without margin. We address a new placement problem using standard cells without inter-cell margin. Placement should be done such that defect probability is made as small as possible while standard objectives such as wirelength is also pursued. The key in this approach is efficient computation of defect probabilities of all cell pairs and arranging them as a table that is referred to by a placer. We study how the cell pairs can be grouped by examining similar patterns along cell boundary, which greatly reduces the number of defect probability computation. The proposed placement method was evaluated on a few test circuits using 28-nm technology. Chip area was reduced by 10.8% on average with average and maximum defect probability kept below 0.4% and 4.1%, respectively."
759777,15237,8335,Linear time algorithm to find all relocation positions for EUV defect mitigation,2013,"Due to the absence of defect-free blanks in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, defect mitigation is necessary before mass production. One effective defect mitigation approach is to cover defects by device features, such that the defects will no longer be printable. Normally die size is much smaller than the exposure field on the blank, such that one blank can accommodate multiple copies of a die, each of which can be placed independently within the exposure field. For thorough utilization of blank area, the number of valid dies that are not impacted by any defects should be maximized. To do so, all relocation positions to place a single valid die on a defective blank must be determined first [1]. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work can find all relocation positions throughout the whole blank in a reasonable amount of time. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem. The time complexity of our algorithm is linear in the number of features in the die. Experimental results with full die layouts generated from a standard cell library validate the efficiency of our algorithm. Comparing to the algorithm in [2] which runs more than one week without termination, our algorithm only takes several hours to find all relocation positions for a die with millions of features."

2111876,15237,8335,On the impact of gate oxide degradation on SRAM dynamic and static write-ability,2011,"Low voltage operation of SRAM arrays is critical in reducing the power consumption of embedded microprocessors. The minimum voltage of operation,  V min  , can be limited by any combination of write failure, read disturb failure, access failure and/or retention failure. Of these, the write failure is often observed as the major  V min   limiter in sub-50nm processes. In addition, the current generation transistors have high- k  metal gate (HKMG) and these are prone to degradation due to higher level of electric field stress. The degradation increases  V min   due to increase in dynamic write failures and eventually, static write failures as the supply voltage decreases. We show that there exists a critical breakdown resistance ( R crit  ) for a given supply voltage at which the SRAM write failure transitions from being dynamically limited to statically limited. For a 32nm low-power SRAM, the value of  R crit   increases by ~9X as the supply voltage reduces from 1V to 0.7V. Further, we show that the commonly used SRAM write-assist (WA) techniques do not lower  R crit   and can only improve the write-ability when the breakdown resistance,  R sbd  , is larger than  R crit  ."

Severe challenges have been emerging for the realization of dependable VLSI circuits and systems with necessary and sufficient amount of reliability and security. For coping with the increasing threats on manufacturability, variability, and transient (soft) errors, we have been working on the development of “Dependable VLSI Platform using Robust Fabrics.” The project tackles the challenges with collaborative researches on layout, circuit, architecture, and design automation.

1350080,15237,8335,Array scalarization in high level synthesis,2014,"Parallelism across loop iterations present in behavioral specifications can typically be exposed and optimized using well known techniques such as Loop Unrolling. However, since behavioral arrays are usually mapped to memories (SRAM) during synthesis, performance bottlenecks arise due to memory port constraints. We study array scalarization, the transformation of an array into a group of scalar variables. We propose a technique for selectively scalarizing arrays for improving the performance of synthesized designs by taking into consideration the latency benefits as well as the area overhead caused by using discrete registers for storing array elements instead of denser SRAM. Our experiments on several benchmark examples indicate promising speedups of more than 10x for several designs due to scalarization."

This procedure is based on presilicon analysis, postsilicon ROSC measurements, a new aging analysis model called the Upperbound on f Max  (UofM), and a look-up table that stores a precomputed degradation ratio that translates delay shifts in the ROSC to those in the circuits. This method not only yields delay estimates within 0.2% of the true values with very low runtime, but is also independent of temperature and supply voltage variations."
1145010,15237,8335,Efficient matrix exponential method based on extended Krylov subspace for transient simulation of large-scale linear circuits,2014,"Matrix exponential (MEXP) method has been demonstrated to be a competitive candidate for transient simulation of very large-scale integrated circuits. Nevertheless, the performance of MEXP based on ordinary Krylov subspace is unsatisfactory for stiff circuits, wherein the underlying Arnoldi process tends to oversample the high magnitude part of the system spectrum while undersampling the low magnitude part that is important to the final accuracy. In this work we explore the use of extended Krylov subspace to generate more accurate and efficient approximation for MEXP. We also develop a formulation that allows unequal positive and negative dimensions in the generated Krylov subspace for better performance. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method."
1234612,15237,8335,On potential design impacts of electromigration awareness,2013,"Reliability issues significantly limit performance improvements from Moore's-Law scaling. At 45nm and below, electromigration (EM) is a serious reliability issue which affects global and local interconnects in a chip and limits performance scaling. Traditional IC implementation flows meet a 10-year lifetime requirement by overdesigning and sacrificing performance. At the same time, it is well-known among circuit designers that Black's Equation [2] suggests that lifetime can be traded for performance. In our work, we carefully study the impacts of EM-awareness on IC implementation outcomes, and show that circuit performance does not trade off so smoothly with mean time to failure (MTTF) as suggested by Black's Equation. We conduct two basic studies: EM lifetime versus performance with fixed resource budget, and EM lifetime versus resource with fixed performance. Using design examples implemented in two process nodes, we show that performance scaling achieved by reducing the EM lifetime requirement depends on the EM slack in the circuit, which in turn depends on factors such as timing constraints, length of critical paths and the mix of cell sizes. Depending on these factors, the performance gain can range from 10% to 80% when the lifetime requirement is reduced from 10 years to one year. We show that at a fixed performance requirement, power and area resources are affected by the timing slack and can either decrease by 3% or increase by 7.8% when the MTTF requirement is reduced. We also study how conventional EM fixes using per net Non-Default Rule (NDR) routing, downsizing of drivers, and fanout reduction affect performance at reduced lifetime requirements. Our study indicates, e.g., that NDR routing can increase performance by up to 5% but at the cost of 2% increase in area at a reduced 7-year lifetime requirement."

Simple power gating cannot fully take the chances of power reduction because volatile memories lose data when power is turned off. Recently, new non-volatile memories (NVMs) have appeared.

880197,15237,8335,ECO timing optimization with negotiation-based re-routing and logic re-structuring using spare cells,2012,"To maintain a lower re-masking cost, Engineering Change Order (ECO) using pre-placed spare cells for buffer insertion and gate sizing has been shown to be practical for fixing timing violating paths (ECO paths). However, in the previously known best scheme DCP [1, 2], re-routings are done with each path optimized according to its surrounding available spare cells without considering potential exchanges with neighboring active cells, and spare cell arbitration between competing ECO paths are less addressed. Besides, the extra flexibility for allowing logic restructuring was not exploited. In this work, we develop a framework harnessing the following more flexible strategies to make the usage of spare cells for ECO timing optimization more powerful: (1) a negotiation based re-routing scheme yielding a more global view in solving resource competition arbitration; (2) an extended gate sizing operation to allow exchanges of active gates with spare gates of different function types through equivalent logic re-structuring. Our experiments upon MCNC and ITC benchmarks with highly injected timing violations show that compared to DCP, our newly proposed framework can cut down the average total negative slack (TNS) by 50% and reduce the number of unsolved ECO paths by 31%."
1010921,15237,8335,ShieldUS: A novel design of dynamic shielding for eliminating 3D TSV crosstalk coupling noise,2013,"3D IC is a promising technology to meet the demands of high throughput, high scalability, and low power consumption for future generation integrated circuits. One way to implement the 3D IC is to interconnect layers of two-dimensional (2D) IC with Through-Silicon Via (TSV), which shortens the signal lengths. Unfortunately, while TSVs are bundled together as a cluster, the crosstalk coupling noise may lead to transmission errors. As a result, the working frequency of TSVs has to be lowered to avoid the errors, leading to narrower bandwidth that TSVs can provide. In this paper, we first derive the crosstalk noise model from the perspective of 3D chip and then propose ShieldUS, a runtime data-to-TSVs remapping strategy. With ShieldUS, the transition patterns of data over TSVs are observed at runtime, and relatively stable bits will be mapped to the TSVs which act as shields to protect the other bits which have more fluctuations. We evaluate the performance of ShieldUS with address lines from real benchmark traces and data lines of different similarities. The results show that ShieldUS is accurate and flexible. We further study dynamic shielding and our design of Interval Equilibration Unit (IEU) can intelligently select suitable parameters for dynamic shielding, which makes dynamic shielding practical and does not need to predefine parameters. This also improves the practicability of ShieldUS."
1197556,15237,8335,Design of a clock jitter reduction circuit using gated phase blending between self-delayed clock edges,2013,"Design of a clock jitter reduction circuit that exploits the phase blending technique between the uncorrelated clock edges that are self-delayed by multiples of the clock cycle, nT is presented. By blending uncorrelated clock edges, the output clock edges approach the ideal timing and, thus, timing jitter can be reduced by a factor of √2 per stage. There are three technical challenges to realize this: 1) generating uncorrelated clock edges, 2) phase averaging with small time offset from the ideal center position, and 3) minimizing the error in nT-delay being deviated from ideal nT. The proposed circuit overcomes each of these by exploiting an nT-delay, gated phase blending, and self-calibrated nT-delay elements, respectively. Measurement results with a 180-nm CMOS prototype chip demonstrated an approximately four-fold reduction in timing jitter from 30.2 ps to 8.8 ps in 500-MHz clock by cascading the proposed circuit with four-stages."
888852,15237,8335,Equivalent circuit model extraction for interconnects in 3D ICs,2013,"Parasitic RC behavior of VLSI interconnects has been the major bottleneck in terms of latency and power consumption of ICs. Recent 3D ICs promise to reduce the parasitic RC effect by making use of through silicon vias (TSVs). It is therefore essential to extract the RC model of TSVs to assess their promise. Unlike interconnects on metal layers, TSVs exhibit slow-wave and dielectric quasi-transverse-electromagnetic (TEM) modes due to the coupling to the semiconducting substrate. This TSV behavior can be simulated using analytical methods, 2D electrostatic simulators, or 3D full-wave electromagnetic simulators. In this paper, we describe a methodology to extract parasitic RC models from such simulation data for interconnects in a 3D IC."
1629853,15237,8335,DPA: A data pattern aware error prevention technique for NAND flash lifetime extension,2014,"The recent research reveals that the bit error rate of a NAND flash cell is highly dependent on the stored data patterns. In this work, we propose Data Pattern Aware (DPA) error protection technique to extend the lifespan of NAND flash based storage systems (NFSS). DPA manipulates the ratio of 1's and 0's in the stored data to minimize occurrence of the data patterns which are susceptible to bit error noise. Consequently, the NAND flash cell bit error rate is reduced, leading to system endurance extension. Our simulation result shows that, with marginal hardware and power overhead, DPA scheme can increase the NFSS lifetime by up to 4×, offering a complementing solution to other lifetime enhancement techniques like wear-leveling."

On the other hand, it is well known that application behavior has major impacts on the masking (or “derating” factor) in system SER calculations. The principal goal of this project is to understand the interaction between BG/Q hardware and high-performance applications when it comes to SER by performing and evaluating a chip irradiation experiment."

With the recent advancements, it is foreseen that nanophotonics holds the promise to be employed for future on-chip data signalling due to its unique power efficiency, signal delay and huge multiplexing potential. However, there are major challenges to address before feasible on-chip integration could be reached. In this paper, we present GLOW, a hybrid global router to provide low power opto-electronic interconnect synthesis under the considerations of thermal reliability and various physical design constraints such as optical power, delay and signal quality. GLOW is evaluated with testing cases derived from ISPD07-08 global routing benchmarks. Compared with a greedy approach, GLOW demonstrates around 23%–50% of total optical power reduction, revealing great potential of on-chip WDM interconnect synthesis."
1501598,15237,8335,Relaxed synchronization technique for speeding-up the parallel simulation of multiprocessor systems,2012,"For design verification of an MPSoC, a virtual prototyping system has been widely used as a cheap and fast method without a hardware prototype. It usually consists of component simulators working together in a single simulation host. As the number of component simulators increases, the simulation performance degrades significantly due to occurrence of frequent inter-simulator communication. In this paper, to boost up the simulation speed further, we propose a novel technique, called relaxed synchronization, which uses a simulation cache at each component simulator for simulation purpose. Like an architectural cache that reduces the main memory access frequency, a simulation cache reduces the count of synchronous communication effectively between the corresponding component simulator and the simulation backplane. When a read or write request to a shared memory is made, a cache line, not a single element, is transferred to utilize the space and temporal locality for simulation. The proposed technique is based on an assumption that the application program uses a relaxed memory model. Through experiments with real-life applications, it is proved that the proposed approach improves the simulation performance by up to 330 %."

Accuracy and runtime enhancement techniques are proposed, making our detection methodology robust and efficient as a fast physical verification tool that can be applied during early design stages to large-scale designs. We position our method as an approximate detection solution, similar to pattern matching-based tools widely adopted by the industry. In addition, our analyses of classification results reveal that the majority of non-hotspots falsely predicted as hotspots have printed CD barely over the minimum allowable CD threshold. Our method is verified on several 45 nm  and 32 nm  industrial designs."

This paper develops a structured shooting algorithm that can fully take advantage of parallelism in periodic steady state (PSS) analysis. Utilizing periodic structure of the state matrix of RF/ MM-IC simulation, a cyclic-block-structured shooting-Newton method has been parallelized and mapped onto recent GPU platforms. We first present the formulation of the parallel cyclic-block-structured shooting-Newton algorithm, called periodic Arnoldi shooting method. Then we will present its parallel implementation details on GPU. Results from several industrial examples show that the structured parallel shooting-Newton method on Tesla's GPU can lead to speedups of more than 20× compared to the state-of-the-art implicit GMRES methods under the same accuracy on the CPU."

In this work, we propose a pattern shift-aware metric called critical density, which can quickly evaluate the robustness of EUV layouts to mask defects (300-1300x faster than Monte Carlo, with average mask yield root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.08%-6.44%), thereby enabling design-level mask defect mitigation techniques. Our experimental results indicate that reducing layout regularity improves the ability of layouts to tolerate mask defects via pattern shift."

Because circuit area is an essential factor of reliability, especially for such unreliable post-silicon devices, it is desired to build small circuits which can reuse as many today's application programs as possible even if the performance is not very high. This paper presents the very first work to study novel, efficient techniques of emulating wider-bit guest processors (e.g., 32-bit) on a narrower-bit host processor (e.g., 8-bit) with very limited hardware resources while mitigating performance degradation. We propose three types of emulator-oriented tiny processors varying in available hardware resources and reliability enhancement approaches. Quantitative evaluation and discussions are done for comparing those three processors. We believe that this work will will be a good help of making breakthrough for further development of new device technologies and computers based on them."

1975870,15237,8335,A provably good approximation algorithm for rectangle escape problem with application to PCB routing,2011,"In this paper, we introduce and study the Rectangle Escape Problem (REP), which is motivated by PCB bus escape routing. Given a rectangular region  R  and a set  S  of rectangles within  R , the REP is to choose a direction for each rectangle to escape to the boundary of  R , such that the resultant maximum density over  R  is minimized. We prove that the REP is NP-Complete, and show that it can be formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). A provably good approximation algorithm for the REP is developed by applying Linear Programming (LP) relaxation and a special rounding technique to the ILP. This approximation algorithm is also shown to work for a more general version of REP with weights (weighted REP). In addition, an iterative refinement procedure is proposed as a postprocessing step to further improve the results. Our approach is tested on a set of industrial PCB bus escape routing problems. Experimental results show that the optimal solution can be obtained within 3 seconds for each of the test cases."

In this paper, we consider monobit digital receivers for QPSK modulation. First, the optimal monobit receiver under Nyquist sampling is derived. Its performance is calculated in the form of deflection ratio. Then a suboptimal but low-complexity monobit receiver is obtained. The impact of the phase offset is investigated, and the interface with error-control decoder is given.

2230295,15237,8335,Parallel cross-layer optimization of high-level synthesis and physical design,2011,"Integrated circuit (IC) design automation has traditionally followed a hierarchical approach. Modern IC design flow is divided into sequentially-addressed design and optimization layers; each successively finer in design detail and data granularity while increasing in computational complexity. Eventual agreement across the design layers signals design closure. Obtaining design closure is a continual problem, as lack of awareness and interaction between layers often results in multiple design flow iterations. In this work, we propose parallel cross-layer optimization, in which the boundaries between design layers are broken, allowing for a more informed and efficient exploration of the design space. We leverage the heterogeneous parallel computational power in current and upcoming multi-core/many-core computation platforms to suite the heterogeneous characteristics of multiple design layers. Specifically, we unify the highlevel and physical synthesis design layers for parallel cross-layer IC design optimization. In addition, we introduce a massively-parallel GPU floorplanner with local and global convergence test as the proposed physical synthesis design layer.

With the consideration of nonlinear phase noise macromodel, this paper introduces a forward reachability analysis with stable backward correction for PLL system-level verification with jitter. By refining initial state of PLL through backward correction, one can perform an efficient PLL verification to automatically adjust the locking range with consideration of environmental noise induced jitter. Moreover, to overcome the unstable nature during backward correction, a stability calibration is introduced in this paper to limit error. To validate our method, the proposed approach is applied to verify a number of PLL designs including single-LC or coupled-LC oscillators described by system-level behavioral model with jitter. Experimental results show that our forward reachability analysis with backward correction can succeed in reaching the adjusted locking range by correcting initial states in presence of environmental noise induced jitter."

These algorithms do not mandate absolute correctness of their results, and imprecise circuit components can therefore leverage this relaxed fidelity requirement to provide performance and energy benefits. In this paper, several imprecise adder design techniques are classified and compared in terms of their error characteristics and power-delay efficiency. A general methodology for fidelity-efficiency design space exploration is presented and is applied to a case study implementing the CORDIC algorithm in 130nm technology. The case study reveals that simple precision scaling often provides better power-delay efficiency for a given fidelity than more complex imprecise adders, but different choice of algorithm and fidelity can influence the outcome."

The proposed decoding is based on two methods: hybrid sliding window and dynamic metric encoding. The new window scheme combines dummy metric calculation and border metric storing methods to halve the border metric memory and improve the error-correcting performance for multi-rate codes. The dynamic encoding of metrics also significantly reduces the border metric memory without degrading the performance. Employing the two proposed methods reduces the conventional border metric memory by 83%. In addition, the superb error-correcting performance of the proposed method is verified for various code rates by conducting intensive simulations for 3GPP LTE codes."

By this effect, a SPAD translates an incoming photon to a macroscopic current pulse. These devices are currently used for building medical devices characterized by a very high time resolution. An appealing application of SPAD is to use them as a basic block for building the entropy source of true random number generators. In this paper we focus on such application, and we explore the design challenges behind the realization of a quantum random number generator based on a massively parallel array of SPADs. The matrix under investigation comprises 512×128 independent cells that convert photons onto a raw bit-stream, which, as ensured by the properties of quantum physics, is characterized by a very high level of randomness. The sequences are read out in a 128-bit parallel bus, concatenated, and pipelined onto a de-biasing filter. Subsequently, we fabricated the proposed chip using a standard CMOS process. Our results, achieved on the manufactured device and coupling two matrices, show that our architecture can reach up to 5 Gbit/s while consuming 25pJ/bit, thus demonstrating scalability and performance for any random number generators based on SPADs."

1435307,15237,8335,Clock rescheduling for timing engineering change orders,2012,"With increasing circuit complexities, design bugs are commonly found in late design stages, and thus engineering change orders (ECOs) have become an indispensable process in modern VLSI design. Most prior approaches to the timing ECO problem are concerned about combinational logic optimization. In contrast, this paper addresses the problem in the sequential domain to explore more optimization flexibility. We propose an orthogonal method of post-mask clock scheduling with spare cells. Compared to traditional clock scheduling, clock scheduling in the ECO stage is more challenging in that it confronts limited spare-cell resources and dynamic changes of wiring cost incurred by different spare-cell selections. Based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), our formulation considers not only gate sizing and buffer insertion using spare cells, but also wire snaking. Experimental results based on five industrial designs show the effectiveness of our work. Our framework has been integrated into a commercial design flow."
2046783,15237,8335,Robust clock tree synthesis with timing yield optimization for 3D-ICs,2011,"3D integration has new manufacturing and design challenges such as timing corner mismatch between tiers and device variation due to Through Silicon Via (TSV) induced stress. Timing corner mismatch between tiers is caused because each tier is manufactured in independent process. Therefore, inter-die variation should be considered to analyze and optimize for paths spreading over several tiers. TSV induced stress is another challenge in 3D Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS). Mobility variation of a clock buffer due to stress from TSV can cause unexpected skew which degrades overall chip performance. In this paper, we propose clock tree design methodology with the following objectives: (a) to minimize clock period variation by assigning optimal z-location of clock buffers with an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation, (b) to prevent unwanted skew induced by the stress. In the results, we show that our clock buffer tier assignment reduces clock period variation up to 34.2%, and the most of stress-induced skew can be removed by our stress-aware CTS. Overall, we show that performance gain can be up to 5.7% with our robust 3D CTS."

At the same time, 3D integration emerges as a promising technology for high density integration. 3D homogeneous MPSoCs combine the benefits of both. However, high current demand and large on-chip switching activity variations introduce severe power supply noises (PSN) for 3D MPSoCs, which can increase critical path delay, and degrade chip performance and reliability. Meanwhile, thermal gradient should also be considered for 3D MPSoCs to avoid hot spots. In the paper, we investigate the PSN effects of different workloads and propose an effective PSN estimation method. Then, a heuristic workload assignment algorithm is proposed to suppress PSN under the given thermal constraint. The experimental results show that PSNs can be reduced significantly compared with thermal-balanced workload assignment scheme, and the system performance can be improved as well."

Tasks are scheduled using fixed-priority preemptive scheduling, while replication is used for recovery from multiple transient faults. Addressing energy and reliability simultaneously is especially challenging, since lowering the voltage to reduce the energy consumption has been shown to increase the transient fault rate.

2413622,15237,8335,Design techniques for functional-unit power gating in the Ultra-Low-Voltage region,2012,"In order to combat the exponentially growing leakage current in modern microprocessors, researchers have recently focused on very fine-grained functional unit power gating in which units of a microprocessor, including components of the ALU and floating point processor, are quickly shut off when not in use. This method is especially effective for Ultra-Low-Voltage (ULV) processors, where the slower clock periods makes leakage especially severe. In this paper, we investigate many of the important aspects of highly aggressive functional unit power gating in the context of ULV operation. Using an optimization framework, we demonstrate that functional unit power gating with an Ideal Policy results in an average of a 39.3% drop in total functional unit energy across a range of benchmarks. Next, we examine two very simple hardware-based power gating policies that achieve near-ideal results with very little overhead. Finally, we compare a newer style of ultra-low-voltage logic, Sense-Amplifier Pass Transistor Logic (SAPTL), to CMOS and show that it requires footers that are an eighth of the size and consumes about 100 times less energy on boot-up. With this lower overhead, total energy is reduced by 49.6%."

2098846,15237,339,On the vulnerability of FPGA bitstream encryption against power analysis attacks: extracting keys from xilinx Virtex-II FPGAs,2011,"Over the last two decades FPGAs have become central components for many advanced digital systems, e.g., video signal processing, network routers, data acquisition and military systems. In order to protect the intellectual property and to prevent fraud, e.g., by cloning a design embedded into an FPGA or manipulating its content, many current FPGAs employ a bitstream encryption feature. We develop a successful attack on the bitstream encryption engine integrated in the widespread Virtex-II Pro FPGAs from Xilinx, using side-channel analysis. After measuring the power consumption of a single power-up of the device and a modest amount of off-line computation, we are able to recover all three different keys used by its triple DES module. Our method allows extracting secret keys from any real-world device where the bitstream encryption feature of Virtex-II Pro is enabled. As a consequence, the target product can be cloned and manipulated at the will of the attacker since no side-channel protection was included into the design of the decryption module. Also, more advanced attacks such as reverse engineering or the introduction of hardware Trojans become potential threats. While performing the side-channel attack, we were able to deduce a hypothetical architecture of the hardware encryption engine. To our knowledge, this is the first attack against the bitstream encryption of a commercial FPGA reported in the open literature."

The complexity of the reliability analysis arises in handling the sequential feedback that make the system output depends not only on the present input but also the internal state. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model, named sequential dependency model (SDM), for the reliability analysis of embedded systems with sequential feedback. It is constructed based on the structure of the system components and the signals among them. We prove that the SDM model is s Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) that captures: the spatial dependencies between system components in a single time slice, the temporal dependencies between system components of different time slices, and the temporal dependencies due to the sequential feedback. We initiate the conditional probability distribution (CPD) table of the SDM node with the failure probability of the corresponding system component. Then, the SDM model handles the spatial-temporal correlations at internal components as well as the higher order temporal correlations due to the sequential feedback with the computational mechanism of DBN, experiment results demonstrate the accuracy of our model."

However, in modern VLSI designs, pins are located in multiple routing layers, each routing layer has its own preferred direction, and there exist numerous routing obstacles incurred from IP blocks, power networks, pre-routed nets, etc, which make us need to consider multilayer obstacle-avoiding preferred direction rectilinear Steiner minimal tree (ML-OAPDRSMT) problem. This significantly increases the complexity of the problem, and an efficient and effective algorithm to deal with the problem is desired. In this paper, we propose a very simple and effective approach to deal with ML-OAPDRSMT problem. Unlike previous works usually build a spanning graph and find a spanning tree to deal with this problem, which takes a lot of time, we first determine a connection ordering for all pins, and then iteratively connect every two neighboring pins by a greedy heuristic algorithm.

To handle the interface issue of connections, the inter-die routing, which uses micro bumps and two single-layer RDLs (Re-Distribution Layers) to achieve the connection between adjacent dies, is adopted. In this paper, we present an inter-die routing algorithm for 3D ICs with a pre-defined netlist. Our algorithm is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and adopts a two-stage technique of micro-bump assignment followed by non-regular RDL routing. First, the micro-bump assignment selects suitable micro-bumps for the pre-defined netlist such that no crossing problem exists inside the bounding boxes of each net. After the micro-bump assignment, the netlist is divided into two sub-netlists, one is for the upper RDL and the other is for the lower RDL. Second, the non-regular RDL routing determines minimum and non-crossing global paths for sub-netlists in the upper and lower RDLs individually. Experimental results show that our approach can obtain optimal wirelength and achieve 100% routability under reasonable CPU times."

However, once a piece of code is determined to be unreachable, diagnosing the cause of the problem can be challenging: since the code is unreachable, no counterexample can be returned for debugging. Therefore, engineers need to analyze the legality of nonexistent execution paths, which can be difficult. To address such a problem, we analyzed the cause of unreachability in several industrial designs and proposed a diagnosis technique that can explain the cause of unreachability. In addition, our method provides suggestions on how to solve the un-reachability problem, which can further facilitate debugging. Our experimental results show that this technique can greatly reduce an engineer's effort in analyzing unreachable code."

1593394,15237,8335,Layer minimization in escape routing for staggered-pin-array PCBs,2013,"As the technology advances, the pin number of a high-end PCB design keeps increasing. The staggered pin array is used to accommodate a larger pin number than the grid pin array of the same area. Nevertheless, escaping a large pin number to the boundary of a dense staggered pin array, namely multilayer escape routing for staggered pin arrays, is significantly harder than that for grid pin arrays. This paper addresses this multilayer escape routing problem to minimize the number of used layers in a staggered pin array for manufacturing cost reduction. We first present an escaped pin selection method to assign a maximal number of escaped pins in the current layer and also to increase useful routing regions for subsequent layers. Missing pins are also modeled in our routing network to utilize the routing resource effectively. Experimental results show that our approach can significantly reduce the required layer number for escape routing."
1827184,15237,8335,Row-based area-array I/O design planning in concurrent chip-package design flow,2011,"IC-centric design flow has been a common paradigm when designing and optimizing a system. Package and board/system designs are usually followed by almost-ready chip designs, which causes long turn-around time communicating with package and system houses. In this paper, the realizations of area-array I/O design methodologies are studied. Different from IC-centric flow, we propose a chip-package concurrent design flow to speed up the design time. Along with the flow, we design the I/O-bump (and P/G-bump) tile which combines I/O (and P/G) and bump into a hard macro with the considerations of I/O power connection and electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection. We then employ an I/O-row based scheme to place I/O-bump tiles with existed metal layers. By such a scheme, it reduces efforts in I/O placement legalization and the redistribution layer (RDL) routing. With the emphasis on package design awareness, the proposed methods map package balls onto chip I/Os, thus providing an opportunity to design chip and package in parallel. Due to this early study of I/O and bump planning, faster convergence can be expected with concurrent design flow. The results are encouraging and the merits of this flow are reassuring."
1147429,15237,8335,Network flow modeling for escape routing on staggered pin arrays,2013,"Recently staggered pin arrays are introduced for modern designs with high pin density. Although some studies have been done on escape routing for hexagonal arrays, the hexagonal array is only a special kind of staggered pin array. There exist other kinds of staggered pin arrays in current industrial designs, and the existing works cannot be extended to solve them. In this paper, we study the escape routing problem on staggered pin arrays. Network flow models are proposed to correctly model the capacity constraints of staggered pin arrays. Our models are guaranteed to find an escape routing satisfying the capacity constraints if there exists one. The correctness of these models lead to an optimal algorithm."
1302725,15237,8335,I-LUTSim: An iterative look-up table based thermal simulator for 3-D ICs,2013,"This work presents an iterative look-up table based thermal simulator, I-LUTSim, to efficiently estimate the temperature profile of three-dimensional integrated circuits. I-LUTSim includes two stages. First, the pre-process stage constructs thermal impulse response tables. Then, the simulation stage iteratively calculates the temperature profile via the table lookup. With this two-stage scheme, the maximum absolute error of I-LUTSim is less than 0.41% compared with that of a commercial tool ANSYS. Moreover, I-LUTSim is at least an order of magnitude faster than a fast matrix solver SuperLU [1] for the full-chip temperature simulation."
1393899,15237,8335,Online estimation of the remaining energy capacity in mobile systems considering system-wide power consumption and battery characteristics,2013,"Emerging mobile systems integrate a lot of functionality into a small form factor with a small energy source in the form of rechargeable battery. This situation necessitates accurate estimation of the remaining energy in the battery such that user applications can be judicious on how they consume this scarce and precious resource. This paper thus focuses on estimating the remaining battery energy in Android OS-based mobile systems. This paper proposes to instrument the Android kernel in order to collect and report accurate subsystem activity values based on real-time profiling of the running applications. The activity information along with offline-constructed, regression-based power macro models for major subsystems in the smartphone yield the power dissipation estimate for the whole system. Next, while accounting for the rate-capacity effect in batteries, the total power dissipation data is translated into the battery's energy depletion rate, and subsequently, used to compute the battery's remaining lifetime based on its current state of charge information. Finally, this paper describes a novel application design framework, which considers the batterys state-of-charge (SOC), batterys energy depletion rate, and service quality of the target application. The benefits of the design framework are illustrated by examining an archetypical case, involving the design space exploration and optimization of a GPS-based application in an Android OS."
2181084,15237,8335,Controlling NBTI degradation during static burn-in testing,2011,"Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) has emerged as the dominant PMOS device failure mechanism in the nanometer VLSI era. The extent of NBTI degradation of a PMOS device increases dramatically at elevated operating temperature and supply voltage. Unfortunately, both these conditions are concurrently experienced by a VLSI chip during the process of burn-in testing. Our analysis shows that even with a short burn-in duration of 10 hours, the degradation accumulated can be as much as 60% of the NBTI degradation experienced over 10 years of use at nominal conditions.  Static  burn-in testing in particular is observed to cause most NBTI degradation due to absence of relaxation phase unlike the case for  dynamic  burn-in testing. The delay of benchmark circuits is observed to increase by over 10% due to static burn-in testing. We propose the first technique to reduce the NBTI degradation during static burn-in test by finding the minimum NBTI induced delay degradation vector (MDDV) based on timing criticality and threshold voltage change (ΔV  TH  ) sensitivity of the cells. Further, only a subset of the input pins need to be controlled for NBTI reduction, thus our technique allows other objectives (such as leakage reduction) to be considered simultaneously. Experimental results show that the NBTI induced critical path delay degradation can be reduced by more than 50% using our proposed technique."
1975179,15237,8335,Path criticality computation in parameterized statistical timing analysis,2011,"This paper presents a method to compute criticality probabilities of paths in parameterized statistical static timing analysis (SSTA). We partition the set of all the paths into several groups and formulate the path criticality into a joint probability of inequalities. Before evaluating the joint probability directly, we simplify the inequalities through algebraic elimination, handling topological correlation. Our proposed method uses conditional probabilities to obtain the joint probability, and statistics of random variables representing process parameters are changed due to given conditions. To calculate the conditional statistics of the random variables, we derive analytic formulas by extending Clark's work. This allows us to obtain the conditional probability density function of a path delay, given the path is critical, as well as to compute criticality probabilities of paths. Our experimental results show that the proposed method provides 4.2X better accuracy on average in comparison to the state-of-art method."
1252589,15237,8335,General purpose cross-referencing Microfluidic Biochip with reduced pin-count,2014,The number of control pins used is a major factor affecting the manufacturing cost of Digital Microfluidic Biochip (DMFB). Pin-count on a DMFB can be reduced by sharing of control pins between electrodes. Most existing works on reducing pin-count are problem specific. Problem specific optimizations result in DMFB that can only perform certain specific bioassays. Cross-Referencing DMFB has a full array layout that is fully reconfigurable for any bioassay. Conventional Cross-Referencing DMFB uses m + n number of pins. We have devised a non-problem specific pin assignment methodology that uses only √2(√m + √n) number of pins. The resulting DMFB are still fully reconfigurable. We have developed a droplet router specifically for cross-referencing DMFB with shared control pins. All real bioassay tested can be routed using a fixed and problem independent control pin mapping. Reduction on pin count ranges from 50% to 67%.
2322839,15237,8335,Fast data-cache modeling for native co-simulation,2011,"Efficient design of large multiprocessor embedded systems requires fast, early performance modeling techniques. Native co-simulation has been proposed as a fast solution for evaluating systems in early design steps. Annotated SW execution can be performed in conjunction with a virtual model of the HW platform to generate a complete system simulation. To obtain sufficiently accurate performance estimations, the effect of all the system components, as processor caches, must be considered. ISS-based cache models slow down the simulation speed, greatly reducing the efficiency of native-based co-simulations. To solve the problem, cache modeling techniques for fast native co-simulation have been proposed, but only considering instruction-caches. In this paper, a fast technique for datacache modeling is presented, together with the instrumentation required for its application in native execution. The model allows the designer to obtain cache hit/miss rate estimations with a speed-up of two orders of magnitude with respect to ISS. Miss rate estimation error remains below 5% for representative examples."
1847178,15237,8335,A 4.32 mm 2 170mW LDPC decoder in 0.13μm CMOS for WiMax/Wi-Fi applications,2011,"An energy-efficient programmable LDPC decoder is proposed for WiMax and Wi-Fi applications. The proposed decoder is designed with overlapped processing units, flexible message passing network and medium-grain partitioned memories to achieve flexibility, area reduction, and energy efficiency. The decoder can be programmed by host processor with several special-purpose micro-instructions. Thus, various operation modes can be reconfigured. Fabricated in SMIC 0.13μm 1P8M CMOS process, the chip occupies 4.32 mm 2  with core area 2.97 mm 2 , and consumes 170mW with a throughput of 302Mb/s when operating at 145MHz and 1.2V."
1617886,15237,8335,Multi-mode trace signal selection for post-silicon debug,2014,"Trace buffers are used during post-silicon debug to increase the visibility to the internal signals of a chip via online tracing of a few state elements within a capture window. Due to the small bandwidth of the trace buffer, only a few state elements can be selected or tracing in order to restore the states of the remaining state elements as many as possible. In this work, we show that the quality of restoration corresponding to a set of trace signals selected for a single operating mode, may significantly degrade over the remaining operating modes of a design; an operating mode refers to specific values taken by control signals such as signals for mode selection and scan enable. This is the first work to study the multi-mode trace signal selection problem in order to maximize the restoration over all the operating modes of a design. We propose algorithmic strategies for this problem as well as a procedure to reduce the number of modes by merging the ones with “similar” restoration maps; merging improves the runtime scalability of our multi-mode trace selection algorithm with increase in the number of modes, without much loss in the solution quality."
1220703,15237,8335,Automated data analysis techniques for a modern silicon debug environment,2012,"With the growing size of modern designs and more strict time-to-market constraints, design errors unavoidably escape pre-silicon verification and reside in silicon prototypes. As a result, silicon debug has become a necessary step in the digital integrated circuit design flow. Although embedded hardware blocks, such as scan chains and trace buffers, provide a means to acquire data of internal signals in real time for debugging, there is a relative shortage in methodologies to efficiently analyze this vast data to identify root-causes. This paper presents an automated software solution that attempts to fill-in the gap. The presented techniques automate the configuration process for trace-buffer based hardware in order to acquire helpful information for debugging the failure, and detect suspects of the failure in both the spatial and temporal domain."

2168681,15237,8335,Secure scan design using shift register equivalents against differential behavior attack,2011,"There is a need for an efficient design-for-testability to satisfy both testability and security of digital circuits. In our previous work, we reported a secure and testable scan design approach by using extended shift registers that are functionally equivalent but not structurally equivalent to shift registers, and showed a security level by clarifying the cardinality of those classes of shift register equivalents (SR equivalents). However, SR equivalents are not always secure for scan-based side-channel attacks. In this paper, we consider a scan-based side-channel attack called differential-behavior attack and propose several classes of SR-equivalent scan circuits using dummy flip-flops in order to protect the scan-based differential-behavior attack. To show the security level of those extended scan circuits, we introduce differential-behavior equivalent relation, and clarify the number of SR-equivalent extended scan circuits, the number of differential-behavior equivalent classes and the cardinality of those equivalent classes."
1189785,15237,8335,"Mapping complex algorithm into FPGA with High Level Synthesis reconfigurable chips with High Level Synthesis compared with CPU, GPGPU",2014,"This presentation discusses on the comparison between Reconfigurable Chip with High Level Synthesis and CPU, GPCPU with compiler such as CUDA from the compiler perspective. Initially, we introduce several demands for acceleration with FPGA to achieve low latency calculation and control. As an application example, we show a High Frequency Trading. We accelerate it by FPGA NIC with C-based and SQL-based HLS, and show the necessity of high level language customizable reconfigurable chip. Then, we illustrate the difference of FPGA and processor (CPU, GPGPU) with the FSM+Datapath model and examine how the architecture difference affects delay and parallelism of operations. Next, we discuss parallelization of operations, threads with High Level Synthesis for FPGA and software compiler for processors. The main advantage of the former method is it is able to parallelize operations beyond control dependencies while the latter method has to obey control dependencies. Finally, some experimental results prove that FPGA and HLS generate better performance than a processor for control intensive algorithm."

2538171,15237,8335,Robust spatial correlation extraction with limited sample via L1-norm penalty,2011,"Random process variations are often composed of location dependent part and distance dependent correlated part. While an accurate extraction of process variation is a prerequisite of both process improvement and circuit performance prediction, it is not an easy task to characterize such complicated spatial random process from a limited number of silicon data. For this purpose, kriging model was introduced to silicon society. This work forms a modified kriging model with  L  1 -norm penalty which offers improved robustness. With the help of Least Angle Regression (LAR) in solving a core optimization sub-problem, this model can be characterized efficiently. Some promising results are presented with numerical experiments where a 3X improvement in model accuracy is shown."
2252817,15237,8335,Register pressure aware scheduling for high level synthesis,2011,"Variations of list scheduling became the de-facto standard of scheduling straight line code in software compilers, a trend faithfully inherited by high-level synthesis solutions. Due to its nature, list scheduling is oblivious of the tightly coupled register pressure; a dangling fundamental problem that has been attacked by the compiler community for decades, and which results, in case of highlevel synthesis, in excessive instantiations of registers and accompanying steering logic.   To alleviate this problem, we propose a synthesis framework called  soft scheduling , which acts as a resource unconstrained prescheduling stage that restricts subsequent scheduling to minimize register pressure. This optimization objective is formulated as a live range minimization problem, a measure shown to be proportional to register pressure, and optimally solved in polynomial time using minimum cost network flow formulation. Unlike past solutions in the compiler community, which try to reduce register pressure by local serialization of subject instructions, the proposed solution operates on the entire basic block or hyperblock and systematically handles instruction chaining subject to the same objective.   The application of the proposed solution to a set of real-life benchmarks results in a register pressure reduction ranging, on average, between 11% and 41% depending on the compilation and synthesis configurations with minor 2% to 4% increase in schedule latency."
1555185,15237,8335,BOB-router: A new buffering-aware global router with over-the-block routing resources optimization,2014,"In this paper, we propose a new global router, BOB-Router, endowed with the ability to use over-the-block routing resources to the greatest extent in addition to traditional routing concepts of minimizing wirelength, via count and overflow. In previous global routing formulations, the routing resources over the IP blocks were either dealt as routing blockages leading to a significant waste, or simply treated in the same way as outside-the-block routing resources, which violates the slew constraints and thus fail buffering. Utilizing over-the-block routing resources could dramatically improve the routing solution, yet requires special attention, since the slew, affected by different RC on different metal layers, must be constrained by buffering and is easily violated. Moreover, even all nets are slew-legalized, the routing solution could still suffer from heavy congestion problem. For the first time, BOB-Router tries to solve the over-the-block global routing problem through minimizing overflows, wirelength and via count simultaneously without violating slew constraints. BOB-Router generates a slew-legalized initial solution followed by a Lagrangian-multiplier-based pricing phase and RC-constrained A* search to help explore new buffering-aware topologies on all metal layers. Our experimental results show that BOB-Router completely satisfies the slew constraints and significantly outperforms the obstacle-avoiding global routers in terms of wirelength, via count and overflows."
1605619,15237,8335,Simplification of C-RTL equivalent checking for fused multiply add unit using intermediate models,2013,"The functionality of Fused multiply add (FMA) design can be formally verified by comparing its register transition level (RTL) implementation against its system level specification often modeled by C/C++ language using sequential equivalent checking (SEC). However, C-RTL SEC does not scale for FMA because of the huge discrepancy existed between the two models. This paper analyzes the dissimilarities and proposes two intermediate models, one abstract RTL and one rewritten C model to bridge the gap. The original SEC proof are partitioned into three sub-proofs among intermediate models where a variety of simplification techniques are applied to further reduce the complexity. Experiments from an industry project show that with the two intermediate models, the SEC proof is complete and scalable for FMA design."
1781127,15237,8335,Comprehensive die-level assessment of design rules and layouts,2014,"Co-development of design rules and layout methodologies is the key to successful adoption of a technology. In this work, we propose Chip-level Design Rule Evaluator (ChipDRE), the first framework for systematic evaluation of design rules and their interaction with layouts, performance, margins and yield at the chip scale (as opposed to standard cell-level). A “good chips per wafer” metric is used to unify area, performance, variability and yield. The framework uses a generated virtual standard-cell library coupled with a mix of physical design, semi-empirical, and machine-learning-based models to estimate area and delay at the chip level. The result is a unified design-quality estimate that can be computed fast enough to allow using ChipDRE to optimize a large number of complex design rules. For instance, a study of well-to-active spacing rule reveals a non-monotone dependence of rule value to chip area (although the dependence to cell area is monotone) due to delay changes coming from well-proximity effect."
1620158,15237,8335,The stochastic modeling of TiO 2 memristor and its usage in neuromorphic system design,2014,"Memristor, the fourth basic circuit element, has shown great potential in neuromorphic circuit design for its unique synapse-like feature. However, though the continuous resistance state of memristor has been expected, obtaining and maintaining an arbitrary intermediate state cannot be well controlled in nowadays memristive system. In addition, the stochastic switching behaviors have been widely observed. To facilitate the investigation on memristor-based hardware implementation, we built a stochastic behavior model of TiO 2  memristive devices based on the real experimental results. By leveraging the stochastic behavior of memristors, a macro cell design composed of multiple parallel connecting memristors can be successfully used in implementing the weight storage unit and the stochastic neuron - the two fundamental components in neural network (NN)s, providing a feasible solution in memristor-based hardware implementation."

This coupling effect should not be neglected especially as metal area is intentionally increased in order to reduce resistance values. In this paper, we illustrate how to build the CNIM model and incorporate it into power distribution networks. The CNIM model is validated by comparing our results to the one obtained from a full-wave simulator. The differences between two approaches are within 5% but our computation time is shorter than that required by a full-wave simulator."

This paper proposes a new wakeup scheme utilizing an on-chip detector which continuously monitors the power supply noise in real time. Therefore, this scheme is able to dynamically throttle the wakeup sequence according to ambient voltage level. As a result, even the adjacent active circuit blocks induce an unexpectedly high voltage drop, the possibility of the occurrence of excessive voltage drop is reduced significantly."
2189347,15237,8335,Managing complexity in design debugging with sequential abstraction and refinement,2011,"Design debugging is becoming an increasingly difficult task in the VLSI design flow with the growing size of modern designs and their error traces. In this work, a novel abstraction and refinement technique for design debugging is presented that addresses two key components of the debugging complexity, the design size and the error trace length. The abstraction technique works by under-approximating the debugging problem by removing modules of the original design and replacing them with simulated values of the erroneous circuit. After each abstract problem is solved, the refinement strategy uses the resulting UNSAT core to direct which modules should be refined. This refinement strategy is extended by allowing refinement of across time-frames in addition to modules. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to return solutions for all instances compared to only 41% without the technique demonstrating the viability of this approach in tackling real-world debugging problems."

However, such solution inevitably encounters challenges in thermal dissipation since stacked dies generate significant amount of heat per unit volume. We leverage an integrated architecture of stacked-signal-TSVs to minimize temperature with small wiring overhead. Based on the structure of stacked signal TSV, a two-stage TSV locating algorithm in global routing is designed. By this TSV locating algorithm, we demonstrate that our stacking signal TSV structure is able to reduce 17% temperature with 4% wiring overhead and 3% performance loss calculated by 3D Elmore delay model. Compared to a previous work by Cong and Zhang [1] where additional thermal TSVs are inserted, our experimental results have in average 23% less TSVs than Cong and Zhang's [1] with the same temperature constraint."
2571871,15237,8335,SoC HW/SW verification and validation,2011,"In modern SoC design flow, verification and validation are key components to reduce time-to-market and enhance product quality. To avoid trade-offs between timing accuracy and simulation speed in RTL simulation and C++/SystemC virtual prototyping, FPGA prototyping has become a better choice in the design flow. However, the time-consuming bring-up procedure and insufficient debugging visibility has impaired its potential strengths in verification and validation. In this paper, we present the technology from InPA Systems in which four different modes of operations, RTL-FPGA co-simulation, SystemC-FPGA co-emulation, vector prototyping, and in-circuit prototyping, are supported. With these different modes of FPGA operations, users can develop and verify their SoCs in different stages of the design flow with different abstraction levels.

It can guarantee reliable computation using unreliable devices. In stochastic computing, the linear Finite State Machine (FSM) can be used to implement some sophisticated functions, such as the exponentiation and tanh functions, more efficiently than combinational logic. However, a general approach about how to synthesize a linear FSM-based SCE for a target function has not been available. In this paper, we will introduce three properties of the linear FSM used in stochastic computing and demonstrate a general approach to synthesize a linear FSM-based SCE for a target function. Experimental results show that our approach produces circuits that are much more tolerant of soft errors than deterministic implementations, while the area-delay product of the circuits are less than that of deterministic implementations."

In addition, a through silicon via is modeled with inductive and capacitive parasitic elements and appended to the PDN. Therefore, the circuit related to the 3-D IC technology tends to be a tightly coupled large network. For the simulation of this type of network, an explicit time marching scheme has an advantage over conventional general-purpose circuit simulators such as SPICE in the computational cost. However, the explicit method has a strict numerical stability condition, which may limit the maximum time step size and increase the total amount of the cost. In this work, we propose the method which is explicit, but stable with no stability condition. Additionally, the proposed unconditionally-stable explicit method is accelerated more by combining with an order reduction technique."

HMAX, which is a biologically inspired model of the visual cortex, has been shown to outperform standard computer vision approaches for multi-class object recognition. HMAX, while computationally demanding, can be potentially applied in various applications such as autonomous vehicle navigation, unmanned surveillance and robotics. In this paper, we present a reconfigurable hardware accelerator for the time-consuming S2 stage of the HMAX model. The accelerator leverages spatial parallelism, dedicated wide data buses with on-chip memories to provide an energy efficient solution to enable adoption into embedded systems. We present a systolic array-based architecture which includes a run-time reconfigurable convolution engine which can perform multiple variable-sized convolutions in parallel. An automation flow is described for this accelerator which can generate optimal hardware configurations for a given algorithmic specification and also perform run-time configuration and execution seamlessly.

Both descriptions are represented by finite state machine with datapaths (FSMDs) and are then characterized through finite sets of paths. The main target of our proposed method is to verify scheduling employing code transformations -- such as speculation and common subexpression extraction (CSE), across basic block (BB) boundaries - which have not been properly addressed in the past. Nevertheless, our method can verify typical BB-based and path-based scheduling as well.

They can be realized using Through Silicon Vias (TSVs), or monolithic integration using Monolithic Inter-tier vias (MIVs), an emerging alternative that provides much higher via densities. In this paper, we provide a framework for floorplanning existing 2D IP blocks into 3D-ICs using MIVs. We take the floorplanning solution all the way through place-and-route and report post-layout metrics for area, wirelength, timing, and power consumption. Results show that the wirelength of TSV-based 3D designs outperform 2D designs by upto 14% in large-scale circuits only. MIV-based 3D designs, however, offer an average wirelength improvement of 33% for a wide range of benchmark circuits. We also show that while TSV-based 3D cannot improve the performance and power unless the TSV capacitance is reduced, MIV-based 3D offers significant reduction of upto 33% in the longest path delay and 35% in the inter-block net power."

A unified modeling method is presented for considering both layer assignment and voltage assignment, which achieves the best trade-off between core power and communication power. A 3D NoC synthesis is proposed to assign network components onto each layer and generate inter-layer interconnection. A global redistribution is applied to further reduce communication power.

The method can be used for the evaluation of the execution time of an application program during the system architecture design in an early phase of development. In this phase, information about memory access timings is usually not available. Our method uses a statistical approximation of the memory access timings to estimate their influences on the execution time. We report a preliminary verification of our simulation method by comparing it with an experimental result from an image processing application on a dual-core PC.

Previous researches show that leakage power and delay are both relevant to temperature. The timing-power-temperature dependence will potentially negate the performance improvement of 3D designs. TSV (Through-Silicon-Vias) has been shown as an effective way to help heat removal, but they create routing congestions. Therefore, how to reach the trade-off between temperature, via number and delay is required to be solved. Different from previous works on TSV planning which ignored the effects of leakage power, in this paper, we integrate temperature-leakage-timing dependence into thermal via planning of 3D ICs. A weighted via insertion approach, considering both performance and heat dissipation with resource constraint, is proposed to achieve the best balance among delay, via number and temperature. Experiment results show that, with leakage power and resource constraint considered the temperature and via number required can be quite different, and weighted TSV insertion approach can improve thermal via number, by about 5.6%."
1481967,15237,8335,Escape routing of differential pairs considering length matching,2012,"The escape routing problem for PCB designs has been extensively studied in literature. Although industrial tools and few studies have worked on the escape routing of differentials pairs, the routing solutions are not good enough by previous methods. In this paper, we propose an escape routing approach of differential pairs considering length matching. The approach includes two stages. The first stage is to find min-cost median points which connect two pins by shortest and equal wire lengths while the second stage is adopted a network-flow approach with min-cost max-flow to simultaneously route all differential pairs. Experimental results show that our approach can efficiently and effectively obtain length-matching differential pairs with significant reduction in maximum and average differential-pair skews."
2173468,15237,8335,Design constraint of fine grain supply voltage control LSI,2011,"A supply voltage control technique for realizing low power LSI is utilized not only for general purpose processors, but also for custom ASIC thanks to advanced LSI design environments. Fine grain supply voltage control in time domain in power gating and DVFS scheme are seen as promising techniques to reduce power consumption. However, they require additional energy consumption for control themselves. In this paper, we discuss energy consumption including this overhead using simple circuit model and make it clear that charging energy of power supply line limits the minimum sleep duration or cycles as design constraint."
