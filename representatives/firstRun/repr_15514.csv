1450878,15514,65,"Developing skin-based technologies for interactive robots - challenges in design, development and the possible integration in therapeutic environments",2011,"Summary form only given. Scaled technologies continue to exhibit variability, driven by both random process effects and systematic structural effects. Process and design rule actions can be taken to reduce, or even eliminate, sources of systematic variability. Random variability is more difficult to combat, but architectural decisions can be made to limit the device sensitivity to specific random effects. A review of several current sources of technology variability is presented, and the impacts to the overall technology offering are assessed."
1709968,15514,65,Development of a gaze-and-touch algorithm for a tabletop Hyakunin-Isshu game with a computer opponent,2012,"We developed and demonstrated the effectiveness of Hyakunin-Eyesshu, the world's first tabletop Hyakunin-Isshu game against a computer opponent that utilizes action prediction based on gaze and hand-motion detection. In this study, we also developed the gaze-and-touch algorithm, which can realize just-found and even-match timings for use in the computer opponent's play. The just-found timing is the timing for which the computer opponent can obtain a correct card concurrently with the reaction time of the player just after the player has found the card. The even-match timing is the timing for which the computer opponent obtains the card at almost the same time as the player by predicting the player's hand reach. Finally, the authors performed an experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm and determined that various types of play can be realized through a combination of these timings."
2448528,15514,65,"Creation and Evaluation of emotion expression with body movement, sound and eye color for humanoid robots",2011,"The ability to display emotions is a key feature in human communication and also for robots that are expected to interact with humans in social environments. For expressions based on Body Movement and other signals than facial expressions, like Sound, no common grounds have been established so far. Based on psychological research on human expression of emotions and perception of emotional stimuli we created eight different expressional designs for the emotions Anger, Sadness, Fear and Joy, consisting of Body Movements, Sounds and Eye Colors. In a large pre-test we evaluated the recognition ratios for the different expressional designs. In our main experiment we separated the expressional designs into their single cues (Body Movement, Sound, Eye Color) and evaluated their expressivity. The detailed view at the perception of our expressional cues, allowed us to evaluate the appropriateness of the stimuli, check our implementations for flaws and build a basis for systematical revision. Our analysis revealed that almost all Body Movements were appropriate for their target emotion and that some of our Sounds need a revision. Eye Colors could be identified as an unreliable component for emotional expression."
1009665,15514,339,PrivateFS: a parallel oblivious file system,2012,"PrivateFS is an oblivious file system that enables access to remote storage, while keeping both the file contents and client access patterns secret. PrivateFS is based on a new parallel Oblivious RAM mechanism (PD-ORAM)---instead of waiting for the completion of all ongoing client-server transactions, client threads can now engage a server in parallel without loss of privacy.   This critical piece is missing from existing Oblivious RAMs (ORAM), which can not allow multiple clients threads to operate simultaneously without revealing intra- and inter-query correlations and thus incurring privacy leaks. And since ORAMs often require many communication rounds, this significantly and unnecessarily constrains throughput.   The mechanisms introduced here eliminate this constraint, allowing overall throughput to be bound by server bandwidth only, and thus to increase by an order of magnitude. Further, new de-amortization techniques bring the worst case query cost in line with the average cost. Both of these results are shown to be fundamental to any ORAM. Extensions providing fork consistency against an actively malicious adversary are then presented.   A high performance, fully functional PD-ORAM implementation was designed, built and analyzed. It performs multiple queries per second on a 1TB+ database across 50ms latency links, with unamortized, bound query latencies. Based on PD-ORAM, PrivateFS was built and deployed on Linux as a userspace file system."
2387217,15514,65,The function of off-gaze in human-robot interaction,2011,"When and how do users interrupt the interaction with a robot and turn to the experimenter? Usually it is assumed that experimenters affect the interaction negatively and should ideally not be present at all. However, in interaction situations with autonomous systems and inexperienced users this is often not possible for safety reasons. Thus, the participants indeed at times switch their focus of attention from the robot to the experimenter. Instead of seeing this as something purely negative, we argue that answering the questions of when, why and how this happens actually bears important information about the state of the interaction and the users' understanding of it. Therefore, we analyzed a study conducted in a home tour scenario with this respect and indeed discovered certain situations when the users turned away from the robot and towards the experimenter."
1330603,15514,65,Speaker-TTS voice mapping towards natural and characteristic robot storytelling,2013,"Robot storytelling has the potential for its practical use in various domains such as entertainment, education, and rehabilitation. However, relying on human-recorded voices for natural storytelling is costly, and automation with text-to-speech systems is not readily applicable due to the difficulty of reflecting the full nature of stories in TTS systems. In this paper, we address the problem of automating robot storytelling with a particular focus on two issues: speaker identification and speaker-TTS voice mapping. We first conduct text analysis with rich linguistic clues to identify speakers from a given textual story. We then consider the task of speaker-TTS voice mapping as the graph coloring problem and propose effective algorithms for assigning voices to speakers given a limited number of TTS voices. Finally, we perform a user experiment on validating the usefulness of our method. The results demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms baseline systems and is also more acceptable to users."
1371943,15514,65,A generative model of pause duration considering the relation between utterances before and after a pause,2013,"Utterance durations just before and after a pause have been considered to be the only factors affecting pause duration (Preboundary and Postboundary Effects). Recently, using an “XY utterance phrase” composed of two words, we discovered that the ratio of the two utterance durations before and after a pause affects pause duration (Pre-postboundary effect). However, it is not obvious whether such effects are useful for speech processing applications. In this research, we developed a generative model of pause duration based on multiple regression analysis from our experimental data (Primal Model), and derived two additional models with different parameters. Furthermore, we evaluated them, comparing them to a model whose pause duration is constant (Constant Model). The result was that the subjects' impressions, such as “natural,” “like,” and “familiar,” of the Primal Model were more positive than those of the Constant Model. Moreover, when compared with the two additional pause duration models, the Primal Model gave the best results. From these results, we discuss the validity of the Primal Model and the relationship between the parameters and the subjective evaluation."
1284045,15514,65,Optimal posture control for stability of intelligent cane robot,2012,"An intelligent cane robot (iCane) was designed for aiding the elderly who have muscle weakness on lower limbs. A commercial omni-directional wheels robot was used as an omni-directional mobile base, and an aluminum stick was installed on the base of cane robot. A Concept called “intentional direction (ITD)” was proposed for estimating the user's walking intention by analyzing the signal of a 6-axis force/torque sensor which is fixed to the handle of stick. A universal joint driven by two DC motors was designed to control the posture of the stick. As a care-nursing device, the cane robot was designed to assist the elderly in both indoor and outdoor environments. Therefore the size and weight of cane robot should be minimized. But in that case, there is high risk that the cane robot would be pushed over by the user. In this paper a constrained nonlinear multivariable algorithm was designed to optimize the stable posture of cane robot. By controlling the posture of stick, the maximums sufferable torque moment which lead to cane robot falling over can be increased. The experimental results show that the stability of cane robot can be enhanced effectively."
1472032,15514,65,Personality distortion in communication through teleoperated robots,2012,"Recent research has focused on such physical communication media as teleoperated robots, which provide a feeling of being with people in remote places. Recent invented media resemble cute animals or imaginary creatures that quickly attract attention. However, such appearances could distort tele-communications because they are different from human beings. This paper studies the effect on the speaker's personality that is transmitted through physical media by regarding appearances as a function that transmits the speaker's information. Although communication media's capability to transmit information reportedly influences conversations in many aspects, the effect of appearances remains unclear. To reveal the effect of appearance, we compared three appearances of communication media: stuffed-bear teleoperated robot, human-like teleoperated robot, and video chat. Our results show that communication media whose appearance greatly differs from that of the speaker distorts the personality perceived by interlocutors. This paper suggests that the design of the appearance of physical communication media needs to be carefully selected."
1471706,15514,65,Perception analysis of motion contributing to individuality using Kinect sensor,2012,"This paper investigates that human tend to percept of humanness and individuality to what features of human motion. We analyze from experiments based on test subjects how recognize of individuality by comparing a developed own self motion with other motion made by motion capture using Kinect sensor. The results showed except for the subjects could not perform the movement extremely distinctive, many subjects to recognize the movement of their own. In addition, the respondents also recognized with a video camera an objective of its own motion, the subjects of some of their own and do not match the image of the inside of me. It is difficult to percept humanness based on less-accurate expression of human motion."
1539147,15514,65,Towards dialogue dimensions for a robotic tutor in collaborative learning scenarios,2014,"There has been some studies in applying robots to education and recent research on socially intelligent robots show robots as partners that collaborate with people. On the other hand, serious games and interaction technologies have also proved to be important pedagogical tools, enhancing collaboration and interest in the learning process. This paper relates to the collaborative scenario in EMOTE EU FP7 project and its main goal is to develop and present the dialogue dimensions for a robotic tutor in a collaborative learning scenario grounded in human studies. Overall, seven dialogue dimensions between the teacher and students interaction were identified from data collected over 10 sessions of a collaborative serious game. Preliminary results regarding the teachers perspective of the students interaction suggest that student collaboration led to learning during the game. Besides, students seem to have learned a number of concepts as they played the game. We also present the protocol that was followed for the purposes of future data collection in human-human and human-robot interaction in similar scenarios."
1763917,15514,65,Embodied conversational agents as peer collaborators: Effects of multiplicity and modality,2013,"The goal of this study was to investigate the efficient use of role-taking embodied conversational agents in the facilitation of creative cognition during collaborative activities. Two factors were investigated through an experimental design addressing the number of conversational agents (one vs. two), and method of communication (voice vs. text). Participants engaged in a simple interpretation game with embodied conversational agents. The agents made suggestions on the quality of the participants' interpretations. We investigated how the two factors enhanced the quality and quantity of interpretations in collaborative activities. Results showed that the use of single agents and text-based interfaces enhanced the quantity of the creative interpretations, and the synergy created by the use of multiple agents along with a voice communication method enhanced the quality of creative interpretations. These results suggest that the number of agents and the method of communication are important in the effective use of embodied conversational agents as collaborating peers."
1329328,15514,65,Coordinating turn-taking and talking in multi-party conversations by controlling robot's eye-gaze,2014,"In this study, we suggest a method to coordinate turn-taking and talking in multi-party conversations by the gaze of a robot that participates on the side. Also, we use the experimental paradigm named “Cooperative Turn-taking Game in Non-verbal Situation”, which is a simplified multi-party conversation environment. We investigated whether designing eye-gazes for such robots can coordinate turn-taking and talking in multi-party conversations, and we found the robot's gaze could coordinate turn-taking and talking in multi-party conversations. Our study is expected to effectively encourage desirable talking in such multi-party conversations as collaborative learning scenes."
1916233,15514,65,Human-like variable-impedance control for life-cycle testing,2011,"The paper presents robotic approach to life-cycle testing based on advanced compliance control algorithms. This strategy has been demonstrated as meaningful testing approach considering repeatability and reproducibility. Moreover, developed testing procedures mimic human motion and ensure human-like testing conditions. That is a crucial advantage over simple testing machines or convenient industrial robots, which can not realize comparable system behavior. Application of a variable-impedance control strategy provides a feasible approach in reproducing human behavior and realizing faster life-cycle test execution."

1223461,15514,65,Control of intelligent cane robot considering usage of ordinary cane,2013,"Intelligent cane is a robot developed for assisting the elderly or handicapped people in walking. As a nursing-care device, the cane robot is designed to assist the elderly or handicapped people not only in indoor environments but also in outdoor environments. Therefore the cane robot is required to be smaller and lighter. In addition, it is preferred that the cane robot is movable in omni-directions so that it can be used in various situations. A concept called “intentional direction (ITD)” was proposed to estimate the user's walking intention by analyzing signals from a 6-axis force/torque sensor fixed to the handle of the aluminum stick. Admittance control method was applied to the motion control of the cane robot. In this paper, a new algorithm based on the usage and purpose of an ordinary cane is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the cane robot is appropriately stopped to support the elderly more effectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through the experiments."
1497375,15514,65,Emotional evaluation of bandit problems,2013,"In this paper, we discuss an approach to evaluate decisions made during a multi-armed bandit learning experiment. Usually, the results of machine learning algorithms applied on multi-armed bandit scenarios are rated in terms of earned reward and optimal decisions taken. These criteria are valuable for objective comparison in finite experiments. But learning algorithms used in real scenarios, for example in robotics, need to have instantaneous criteria to evaluate their actual decisions taken. To overcome this problem, in our approach each decision updates the Zürich model which emulates the human sense of feeling secure and aroused. Combining these two feelings results in an emotional evaluation of decision policies and could be used to model the emotional state of an intelligent agent."
1957770,15514,65,Emotional gait: Effects on humans' perception of humanoid robots,2014,"Humanoid robots have this formidable advantage to possess a body quite similar in shape to humans. This body grants them, obviously, locomotion but also a medium to express emotions without even needing a face. In this paper we propose to study the effects of emotional gaits from our biped humanoid robot on the subjects' perception of the robot (recognition rate of the emotions, reaction time, anthropomorphism, safety, likeness, etc.). We made the robot walk towards the subjects with different emotional gait patterns. We assessed positive (Happy) and negative (Sad) emotional gait patterns on 26 subjects divided in two groups (whether they were familiar with robots or not). We found that even though the recognition of the different types of patterns does not differ between groups, the reaction time does. We found that emotional gait patterns affect the perception of the robot. The implications of the current results for Human Robot Interaction (HRI) are discussed."
2389958,15514,65,Motion control of intelligent cane robot under normal and abnormal walking condition,2011,"In this study, we present an omni-directional cane robot for aiding the elderly and handicapped people walking. The motion control problem is investigated for both normal and abnormal walking conditions. In the case of the user's normal walking aided by the cane robot, a concept called “Intentional Direction (ITD)” is proposed. Guided by the online estimated ITD, we apply the admittance control method in the motion control of cane robot. The gravity compensation is also considered because the user is possible to walk on a slope. For the abnormal walking, we mainly studied the case of user's falling down. The Center of Gravity (COG) of user can be estimated from the angle of an inverted pendulum which represents human model. Fall prevention algorithm based on the relationship between user's COG and the cane is proposed. This algorithm is also applied in the motion control of cane robot. The proposed method are verified through experiments."
1985730,15514,65,Investigating the effects of visual saliency on deictic gesture production by a humanoid robot,2011,"In many collocated human-robot interaction scenarios, robots are required to accurately and unambiguously indicate an object or point of interest in the environment. Realistic, cluttered environments containing many visually salient targets can present a challenge for the observer of such pointing behavior. In this paper, we describe an experiment and results detailing the effects of visual saliency and pointing modality on human perceptual accuracy of a robot's deictic gestures (head and arm pointing) and compare the results to the perception of human pointing."

This construction fills in the gap between the two existing constructions for purely additive spanners, one for 2-additive spanner of size O(n3/2) and the other for 6-additive spanner of size O(n4/3), and thus answers a main open question in this area. In addition, we present a construction for additive spanners with O(n1+δ) edges and additive stretch of O(n1/2−3δ/2) for any 3/17 ≤ δ < 1/3, improving the stretch of the existing constructions from O(n1−3δ) to O(√n1−3δ). Finally, we show that our (1,n1/2−3δ/2)-spanner construction can be tweaked to give a sublinear additive spanner of size O(n1+3/17) with additive stretch O(√distance)."

Unlike the case that the two numbers are same (n = m), index coding problems with n ≤ m are more general and hard to handle. To circumvent this difficulty, problems with n<m are approached via corresponding problems with n = m.

Such cases include cases with n<m ≤ 5."

Previously, Guruswami et al. [1] showed that it is quasi-NP-hard to color 2-colorable 8-uniform hypergraphs with 22 O(vlog log n) colors. Their result is obtained by composing a standard Outer PCP with an Inner PCP based on the Short Code of super-constant degree. Our result is instead obtained by composing a new Outer PCP with an Inner PCP based on the Short Code of degree two."

Although quadrupedal bound gait models have been investigated, there is no research which shows the generation of limit cycle and its dynamic properties. In the present study, we analyze a quadrupedal bound gait model which goes down slope and has back and front bodies with spring-damper joint between the bodies. We found the periodic bound gait which achieves a stable limit cycle and convergence property against perturbations."

We describe an algorithm that solves the replacement paths problem for directed graphs embedded on a surface of any genus  g  in  O ( gn  log  n ) time, generalizing a recent  O ( n  log  n )-time algorithm of Wulff-Nilsen for planar graphs [SODA 2010]."

Our novel setting includes an option to sell each good for a fraction of the minimum value any player has for the good. To rigorously quantify the efficiency gain from selling, we reason about the price of envy-freeness of allocations of sellable goods--the ratio between the maximum social welfare and the social welfare of the best envy-free allocation. We show that envy-free allocations of sellable goods are significantly more efficient than their unsellable counterparts."

We develop algorithms for the synthesis of stable grasps with low friction sensitivity and for the synthesis of stable grasps in the case of small friction coefficients. We describe how grasps with low friction sensitivity can be used when a robot has an uncertain belief about friction coefficients and study the statistics of grasp quality under changes in those coefficients. We also provide a parametric estimate for the distribution of grasp qualities and friction sensitivities for a uniformly sampled set of grasps.

Samuel Karlin conjectured in 1959 that fictitious play converges at rate O(t -- 1/2) with respect to the number of steps t. We disprove this conjecture by showing that, when the payoff matrix of the row player is the n × n identity matrix, fictitious play may converge (for some tie-breaking) at rate as slow as a#x3A9;(t -- 1/n)."

Motion planning is carried out by the human-in-the-loop to grasp and manipulate an object using viscoelastic soft fingertips. In addition, to grasp an object firmly, an estimated torque is synthesized based on fuzzy inference. Experimental results show that the user confidence presents small variations using soft fingertips. Then, the soft fingertips in pHRI induce a more user dexterity than rigid fingertips."

Our analysis reveals that acknowledgments has a very low potential in LT codes with standard degree distributions. Motivated by this, we analyze the impact of acknowledgments on multi-layer LT codes. In this case, feedback proves advantageous. By using only a single feedback message, it is possible to achieve a significant performance improvement compared to traditional LT codes."

A suitable dynamic model that considers the coupling between the manipulator and flexible appendage was developed for the controller to accomplish the vibration suppression control of the flexible appendage. The flexible appendage was modeled using a virtual joint model, and the control method was developed on the basis of this model. Although this type of control requires feedback of the flexible appendage state, its direct measurement is generally difficult. Thus, an estimator of the flexible appendage state was constructed using a force/torque sensor attached between the base and flexible appendage. The control method was experimentally verified using an air-floating system."

While the question is still open for the general case, we show that it is related to the edge removal problem, which has been studied recently."

1210714,15514,23735,Development of a walking support robot with velocity-based mechanical safety devices,2013,"Safety is one of the most important issues in walking support robots. This paper presents a walking support robot equipped with velocity-based mechanical safety devices. The safety devices consist of only mechanical components without actuators, controllers, or batteries. The safety device is attached to each drive-shaft of the robot. If the safety device detects an unexpected angular velocity of the drive-shaft, the safety device can switch off all motors of the robot and lock the drive-shaft. The safety devices can work even if the robot's controller does not work. Firstly, we describe the characteristics of the safety device. Secondly, we explain the walking support robot and the structure and mechanism of the safety device. Thirdly, we show the walking support robot which we developed. Finally, we experimentally verify the effectiveness of the safety device."

The query time can be further reduced to O((α + μ)t) at the expense of a small additive stretch."

At the heart of this process is a prediction task, the spectrum identification problem, in which each fragmentation spectrum produced by a shotgun proteomics experiment must be mapped to the peptide (protein subsequence) which generated the spectrum. We propose a new algorithm for spectrum identification, based on dynamic Bayesian networks, which significantly outperforms the de-facto standard tools for this task: SEQUEST and Mascot."

172032,15514,21106,A supremum norm based near neighbor search in high dimensional spaces,2012,This paper presents a new near neighbor search. Feature vectors to be stored do not have to be of equal length. Two feature vectors are getting compared with respect to supremum norm. Time demand to learn a new feature vector does not depend on the number of vectors already learned. A query is formulated not as a single feature vector but as a set of features which overcomes the problem of possible permutation of components in a representation vector. Components of a learned feature vector can be cut out - the algorithm is still capable to recognize the remaining part.

Recent experiments suggest that in practice, a naive linking method works just as well if not better than linking by rank, in spite of being theoretically inferior. How can this be? We prove that randomized linking is asymptotically as efficient as linking by rank. This result provides theory that matches the experiments, which implicitly do randomized linking as a result of the way the input instances are generated."
2556220,15514,22113,Towards a model-centric cognitive architecture for service robots,2011,The development of service robots has gained more and more attention over the last years. Advanced robots have to cope with many different situations and contingencies while executing concurrent and interruptable complex tasks. To manage the sheer variety of different execution variants the robot has to decide at run-time for the most appropriate behavior to execute. That requires task coordination mechanisms that provide the flexibility to adapt at run-time and allow to balance between alternatives.

The motion planning is used intraoperatively at each cycle to compensate for system uncertainties and perturbations. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed motion planner on a workspace based on ultrasound images.

Our formalism also shows how to exploit the error-correcting capacity of component codes to design good GCQCs efficiently."

A steepest descent path on a polyhedral terrain  T  with  n  vertices can have θ( n  2 ) complexity. The watershed of a point  p ---the set of points on  T  whose paths of steepest descent reach  p ---can have complexity θ( n  3 ). We present a technique for tracing a collection of  n  paths of steepest descent on  T  implicitly in  O ( n  log  n ) time. We then derive  O ( n  log  n ) time algorithms for: (i) computing for each local minimum  p  of  T  the triangles contained in the watershed of  p  and (ii) computing the surface network graph of  T .   We also present an  O ( n  2 ) time algorithm that computes the watershed area for each local minimum of  T .

2483564,15514,23735,Passive collision force suppression mechanism for robot manipulator,2013,"This paper presents a robot manipulator with collision force suppression mechanism that can passively suppress collision force. The collision suppression mechanism consists of a release air pad, a transmission rack, a clutch gear and a compression spring. An air cushion bag is attached to the exterior of the robot manipulator. If a robot manipulator collides with an object or human when a task is performed, the collision force suppression mechanism disjoints the specific joint corresponding to the direction of the collision force to reduce the collision force. The robot manipulator will then return to the former task when the colliding object is eliminated. Through collision experiments, the effectiveness of the collision force suppression mechanism is verified."

We show how to construct an implicit function φ: Rd → Rd--m from P so that the zero-set Sφ of φ contains a homeomorphic approximation of Σ. The Hausdorff distance between Σ and this homeomorphic approximation is at most eτ for any fixed τ < 2. Moreover, for every point x at distance eτ or less from Σ, the normal space of Sφ at x makes an O(e(τ-1)/2) angle with the normal space of Σ at the point nearest to x. The function φ has local support, which makes local homeomorphic reconstruction possible without a complete sampling."

1470430,15514,65,The effect of color and shape on aesthetic evaluation of colored shape,2013,"When we perceive a colored shape, how the aesthetic evaluation is affected by the color or the shape. This study investigates the effect of color and shape on the aesthetic evaluation of colored shape. We used 16 shapes and 12 colors. 16 shapes were varied the magnitude of shape parameters that correspond to the three dimensions of curvedness, regularity, and complexity. 12 colors were selected from Munsell color system. In the experiment, different two groups of participants were assigned the task of rating 8 shapes, 6 colors, and 48 colored shapes on three scales with seven-points, according to the semantic differential method. These scales were constructed of three adjectives regarding the aesthetic evaluation, which are like-unlike, pleasant-unpleasant, and beautiful-ugly. First, we examined the one factor structure, which is the aesthetic evaluation, by the factor analysis. Next, the multiple regression analysis was used to predict that of colored shape from the aesthetic evaluation of color and shape which had been obtained separately. This prediction was successful as indicated by high R 2  values to multiple correlation coefficient. The analysis indicated that the aesthetic evaluation of colored shape was influenced on both of the color and shape component, however, the shape component had stronger influnce on that of the colored shape than the color component. The analysis for each scale; beauty, pleasantness, and liking also showed the similar results. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of color and shape on the aesthetic evaluation of colored shape considering shape psychophysical features. As the results, in the case of regular shape stimulus set, the effect of color component was higher than that of shape component."
2383900,15514,65,Reinforcement learning from human reward: Discounting in episodic tasks,2012,"Several studies have demonstrated that teaching agents by human-generated reward can be a powerful technique. However, the algorithmic space for learning from human reward has hitherto not been explored systematically. Using model-based reinforcement learning from human reward in goal-based, episodic tasks, we investigate how anticipated future rewards should be discounted to create behavior that performs well on the task that the human trainer intends to teach. We identify a “positive circuits” problem with low discounting (i.e., high discount factors) that arises from an observed bias among humans towards giving positive reward. Empirical analyses indicate that high discounting (i.e., low discount factors) of human reward is necessary in goal-based, episodic tasks and lend credence to the existence of the positive circuits problem."
2425804,15514,65,A considerate care robot able to serve in multi-party settings,2011,"This paper introduces a service robot that provides assisted-care, such as serving tea to the elderly in care facilities. In multi-party settings, a robot is required to be able to deal with requests from multiple individuals simultaneously. In particular, when the service robot is concentrating on taking care of a specific person, other people who want to initiate interaction may feel frustrated with the robot. To a considerable extent this may be caused by the robot's behavior, which does not indicate any response to subsequent requests while preoccupied with the first. Therefore, we developed a robot that can project the order of service in a socially acceptable manner to each person who wishes to initiate interaction. In this paper we focus on the task of tea-serving, and introduce a robot able to bring tea to multiple users while accepting multiple requests. The robot can detect a person raising their hand to make a request, and move around people using its mobile functions while avoiding obstacles. When the robot detects a person's request while already serving tea to another person, it projects that it has received the order by indicating “you are next” through a nonverbal action, such as turning its gaze to the person. Because it can project the order of service and indicate its acknowledgement of their requests socially, people will likely feel more satisfied with the robot even when it cannot immediately address their needs. We confirmed the effectiveness of this capability through an experiment in which the robot distributed snacks to participants."
2242803,15514,65,Modeling humans as observation providers using POMDPs,2011,"The ability to obtain accurate observations while navigating in uncertain environments is a difficult challenge in deploying robots. Robots have relied heavily on human supervisors who are always available to provide additional observations to reduce uncertainty. We are instead interested in taking advantage of humans who are already in the environment to receive observations. The challenge is in modeling these humans' availability and higher costs of interruption to determine when to query them during navigation. In this work, we introduce a Human Observation Provider POMDP framework (HOP-POMDP), and contribute new algorithms for planning and executing with HOP-POMDPs that account for the differences between humans and other probabilistic sensors that provide observations. We compare optimal HOP-POMDP policies that plan for needing humans' observations with oracle POMDP policies that do not take human costs and availability into account. We show in benchmark tests and real-world environments that the oracle policies match the optimal HOP-POMDP policy 60% of the time, and can be used in cases when humans are likely to be available on the shortest paths. However, the HOP-POMDP policies receive higher rewards in general as they take into account the possibility that a human may be unavailable. HOP-POMDP policies only need to be computed once prior to the deployment of the robot, so it is feasible to precompute and use in practice."
1740731,15514,65,Path-finding using reinforcement learning and affective states,2014,"During decision making and acting in the environment humans appraise decisions and observations with feelings and emotions. In this paper we propose a framework to incorporate an emotional model into the decision making process of a machine learning agent. We use a hierarchical structure to combine reinforcement learning with a dimensional emotional model. The dimensional model calculates two dimensions representing the actual affective state of the autonomous agent. For the evaluation of this combination, we use a reinforcement learning experiment (called Dyna Maze) in which, the agent has to find an optimal path through a maze. Our first results show that the agent is able to appraise the situation in terms of emotions and react according to them."
1130920,15514,65,"Mutual gaze, personality, and familiarity: Dual eye-tracking during conversation",2012,"Mutual gaze is an important aspect of face-to-face communication that arises from the interaction of the gaze behavior of two individuals. In this dual eye-tracking study, gaze data was collected from human conversational pairs with the goal of gaining insight into what characteristics of the conversation partners influence this behavior. We investigate the link between personality, familiarity and mutual gaze. The results found indicate that mutual gaze behavior depends on the characteristics of both partners rather than on either individual considered in isolation. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of socially appropriate gaze controllers for robots that interact with people."
1505220,15514,65,A ROS-integrated architecture to learn manipulation tasks from a single demonstration,2014,"In the robot programming by demonstration (PbD) framework, the high-level representation of a skill in a series of action units gives an intuitive method to program and instruct robot behaviors. In this context we present a ROS (Robot Operating System) integrated architecture for learning households manipulation tasks by one observation. The user is observed during the execution of everyday tasks, every action is analyzed and its effect is translated into changes in the environment state. During the observation a strip-like map of the task is built and stored as a sequence of actions. From the map obtained the task can be performed. A planner robustly adapts the execution both to different environment initial conditions and to possible faults, occurring during the operations. We test the capability of the chosen approach to autonomously learn and robustly perform complex tasks, such as setting up and clearing a table in a real kitchen-like environment."
1411726,15514,65,Providing robots with problem awareness skills,2012,"Humanoid robots operating in the real world must exhibit very complex behaviors, such as object manipulation or interaction with people. Such capabilities pose the problem of being able to reason on a huge number of different objects, places and actions to carry out, each one relevant for achieving robot goals. This article proposes a functional representation of objects, places and actions described in terms of affordances and capabilities. Everyday problems can be efficiently dealt with by decomposing the reasoning process in two phases, namely problem awareness (which is the focus of this article) and action selection."
2223349,15514,65,Automatic detection of stereotyped hand flapping movements: Two different approaches,2012,"Stereotypical motor movements are one of the most common and least understood behaviors occurring in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The traditional methods for recording the number of occurrences and duration of stereotypies are insufficient and time consuming. Thus the objective of this study is to automatically detect stereotypical motor movements in real time considering two different approaches. The first approach uses the Microsoft sensor Kinect and gesture recognition algorithms. The second approach uses a trademark device of Texas Instruments with built-in accelerometers and statistical methods to recognize stereotyped movements. The two proposed systems were tested in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and the results are compared. This study provides a valuable tool to monitor stereotypes in order to understand and to cope with this problematic. In the end, it facilitates the identification of relevant behavioral patterns when studying interaction skills in children with ASD."
1405624,15514,23735,Multimodal control for human-robot cooperation,2013,"For intuitive human-robot collaboration, the robot must quickly adapt to the human behavior. To this end, we propose a multimodal sensor-based control framework, enabling a robot to recognize human intention, and consequently adapt its control strategy. Our approach is marker-less, relies on a Kinect and on an on-board camera, and is based on a unified task formalism. Moreover, we validate it in a mock-up industrial scenario, where human and robot must collaborate to insert screws in a flank."
2041762,15514,23735,Card manipulation using a high-speed robot system with high-speed visual feedback,2012,"In this research, we successfully demonstrated dexterous manipulation of sheet-like elastic objects, namely, playing cards, using a high-speed robot system. In particular, our goal was to achieve card flicking by vibrating a fingertip of a robot hand at high speed and card catching by using high-speed visual feedback based on a high-speed vision system. We discuss card grasping in the initial state based on the geometry conditions of the card and the kinematics of the robot hand, and we propose a strategy for card flicking. We also suggest a card catching method based on information obtained by the high-speed vision system. In addition, we obtain the card flicking conditions by analyzing the slip between the card and the fingertip of the robot hand. Finally, we show experimental results of card flicking and card catching."
790110,15514,65,Bayesian filtering for localization using decoupled visual measurements,2013,"In this paper, we present a particle-filter-based localization framework with decoupled visual measurements (image features) for process and measurement models. Thus our approach enables using camera-based motion estimation while achieving the independence between the process noise and the measurement noise in the Bayesian filtering framework. In addition, we alternately perform sequential and global localization on the basis of the marginal likelihood in order to avoid severe errors caused by incorrect data association."
2536121,15514,22021,On irreducible polynomial remainder codes,2011,"A general class of polynomial remainder codes is considered. These codes are very flexible in rate and length and include Reed-Solomon codes as a special case. In general, the code symbols of such codes are polynomials of different degree, which leads to two different notions of weights and of distances. The notion of an error locator polynomial is generalized to such codes. A key equation is proposed, from which the error locator polynomial can be computed by means of a gcd algorithm. From the error locator polynomial, the transmitted message can be recovered in two different ways, which may be new even when specialized to Reed-Solomon codes."

Scaffold-based locomotion of a snake-like robot using decentralized control,2013,"Snakes are able to move effectively by using terrain irregularities as scaffolds against which they push their bodies. This locomotion is attractive from a robotic viewpoint because irregularities in the environment of conventional robots interfere with their operation. In a previous work, we proposed a decentralized control mechanism of the scaffold-based locomotion of snakes, which combined curvature derivative control with local pressure reflex. Here, we practically demonstrate how a snake-like robot utilizing the proposed control scheme moves effectively by pushing its body against pegs."

A new vehicle-road evaluation algorithm is developed based on this model, and new path tracking controller is designed. The difficulties of preview distance selection and parameters tuning with speed of pure following controller are avoided in this controller. Performance of the novel method is verified by simulation and vehicle experiments."
2702571,15514,20332,How to cut a cake before the party ends,2013,"For decades researchers have struggled with the problem of envy-free cake cutting: how to divide a divisible good between multiple agents so that each agent likes his own allocation best. Although an envy-free cake cutting protocol was ultimately devised, it is unbounded, in the sense that the number of operations can be arbitrarily large, depending on the preferences of the agents. We ask whether bounded protocols exist when the agents' preferences are restricted. Our main result is an envy-free cake cutting protocol for agents with piecewise linear valuations, which requires a number of operations that is polynomial in natural parameters of the given instance."

We obtain an almost tight upper bound of O(n 2+e ), for any e > 0, on the maximum number of discrete changes that the Delaunay triangulation DT(P) of P experiences during this motion. Our analysis is cast in a purely topological setting, where we only assume that (i) any four points can be co-circular at most three times, and (ii) no triple of points can be collinear more than twice; these assumptions hold for unit speed motions."
1005478,15514,23735,Creation of radiated sound intensity maps using multi-modal measurements onboard an autonomous mobile platform,2013,"This paper presents a method for mapping the radiated sound intensity of an environment using an autonomous mobile platform. The sound intensities radiated by the objects are estimated by combining the sound intensity at the platform's position (estimated with a steered response power algorithm) and the distances to the objects (estimated using laser range finders). By combining the estimated sound intensity at the platform's position with the platform's pose obtained from a particle filter based localization algorithm, the sound intensity radiated from the objects is registered in the cells of a grid map covering the environment. This procedure creates a map of the radiated sound intensity that contains information about the sound directivity. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a map of radiated sound intensity is created for a test environment. Then the position and the directivity of the sound sources in the test environment are estimated from this map."
1127999,15514,65,How do verbal/bodily fillers ease embarrassing situations during silences in conversations?,2014,"In this study we analyzed the roles of verbal/bodily fillers for recovering from awkward silences in conversations. We focused on verbal fillers such as “ummm” and “uh,” and bodily fillers like “touching own hair or chin” that commonly emerge during silences between turns in conversations. We designed and created simulated dyadic-conversation scenarios using computer graphics characters, and then performed evaluations utilizing stimuli drawn from these simulations. Subjective evaluation results suggested that fillers express participants' sincerity in maintaining conversations and they can be used as clues for other participants to begin their utterances. These findings have practical implications for the behavioral design of conversational robots that can behave more appropriately and politely with humans."
1290808,15514,65,How can a robot signal its incapability to perform a certain task to humans in an acceptable manner,2014,"In this paper, a robot that is using politeness to overcome its incapability to serve is presented. The mobile robot “Alex” is interacting with human office colleagues in their environment and delivers messages, phone calls, and companionship. The robot's battery capacity is not sufficient to survive a full working day. Thus, the robot needs to recharge during the day. By doing so it is unavailable for tasks that involve movement. The study presented in this paper supports the idea that an incapability of fullfiling an appointed task can be overcome by politeness and showing appropriate behaviour. The results, reveal that, even the simple adjustment of spoken utterances towards a more polite phrasing can change the human's perception of the robot companion. This change in the perception can be made visible by analysing the human's behaviour towards the robot."
1280076,15514,65,BReA: Potentials of combining reality and virtual communications using a blended reality agent,2013,"This paper proposes a blended reality agent, called BReA, whose body presents and transfers itself between real and virtual environments. BReA can communicate with people through not only real-world communication but also virtual communication. Recent research studies have shown the merits and demerits of communication with robotic agents under a real-world environment, and on-screen agents in a virtual world. BReA, whose body can be located in both real and virtual worlds, possesses the merits of both robotic and on-screen agents. In addition, the feature through which BReA communicates with people in real and virtual environments allows users to acknowledge real-world objects based on its references from a virtual environment. We conducted a field test in a supermarket to confirm whether customers can engage themselves in communication with BReA. An analysis of the consumer reactions confirmed that customers definitely recognized that the directions of the pointing gestures performed by BReA in a virtual environment were oriented outside of the display. Moreover, we observed some customers approaching closer to BReA as it transferred from a real environment into a virtual world. These results demonstrated that BReA succeeds in immersing customers in its presentation."
1087409,15514,65,Evaluating in real life robotic environment: Bringing together research and practice,2012,"In this paper we report about a methodological approach to cooperatively evaluate the usability of two different teach pendants for teaching a robotic arm. Two case studies were conducted to compare an already established teach pendant with a novel prototype which applies a different interaction paradigm. Involved in these studies were the company which produces the teach pendant (our industrial partner) and two clients of this company (one in the automotive sector, the other one in the injection modeling sector). We describe the cooperation in this project in detail, how the industrial partners were involved, and our approach to enhance the integration of usability studies in the life cycle of their industrial robotic products. Upon conducting these case studies in the industrial context we come to understand bit by bit the interplay of industrial robots in a better way and how we could affect user centered design (UCD) of real life robotic products with our work."

Law is not already prepared for the aspects coming with this new technology. This regards not only to research and development but also to application and use of this systems. Some legal areas like liability or admission are already debated at the moment. In this paper other crucial problems like privacy or legal status will be discussed. Issues of privacy regarding legal sources, basic principles and privacy in research and development will be focused on. Moreover, the use and application of robots will be analyzed. Additionally it concentrates on the status of robots and electronic personhood. Actions of software agents will be evaluated legally and the concept of electronic personhood will be introduced."
1500247,15514,65,"People help robots who help others, not robots who help themselves",2014,"Robots that engage in social behaviors benefit greatly from possessing tools that allow them to manipulate the course of an interaction. Using a non-anthropomorphic social robot and a simple counting game, we examine the effects that empathy-generating robot dialogue has on participant performance across three conditions. In the self-directed condition, the robot petitions the participant to reduce his or her performance so that the robot can avoid punishment. In the externally-directed condition, the robot petitions on behalf of its programmer so that its programmer can avoid punishment. The control condition does not involve any petitions for empathy. We find that externally-directed petitions from the robot show a higher likelihood of motivating the participant to sacrifice his or her own performance to help, at the expense of incurring negative social effects. We also find that experiencing these emotional dialogue events can have complex and difficult to predict effects, driving some participants to antipathy, leaving some unaffected, and manipulating others into feeling empathy towards the robot."
752335,15514,65,Quantification of concern for others to social skill evaluation,2013,"This paper addresses a quantification technique of cooperative characteristics on Concern For Others: CFO in a cooperative work by multiple operators. The cooperative works are generally required suitable cooperation to accomplish the task adequately. Although the “cooperation” is one of keywords for social psychological field, few study has been investigated for engineering application, that is, quantification of the cooperative characteristics is not focused on. Thus, most of researches on human-machine systems have been considered to assist a single operator. In that case, human intention concentrates upon only faced robot operation. Measured input command by the operator includes all of operator's intention. However, in cooperative works, measured input probably contains the effect from other operators, that is CFO. A challenge of this study is to quantify the cooperative characteristics as the CFO in cooperative tasks. Then CFO utilizes to realize a novel assist system to enhance their cooperation. To obtain CFO in such tasks, the human input pattern during a solo work was learned by human model before the cooperative task. Then, the difference between measured input command in cooperative work and the predicted command in the human model is defined as the CFO. Finally, this paper addresses the correlation analysis between the CFO and cooperative task performance."
1748628,15514,65,Intermediary assist for Cooperative Works: Quantification technique of Concern for Others,2012,"This paper addresses a quantification technique of cooperative characteristics focusing on Concern For Others: CFO in a cooperative work by multiple participants. The CFO is utilized for objective evaluation of human altruism. We have two goals of this research are to realize a mediate assist system for cooperative tasks and to develop a training tool of social skill for persons with autism. Most of studies on human-machine systems have been considered to assist a single operator. Here, we focused on a cooperative task by multiple participants. In this case, the command input of each operator includes CFO to achieve suitable cooperation. The CFO, however, may bring about misreading of the player's intention to give a suitable assist for the system. Thus the COF is expected to work as a filter to obtain operators characteristics accurately in such tasks. On the other hands, if the CFO can be obtained by the system, a new assist scheme to help their cooperation as a mediator will be invented. As a first step of such assist systems, a cooperative work platform employing haptic interface without force sensors is developed. The cooperative task is very simple and intuitive as controlling a ball on the plate whose edges are held by multiple humans. To obtain CFO in this task, the human input pattern during a solo work was learned by CMAC before the cooperative task. Then, the difference between an input command in cooperative work and the predicted command in the solo one is defined as the CFO. Finally, this paper addresses the technique to obtain CFO and the applications with it is discussed."
1155716,15514,65,Early processes of social attention elicited by a humanoid robot,2013,"Autism is a lifelong pervasive disorder of social cognition associated in particular with difficulties in joint attention, ie sharing the focus of attention to an object of the world with another agent. Care strategies that are expected to use artificial agents to support the intensive early intervention program to rehabilitate key aspects of normal cognition in autism already focus on joint attention. Yet little is known on how early social attentional processes are impacted the use of humanoid robots in comparison to real humans. Here, we used of social version of Posner's spatial orienting task, developed to investigate how exogenous stimuli bias attention in space, to see whether human and robot upper torso posture presented centrally have similar effects on the orientation of attention to the side. In this experiment, participants respond to the appearance of a target on the left or right of the computer screen. Prior to the target, a spatial cue, in our case the human or robot torso looking left or right, is used to orient attention of the participant. Reaction time was significantly increased when a robot was used instead of a human spatial cue, suggesting it was harder to disengage attention from the robot than the human. We reproduced the congruency effect, with reduced reaction time when the spatial cue point to the side where the target later appears, with no interaction with the agent used as cue. While further work is required to clarify why our present results conflict with the existing literature with regards to human stimuli, they clearly support that a humanoid robot upper torso is at least as capable as a human stimulus to elicit the early orientation of attention investigated by the social version of Posner's task."
895071,15514,65,Bio-inspired compliant spine for humanoid robot a degrees of freedom challenge,2012,"Taking into consideration the architecture of the human spine, we propose the construction of a module whose series could be used as a robotic spine*. This module is basically constituted by an elastic diabolo, which mimics the vertebral bodies and the intervertebral disc, joining two metallic setsquares — the two consecutive vertebrae. Two actuators realize the actuation of the module and are oriented parallel to the main axis of the diabolo. This simple compliant model allowed us to construct a demonstrator that will be used to measure the incidence of active and passive movements of the model. From the knowledge of these results we will design a new compliant system in place of the elastic diabolo whose characteristics will be adequate to the convenient properties of the spine that could be included in humanoid machines."
1589116,15514,65,Teaching data characteristics for direct teaching using a robot with a dual-shell structure,2012,"In this paper, a robot with a dual-shell structure is proposed to improve operability using direct teaching. The dual-shell structure separates the robot arm actuator from the gripper for the operator. Hence, during the teaching process, the robot arm is able to track the motion of the operator and the operability within the arm's movable range can be improved. Furthermore, by inserting an elastic body into the robot's dual-shell structure, operation with an adequate viscosity for the operator can be achieved. To assess the effectiveness of this structure, an evaluation system is constructed based on a dual-shell structure robot with an elastic body inserted, for the skilled task of inserting flexible printed circuits. In the evaluation experiments, it was found that the teaching time is approximately 1500 msec shorter with the elastic body, and no matter which teaching data is used, the flexible printed circuit is inserted successfully."
1707957,15514,65,A method for altering vibrotactile textures based on specified materials,2012,"A vibrotactile texture display produces virtual textures by applying vibratory stimuli to finger pads. In this study, we developed a technique to alter such textures based on certain specified materials. For example, the technique allows us to alter vibrotactile textures using terms such as “wood-,” “cotton-,” or “paper-like” which are familiar to end users of displays. The altered textures feel more similar to these specified materials. We realized this technique by constructing a material space, in which the materials are located based on the features of their vibrotactile spectra. The vibrotactile textures were then modified in this space. Our experimental results show that the technique can be used to alter a virtual wood texture to feel like cloth."
1343413,15514,65,Elastic networks in reshaping human intentions by proactive social robot moves,2014,"This paper focuses on reshaping a previously detected human intention into a desired one, using contextual motions of mobile robots, which are in our applications, autonomous mobile 2-steps stairs and a chair. Our system first estimates the current intention based on human heading and trajectory depicted as orientation and location. Our previous reshaping applications have shown that the current human intention has to be deviated towards the new desired one in phases. In our novel approach, Elastic network generates way points of trajectories each of which acts as transient trajectories directed towards the desired intention's location. Our methodology aims at generating an “intention trajectory” towards the final goal. The initial way points possess destabilizing effects on the obstinance of the person intention making the “robot gain the curiosity and the trust of the person”. Each way point generated by the elastic network is executed by moves of an adequate robot (here mobile 2-steps or chair) in adequate directions (towards coffee table, PC, TV, library). After each robot moves, the resulting human intention is estimated and compared to the desired goal in the intention space. Intention trajectories are searched in two modes: the “confident mode” and the “suspicious mode” which are defining human body-mood detected relying on proxemics. This paper analyzes our novel approach of planning trajectories via elastic networks based on these two modes."
1920737,15514,65,Challenges to decoding the intention behind natural instruction,2011,"Currently, most systems for human-robot teaching allow only one mode of teacher-student interaction (e.g., teaching by demonstration or feedback), and teaching episodes have to be carefully set-up by an expert. To understand how we might integrate multiple, interleaved forms of human instruction into a robot learner, we performed a behavioral study in which 44 untrained humans were allowed to freely mix interaction modes to teach a simulated robot (secretly controlled by a human) a complex task. Analysis of transcripts showed that human teachers often give instructions that are nontrivial to interpret and not easily translated into a form useable by machine learning algorithms. In particular, humans often use implicit instructions, fail to clearly indicate the boundaries of procedures, and tightly interleave testing, feedback, and new instruction. In this paper, we detail these teaching patterns and discuss the challenges they pose to automatic teaching interpretation as well as the machine-learning algorithms that must ultimately process these instructions. We highlight the challenges by demonstrating the difficulties of an initial automatic teacher interpretation system."
1191421,15514,65,Isolation of physical traits and conversational content for personality design,2012,"In this paper, we propose the “Doppel teleoperation system,” which isolates several physical traits from a speaker, to investigate how personal information is conveyed to others during conversation. An underlying problem on designing personality in social robots is that it remains unclear how humans judge the personalities of conversation partners. With the Doppel system, for each of the communication channels to be transferred, one can choose it in its original form or in the one generated by the system. For example, voice and body motions can be replaced by the Doppel system while preserving the speech content. This allows us to analyze the individual effects of the physical traits of the speaker and the content in the speaker's speech on the identification of personality. This selectivity of personal traits provides a useful approach to investigate which information conveys our personality through conversation. To show the potential of our system, we experimentally tested how much the conversation content conveys the personality of speakers to interlocutors without any of their physical traits. Preliminary results show that although interlocutors have difficulty identifying speakers only using conversational contents, they can recognize their acquaintances when their acquaintances are the speakers. We point out some potential physical traits to convey personality."
1438104,15514,65,Personal identity module using psychoevolutionary emotion theory for social robots,2012,"Robots that interacts socially in human being environment should be able to understand and act over it using clues from humans; it includes all types of expression: facial, non-facial, verbal and nonverbal affective expressions. These behaviors need a model capable to compute external and internal information to construct autonomous robots. In this paper, we are proposing a basis for modeling some reflexes inherent to human beings that are responsible by personal identity of each individual. The proposed model is constituted by two reflex modules and an emotion module that are based on psychoevolutionary theory. Then, this model has been inserted in our social architecture as an improvement of old motivational module and evaluated in a simulator. The advantage of the proposed approach from others is the possibility of representing the emotion as an internal function which varies over the time with different types of interaction. The experimental results show that this module is capable to emulate adequately human beings basic reflex in a robot during a simple interaction with a caregiver."
1230398,15514,65,Graded cueing feedback in robot-mediated imitation practice for children with autism spectrum disorders,2014,"We performed a study that examined the effects of a humanoid robot giving the minimum required feedback - graded cueing - during a one-on-one imitation game played children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). 12 high-functioning participants with ASD, ages 7 to 10, each played “Copy-Cat” with a Nao robot 5 times over the span of 2.5 weeks. While the graded cueing model was not exercised in its fullest, using graded cueing-style feedback resulted in a nondecreasing trend in imitative accuracy when compared to a non-adaptive condition, where participants always received the same, most descriptive feedback whenever they made a mistake. These trends show promise for future work with robots encouraging autonomy in special needs populations."
937260,15514,65,Development of vibrotactile cradle for smart cell-phone providing spatial and directional cues,2012,"In this paper, we applied famous sensory illusions to generate spatial and directional vibrotactile cues using a vibrotactile cradle for the smart cell-phone. A grooved and slim design is applied to the contact side of the cradle for comfortable gripping, and the contact part consists of twelve vibrotactile areas which can operate independently. To maintain isolation among vibrotactile actuators, the surface of the cover is specially designed to absorb propagating vibration over the surface. The cradle's backside consists of twelve linear resonant actuators, a soft covering intersections and supporting area for actuators. For an evaluation of the developed device, two experiments were conducted to test whether directional information and spatial information according to visual data can be successfully displayed by the developed device. As a result, spatial and directional information is useful for displaying intuitive information for smart cell-phone application with the cradle."
1329705,15514,65,Illustrative evaluation index for haptic interfaces using confusion matrices,2012,"For researchers of haptic interfaces, evaluation of the perceptual similarity between virtual and real haptic stimuli has long been a serious problem. One of the most commonly employed evaluation methods is an identification task where assessors identify the type of randomly presented stimuli among multiple candidates. The results of this method are summarized as confusion matrices. We developed a method that allocates all virtual and real stimuli in a perceptual space. The spatial distribution of the stimuli allows us to visually understand the perceptual relationships between the stimuli. A brief validation confirmed that the proposed method is effective in evaluating the perceptual similarity between virtual and real stimuli."
1431459,15514,208,Low Expected Latency Routing in Dynamic Networks,2014,"Timely and efficient message transmission through intermittently and sparsely connected networks is a problem of significant interest to the mobile networking community. Although the long-term statistics describing the time-varying connectivity in such networks can be characterized systematically and can be used for selecting good routes, it may be possible to achieve better performance by intelligently using the actual link states at the time of routing, in conjunction with these statistical dynamics models. In this paper, we investigate a family of minimum expected latency routing methods for such dynamic networks, spanning purely model-based and state-oblivious source routing, state-based source routing, and various flavors of dynamic (or hop-by-hop) routing, with increasing amounts of current link state knowledge around the source. First, we give a heuristic and an approximation scheme for the model-assisted source routing problem, as well as heuristics for the dynamic routing problem. Then we show using extensive simulations on both synthetic and real time-varying connectivity traces that although dynamically sampling link states helps to improve expected routing latency compared to source routing, the marginal improvements decline rapidly for knowledge of current link states beyond 2 hops. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough characterization of the performance of the entire spectrum of model-assisted routing algorithms ranging from little knowledge to complete knowledge of link dynamics."
1017089,15514,65,Development of a novel human-machine interface exploiting sensor substitution for structural health monitoring,2013,"For the last 20 years the goal of the structural health monitoring community has been to endow man-made structures with a biologically-inspired nervous system in order to detect, localize, and quantify damage in structures. The effort has focused on collecting a wide array of measurements from sensor networks, extracting features from the data, comparing the data to models, and trying to use this information to determine the presence, extent and type of damage. Typically the Structural Health Monitoring community tries to make predictions of the remaining service life of the structure. It is generally assumed that there will be as little human intervention in this process as possible unless a high-consequence decision must be made. A number of advances have been made in structural health monitoring using this approach over the course of the last decade, but we are still struggling to build autonomous machines that can match the ability of a human to detect, localize and quantify damage in structures. This work aims to explore a new paradigm - cooperative human-machine structural health monitoring. The premise of this paradigm is the idea that a human cooperating with a machine will always significantly outperform a machine or human acting independently. There is no reason to not make full use of human resources that are available to us today. Furthermore, the regulatory and litigious environments that exist today for safety-critical structures are going to make it difficult to adopt health monitoring systems that effectively eliminate humans. Why not instead enhance the natural sensing and perception of human inspectors? During the course of this research effort a vibro-tactile haptic interface is under development that will in some sense allow a human to “feel” the pain of a structure when it is damaged. A number of different studies from the neuroscience community [1], [2], have indicated that it is possible to use “sensory substitution” to provide some restoration for lost senses such as sight. In this work we consider the possibility of extending the introception of a human to an external structure. This type of capability will help enable a wide variety of cyber-physical systems that must maintain reliability as well as interact with humans. For instance it may be possible to outfit a single human inspector with a haptic interface so they can single-handedly monitor a whole wind farm as if it were a natural extension of their own body. Alternatively, a single person with a haptic interface may be able to sense the state-of-health of a large ocean linear or an entire swarm of flying robots. These ideas will lead to creating a new class of high-performance, cyber-physical systems."
1044633,15514,65,Learning structural affordances through self-exploration,2012,"The goal of this paper is to develop a cognitive developmental approach for a humanoid robot so that it can provisionally discover self-affordance relations between certain arm limb movements and corresponding motor units by exploring the outcomes of its random arm movements while in a crawling position. Learning of the right and the left arm affordances is based on self-exploration and a set of experience similarly to how a human baby discovers action-effect relations of own arm movements. We address the early development of self-affordances, similar to infants, which encodes the relationships between actions, objects, and the effect on the environment."
1101195,15514,104,Is min-wise hashing optimal for summarizing set intersection?,2014,"Min-wise hashing is an important method for estimating the size of the intersection of sets, based on a succinct summary (a min-hash) of each set. One application is estimation of the number of data points that satisfy the conjunction of m >= 2 simple predicates, where a min-hash is available for the set of points satisfying each predicate. This has application in query optimization and for approximate computation of COUNT aggregates.   In this paper we address the question: How many bits is it necessary to allocate to each summary in order to get an estimate with (1 +/- epsilon)-relative error? The state-of-the-art technique for minimizing the encoding size, for any desired estimation error, is b-bit min-wise hashing due to Li and Konig (Communications of the ACM, 2011). We give new lower and upper bounds:   Using information complexity arguments, we show that b-bit min-wise hashing is em space optimal for m=2 predicates in the sense that the estimator's variance is within a constant factor of the smallest possible among all summaries with the given space usage. But for conjunctions of m>2 predicates we show that the performance of b-bit min-wise hashing (and more generally any method based on k-permutation min-hash) deteriorates as m grows.   We describe a new summary that nearly matches our lower bound for m >= 2. It asymptotically outperform all k-permutation schemes (by around a factor Omega(m/log m)), as well as methods based on subsampling (by a factor Omega(log n_max), where n_max is the maximum set size)."
1424131,15514,65,"Playte, a tangible interface for engaging human-robot interaction",2014,"This paper describes a tangible interface, Playte, designed for children animating interactive robots. The system supports physical manipulation of behaviors represented by LEGO bricks and allows the user to record and train their own new behaviors. Our objective is to explore several modes of interaction, i.e. direct remote control, tangible programming, programming by demonstration, and programming by training, to learn the design principles for more accessible, engaging, and playful robots. We evaluate the system experimentally and report on key observations from play sessions. We conclude that Playte facilitates playful activities and is appropriate for the intended target group (age 6+). Further, we discuss lessons learned regarding pros and cons of the different supported interactions modes."
1436183,15514,65,Properties for efficient demonstrations to a socially guided intrinsically motivated learner,2012,"The combination of learning by intrinsic motivation and social learning has been shown to improve the learner's performance and gain precision over a wider range of motor skills, with for instance the SGIM-D learning algorithm [1]. Nevertheless, this bootstrapping a-priori depends on the demonstrations made by the teacher. We propose in this paper to examine this dependence: to what extend the quality of the demonstrations can influence the learning performance, and which are the characteristics of a good demonstrator. Results on a fishing experiment highlights the importance of the difficulty of the demonstrated tasks, as well as the structure of the actions demonstrated."
1331007,15514,65,Effects of off-activity talk in human-robot interaction with diabetic children,2014,"This paper presents the results from an experiment with a conversational human-robot interaction system aimed at long-term support for diabetic children. The system offers a set of activities aimed to help a child to improve its capability to manage diabetes. There is a large body of literature on the techniques that artificial agents can use to establish and maintain long-term social-emotional relationships with their users. The novel aspect in the present study is the inclusion of off-activity talk interspersed within talk pertaining the activity at hand and aimed to elicit the child's self-disclosure. The children in our study (N=20, age 11–14) were more interested to have another session with the robot when their interaction included also off-activity talk, even though there was no difference in the perception of the robot by the children between the groups with and without off-activity talk. Furthermore, individual interactions with the robot positively influenced the children's adherence to a therapy-related requirement, namely the filling in of a nutritional diary."
1606221,15514,65,Be the robot: Human embodiment in tele-operation driving tasks,2014,"This paper proposes a new interaction mechanism for tele-operating a mobile robot. The approach explores the notion of telepresence and physical embodiment to create what may be called tele-embodiment. Its principle is that the operator will see himself at the remote site and this will enable him/her to better operate the robot. Four interaction styles were experimentally compared, from the traditional joystick approaches to more innovative based on natural body posture intentions. The environment perception is provided by the visual feedback, according to head pose behaviour. The results show that the gesture and body based methods improves the user dexterity performing this kind of task. Moreover, the present study suggests that, when a person is focused on the task, achieving the ownership illusion towards remote body, there are autonomic responses that correspond to what would be expected in events that take place in reality (like avoiding collisions)."
1000878,15514,65,Attentional regulations in a situated human-robot dialogue,2014,"We propose a framework where the human-robot interaction is modeled as a multimodal dialogue which is regulated by an attentional system that guides the robot towards the execution of structured tasks. Specifically, we propose an approach where the dialogue between the human and the robot is represented as a Partially Obervable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), while the associated dialogue policy is enhanced by top-down attentional mechanisms that provide contextual and task-related contents. We introduce simple case studies that illustrate the system at work in different conditions considering top-down regulations and dialogue flows in synergistic and conflicting situations."
1470297,15514,65,Robot or tablet: Users' behaviors on a memory game,2014,"Robots will be more and more present in our daily life. Even if we guess that they will help us doing our tasks, their future roles remain unclear. Thus, it is important to explore how robots implicitly influence people, in order to design their future roles. This paper investigates human's behaviors in three game conditions: game with a robot alone, a tablet alone, and both robot and tablet. Results show that the presence of the robot induces no stress. Participants feel more pleasure when they play with the robot alone. Results also highlight that interacting simultaneously with a tablet and a robot could be experienced as a negative situation by people."
1661970,15514,65,Development of evaluation indexes for assistive robots based on ICF,2012,"With the aging population trends in developed countries, there is an increased expectation of the application of assistive robots. A variety of robots have been developed to address this challenge. Although there are many technical problems to be solved, the lack of objective evaluation indexes for evaluating the benefit to the users is one of the important problems to be addressed before the commercialization of the assistive robots can be realized. The ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) is a classification of the health components of functioning and disability, and is being utilized in medical, healthcare, and welfare fields. The ICF has a basic framework to evaluate healthcare and welfare equipment, including robots, and it will be the basis of the evaluation indexes for assistive robots. In this paper, we present the development of evaluation indexes, and provide the results of preliminary experiments which were conducted using iARM and RAPUDA robots performing a certain lifting task. The experiments illustrate the issues involved in the development of ICF-based indexes for assitive robots."
2516366,15514,65,Synchronization in a goal-directed task: Human movement coordination with each other and robotic partners,2011,"Synchronization occurs frequently in human behaviour: Everybody has experienced that in a group of people walking pace tends to equalize. The phenomenon of synchrony has been established in the literature in tasks which have little in common with daily life such as pendulum swinging and chair rocking. We extend the knowledge about human movement synchronization by showing that it also occurs during goal-directed actions. In a first experiment, we investigate how synchrony emerges develops over time. In a second experiment, we show that humans also synchronize their actions with a robot. Results are interpreted in the light of joint action theory. Possible implications and improvements for human-robot interaction are discussed."
1336397,15514,65,Natural user interface for Roombots,2014,"Roombots (RB) are self-reconfigurable modular robots designed to study robotic reconfiguration on a structured grid and adaptive locomotion off grid. One of the main goals of this platform is to create adaptive furniture inside living spaces such as homes or offices. To ease the control of RB modules in these environments, we propose a novel and more natural way of interaction with the RB modules on a RB grid, called the Natural Roombots User Interface. In our method, the user commands the RB modules using pointing gestures. The user's body is tracked using multiple Kinects. The user is also given real-time visual feedback of their physical actions and the state of the system via LED illumination electronics installed on both RB modules and the grid. We demonstrate how our interface can be used to efficiently control RB modules on simple point-to-point grid locomotion and conclude by discussing future extensions."
1871107,15514,65,What are you talking about? Grounding dialogue in a perspective-aware robotic architecture,2011,"While key for human-robot interaction, natural language interpretation is a notoriously difficult task, especially because the interaction context is at the same time essential for dialogue understanding, difficult to build for machines, and depends on each speaker point of view. However, robots as embodied artifacts, can perceive their environment and interactors, and hence compute symbolic models from various perspectives. This allows in turn to build symbolic contexts for dialogues. In this paper, we introduce DIALOGS, a component for natural language interpretation that relies on these structured symbolic models of the world to ground verbal interaction."
1725470,15514,65,The personal mobility interface including human twisting motion,2014,"This paper proposes the saddle type human body motion interface for personal mobility. The proposed interface uses not only conventional translational body motion but also twisting motion, and makes easy operation. The saddle is attached on the personal mobility by using the seat post with the universal joint at the floor of the personal mobility. The universal joint has three rotational joints where the potentiometers are attached on each. Hip motion makes these joints rotate. The potentiometers detect these rotations, and then this interface measures the hip translational and twisting motions. This saddle does not support whole user body weight, but it is sandwiched by legs and follows the hip motion. User keeps his/her standing position by strengths own legs. The saddle type interface doesn't need pre-setting for the operation, since this system doesn't require any sensors on the human body. By the basic experimental result, it turned out that proposed interface can operate personal mobility and has a potential for intuitive operation."
1184219,15514,65,Attentional and emotional regulation in human-robot interaction,2012,"In this paper, we propose a human-robot interaction system that exploits emotion and attention to regulate and adapt the robotic interactive behavior. In particular, we will focus on the relation between arousal, predictability, and attentional allocation considering as a case study a robotic manipulator interacting with a human operator. We rely on a frequency based model of attention allocation and a 4-dimensional model of emotion. The experiment reported in this paper explores the effectiveness of an attentional regulation mechanisms modulated by arousal and predictability values extracted from the human voice. The collected results show that the attentional modulation, mediated by basic emotional speech features, provides a natural and computationally light regulation mechanism for coordinating the robotic behaviors."
1705008,15514,65,Children's Openness to Interacting with a Robot Scale (COIRS),2014,Current human-robot-interaction research methods could benefit from an age-appropriate scale that measures children's attitudes towards robots. This paper presents the design process and evidence for the validity of the Children's Openness to Interacting with a Robot Scale (COIRS). We report findings from a pilot test on a diverse population of 172 U.S. students between the ages of 8–11. High average scores on the COIRS suggested that children in this sample were highly open to interacting with a robot.
1288100,15514,65,Evaluation of a tricycle-style teleoperational interface for children: A comparative experiment with a video game controller,2012,"A tricycle-style teleoperational interface for children to remotely control a robot was developed. There were two crucial requirements in its design: (1) the interface had to be intuitively controllable so that children could use it without requiring detailed instructions and (2) the control of the teleoperational system needed to be fun so that children did not get bored. In this paper, we report an experiment in which 20 children (4–8 years old) performed a range of tasks by remotely controlling a robot using two types of teleoperational interfaces: the tricycle-style interface and a standard video game controller. The results show that the children could perform the tasks better with the tricycle-style interface."
1628462,15514,65,A Bayesian approach for task recognition and future human activity prediction,2014,"Task recognition and future human activity prediction are of importance for a safe and profitable human-robot cooperation. In real scenarios, the robot has to extract this information merging the knowledge of the task with contextual information from the sensors, minimizing possible misunderstandings. In this paper, we focus on tasks that can be represented as a sequence of manipulated objects and performed actions. The task is modelled with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), which takes as input manipulated objects and performed actions. Objects and actions are separately classified starting from RGB-D raw data. The DBN is responsible for estimating the current task, predicting the most probable future pairs of action-object and correcting possible misclassification. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on a case of study, consisting of three typical tasks of a kitchen scenario."
1199208,15514,65,Development of memorizing system with action selection based on consciousness and behavior of animal on robot systems,2012,"This paper focuses on the development of interaction between humans and robots, we decided to give the robotic arm has a consciousness and an emotional behavior in the same way as humans and animals. Thus, we have developed the hierarchical structure model which is the relationship between consciousness field and behavior module. The model is called Consciousness-Base Architecture (CBA) that was combined with the motivation module. Moreover, the ability to learn and remember the situations, it is necessary to make for more intelligent robot. Thereby, we attempt to build a memory module in the robot system. The memory for such system needs to efficiently organize and recognize previous experience in order to retrieve the relevant data and compared with the current situation. In this paper, we present the evaluation function for autonomous action selection, the memory module has been built and the behavior of the robotic arm has been verified in the experiment."
1201565,15514,65,Stability and transparency improvement in haptic device employing both MR-brake and active actuator,2012,"An ideal haptic device should transmit a wide range of stable virtual model impedances (Z-width) with high transparency. Magneto-rheological fluid (MR) brakes are advantageous in haptic devices since they are passive actuators. However, they cannot provide high transparency and smooth interaction due to high viscous friction, residual torque, slow response, sticking and hysteresis effects. On the other hand, active actuators cannot simulate high virtual impedances stably, but provide high transparency with a closed loop control algorithm. In the proposed hybrid actuation a task divider control (TDC) algorithm was developed for torque sharing between two actuators to provide a large Z-width and improve both transparency and smoothness. The algorithm employs two parameters which were estimated experimentally and extended to entire achievable impedance range by artificial neural network (ANN) and curve fitting techniques. A 1-DOF device having an excitation motor at the user side and brushless DC motor and MR-brake in the haptic side was used in the experiments. The excitation motor is used to generate a white noise torque input to simulate a user for frequency domain transparency tests. Results of the proposed and conventional closed loop impedance control (CLIC) algorithms were compared. The proposed algorithm improves the transparency of MR-brake by eliminating its drawbacks and presents a larger Z-width than the active actuator alone."
1441418,15514,65,On using guided motor primitives to execute Continuous Goal-Directed Actions,2014,"In this paper, we study how human-robot interaction can be beneficial on the Continuous Goal-Directed Actions (CGDA) framework. Specifically, a system for robot discovery of motor primitives from random human-guided movements has been developed. These guided motor primitives (GMP) are used as scaffolds to reproduce a goal-directed actions. CGDA encodes goals as the changes produced on object features (color, area, etc) due to actions. This paper focuses on using motor primitives extracted from human-guided random robot movements to execute these goal-directed actions. The human guides the robot joints in random movements, which are later divided in small segments. These segments are compared in terms of joint positions and selected to be diverse. To perform goal-directed actions, the robot must discover an adequate sequence of GMP. To discover these sequences we organize the primitives as a tree with incremental depths (where each node represents a primitive) and use a breadth-first search. In one of the experiments performed, the robot executes a task based on spatial object features. In the other experiment, the goal is to paint a wall by following a color feature trajectory."
1672153,15514,65,A study to measure distance using monotone cubic hermite interpolation and marker recognition,2013,"This paper proposes a way to measure distance between a camera and marker using monotone cubic hermite interpolation and marker recognition. After vertex point of the marker at the image obtained from the camera, the marker using Counter-Clock-Wise (CCW) algorithm is detected and the size of this is saved. The distance value about the marker size is calculated by using hermite interpolation. By comparing new marker size and the values calculated, the distance is decided by the closest value. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective at processing time and accuracy and shows error rate under 5 percent."
1328325,15514,104,Pan-private algorithms via statistics on sketches,2011,"Consider fully dynamic data, where we track data as it gets inserted and deleted. There are well developed notions of private data analyses with dynamic data, for example, using differential privacy. We want to go beyond privacy, and consider privacy together with security, formulated recently as pan-privacy by Dwork et al. (ICS 2010). Informally, pan-privacy preserves differential privacy while computing desired statistics on the data,  even if the internal memory of the algorithm is compromised  (say, by a malicious break-in or insider curiosity or by fiat by the government or law).   We study pan-private algorithms for basic analyses, like estimating distinct count, moments, and heavy hitter count, with fully dynamic data. We present the first known pan-private algorithms for these problems in the fully dynamic model. Our algorithms rely on sketching techniques popular in streaming: in some cases, we add suitable noise to a previously known sketch, using a novel approach of calibrating noise to the underlying problem structure and the projection matrix of the sketch; in other cases, we maintain certain statistics on sketches; in yet others, we define novel sketches. We also present the first known lower bounds explicitly for pan privacy, showing our results to be nearly optimal for these problems. Our lower bounds are stronger than those implied by differential privacy or dynamic data streaming alone and hold even if unbounded memory and/or unbounded processing time are allowed. The lower bounds use a noisy decoding argument and exploit a connection between pan-private algorithms and data sanitization."
1062191,15514,65,Furniture layout AR application using floor plans based on planar object tracking,2012,"In this paper, we propose a new approach of Augmented Reality (AR) system for the furniture layout based on a planar object tracking. The planar object tracking methods using natural features are effective methods to estimate the object's pose and position in the AR applications because we are able to use the natural images. However, most of the feature descriptors have a lot of matching procedure. Therefore, by using an efficient feature point descriptor which is very fast both to build and to match, we track the planar objects. Especially, we use floor plans as the planar objects, and then furniture CG models are overlaid on the floor plans. This is because the floor plans are presented in the selection of rooms for rent or buy. Therefore, this system helps borrowers and buyers to select some mansion or apartment rooms. In this system, we propose to use human whistle sounds and color rectangles recognition to operate the furniture layout. In order to show the effectiveness of our proposed system, we perform some planar object tracking experiments when we applied the proposed system to some floor plans."
1281627,15514,65,How to support action prediction: Evidence from human coordination tasks,2014,"When two or more people perform actions together such as shaking hands, playing ensemble music or carrying an object together, they often naturally adjust the spatial and temporal parameters of their movements to facilitate smooth task performance. This paper reviews recent findings from experiments with human participants to demonstrate ways in which individuals strategically modulate their own action performance to support a task partner in predicting their actions and thereby facilitate coordination. Based on this evidence, it is discussed how strategic action modulation (“action signaling”) might be a useful approach also for robotic systems to assist human users, thereby reducing cognitive load and flexibly supporting the acquisition of new skills."
1709476,15514,65,Human-machine interaction as key technology for driverless driving - A trajectory-based shared autonomy control approach,2012,"New mobility concepts for urban traffic will benefit from driverless driving. However, fully autonomous driving is not currently feasible in mixed urban traffic. Teleoperation with distinct human-machine interaction is required to manage such highly complex automation tasks. This work discusses the possibility of a safe and reliable approach to the teleoperated driving of road vehicles in urban environments. Based on the current state of the art, this study derives a new trajectory-based approach using the methodology of shared autonomy control. Here, control is based on automated driving along predefined paths. The study shows that trajectory-based driving is fast enough for inner-city traffic and guarantees safety in case of operator connection loss."
1733040,15514,65,Hot-spot detection by group interaction extraction from trajectories,2013,"We present a method for detecting hot-spots from surveillance videos via the extraction of group interactions (defined as stable and continuous spatial proximity of multiple objects). With a method that we propose for multi-object tracking in the multi-view scenario, we collect the trajectories of objects, from which we detect the group interactions. We assume that the movement of each object is driven by its interest of interaction, and model a group interaction by the mutual interests between objects. We solve detection of group interactions as a tracking problem, which first extracts unit-interactions by grouping objects at each individual frame, and then temporally associates them into continuous group interactions. We perform experiments on a publicly available dataset, and show that our tracking method achieves an accuracy around 95% and our detected group interactions could recall 80% of manually annotated hot-spots."
1411733,15514,65,Target object color-based force feedback compensation control in master-slave systems,2014,"Visual color information is thought to affect human perception. This study proposes a master-slave system that performs force feedback compensation control based on the color of the target object. In this system, the ratio between forces exerted during tasks performed on dark and bright objects is used as a compensatory gain in the feedback force. The system is designed to maintain task consistency by ensuring a constant magnitude of force exerted during a task, even when the color of the target object varies. Basic experiments demonstrated that operators exert different forces on objects of the same weight but different color; in particular, the brightness of an achromatic object affects human perception of the force applied to it. In verification experiments, the difference between the force exerted on same-weight bright and dark colored objects by a master-slave system with no color-based compensation control was 2.24 N. Implementing the proposed control system, this difference was improved to 0.61 N. Therefore, this system can potentially ensure consistent work during tasks involving target objects of different colors."
1502569,15514,65,Human-aided robotic grasping,2012,"In order to provide a user-friendly system with simple operation command to grasp different objects successfully, this paper describes a combined approach of real time remote vision-based teleoperation and autonomy for a human-aided robotic grasping. In the teleoperation process, motion tracking is carried out by Kinect in real time to detect the positions of the human shoulder, elbow and hand joints such that the robot can imitate the human. Hand gestures are recognized and used to activate autonomous grasping, which can save time and generate more natural grasping poses. In our system, the robot fulfills some special tasks such as picking up objects using easy commands with Kinect as object sensor. Experiment results show that it is effective and user-friendly."
1301359,15514,65,Autonomous Humanoid Robot Dance Generation System based on real-time music input,2013,"There have been many attempts made by companies and researchers to make people feel more familiar with robots. As one example, Dance performance of Entertainment Robot could conceivably provide an event that would be seen easily in a public place. In most cases, however, programmers' and researchers' workload, if they were to attempt to program dance motions for a robot and synchronize them, would be too heavy. In addition, pre-programmed dance motion and synchronization information are useful only for one certain music and are useless for any other music input. To solve these problems, we have introduced a new system that can make a robot dance automatically with real-time music input. The system consists of two main parts: the first is a real-time beat extraction system for music; the second one is a system of dance motion for a humanoid robot. In the first part, music input is analyzed using FFT and peak-to-peak time duration in the low frequency area is computed. In the second part, the process of making and synchronizing the dance motion of the humanoid robot is described. Finally, we perform experiments to check the validity of the proposed system. Also, limitations and further work are described."
1451746,15514,65,Towards an intuitive interface for instructing robots handling tasks based on verbalized physical effects,2014,"A long-term goal in current robotic research is the development of intuitive interfaces for human-robot interaction. Here, one field of application are object manipulation tasks. Such tasks consist of grasping, moving, and placing objects [1]. In this work, we focus on the subtask of moving an object, which is also called the handling of the object. We present a method for the intuitive instruction of handling tasks through verbal commands and the execution based on verbalized physical effects. We define a set of principal physical effects and describe how a physical effect can be verbalized. Furthermore, we indicate how verbal parameters can qualitatively be transformed into robot control parameters using physics. At last, we show in a user study, that the proposed method is feasible for the intuitive instruction of handling tasks to a robot system."
1191100,15514,65,Different gaze behavior in human-robot interaction in Asperger's syndrome: An eye-tracking study,2013,"Social robots are often applied in recreational contexts to improve the experience of using technical systems, but they are also increasingly used for therapeutic purposes. In this study, we compared how patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) interact with a social robot and a human actor. We examined the gaze behavior of nine ASD patients and 15 matched controls using a mobile eye-tracker. Participants performed a task in which they were required to follow the gaze of a robot or human actor. Our results show that ASD patients preferentially maintain eye contact during interaction with the social robot as compared to the human actor."
2106047,15514,65,Effect of human guidance and state space size on Interactive Reinforcement Learning,2011,"The Interactive Reinforcement Learning algorithm enables a human user to train a robot by providing rewards in response to past actions and anticipatory guidance to guide the selection of future actions. Past work with software agents has shown that incorporating user guidance into the policy learning process through Interactive Reinforcement Learning significantly improves the policy learning time by reducing the number of states the agent explores. We present the first study of Interactive Reinforcement Learning in real-world robotic systems. We report on four experiments that study the effects that teacher guidance and state space size have on policy learning performance. We discuss modifications made to apply Interactive Reinforcement Learning to a real-world system and show that guidance significantly reduces the learning rate, and that its positive effects increase with state space size."
1233114,15514,65,Teaching Robots New Actions through Natural Language Instructions,2014,"Robots often have limited knowledge and need to continuously acquire new knowledge and skills in order to collaborate with its human partners. To address this issue, this paper describes an approach which allows human partners to teach a robot (i.e., a robotic arm) new high-level actions through natural language instructions. In particular, built upon the traditional planning framework, we propose a representation of high-level actions that only consists of the desired goal states rather than step-by-step operations (although these operations may be specified by the human in their instructions). Our empirical results have shown that, given this representation, the robot can reply on automated planning and immediately apply the newly learned action knowledge to perform actions under novel situations."
1617145,15514,65,Hand motion recognition using hybrid sensors consisting of EMG sensors and optical distance sensors,2012,"Many hand motion recognition methods using Electromyogram (EMG) signals have been developed. Because most studies used only surface EMG signals from a forearm, available motion-related information was limited. In this paper, we report a SVM (Support Vector Machine) based hand motion recognition method using hybrid sensors. The hybrid sensor consists of an EMG sensor and an optical distance sensor, and can measure myoelectric activities and distance between the sensor and the skin surface at the same time. It is expected that distance changes caused by muscle elevation compensate the limited information derived from myoelectric activities. To examine the effectiveness of our method, we performed hand motion recognition experiments with four subjects. Experimental results showed that our method using hybrid sensors can improve motion recognition accuracy compared to when using only EMG signals."
1419092,15514,65,Communication through physical interaction: A study of human collaborative manipulation of a planar object,2014,"In this paper we describe our progress towards understanding human communication through physical interaction. We describe a classification algorithm that can recognize four classes of actions that frequently occur during collaborative manipulation of planar objects. These actions were selected based on a user study involving dyads of elderly and care-giver in a realistic setting. Further user studies were conducted to collect the data necessary to develop the classification algorithm. As part of the data collection we also developed a sensory glove. The classification algorithm gives insight into human collaborative manipulation. More precisely, it identifies features in the data that are significant for classification. This information is particularly interesting as it only relies on physical aspects of the interaction and not on any particular sensor. As a result, the described work does not depend on any particular hardware and can be directly used by other researchers in human-robot interaction to develop further experiments and studies."
996414,15514,65,Pedestrian-inspired sampling-based multi-robot collision avoidance,2012,"We present a distributed collision avoidance algorithm for multiple mobile robots that is model-predictive, sampling-based, and intuitive for operation around humans. Unlike purely reactive approaches, the proposed algorithm incorporates arbitrary trajectories as generated by a motion planner running on each navigating robot as well as predicted human trajectories. Our approach, inspired by human navigation in crowded pedestrian environments, draws from the sociology literature on pedestrian interaction. We propose a simple two-phase algorithm in which agents initially cooperate to avoid each other and then initiate civil inattention, thus lessening reactivity and committing to a trajectory. This process entails a pedestrian bargain in which all agents act competently to avoid each other and, once resolution is achieved, to avoid interfering with others' planned trajectories. This approach, being human-inspired, fluidly permits navigational interaction between humans and robots. We report experimental results for the algorithm running on real robots with and without human presence and in simulation."
2431052,15514,65,A case study on the effect of feedback on itinerary requests in human-robot interaction,2011,"A previously conducted study on human-human communication in the context of itinerary requests in public space resulted in “feedback” being the most powerful influencing factor regarding the successfulness of conversations between humans. In this paper, we report on a subsequently performed Wizard-of-Oz (WOz) experiment that applied the results from the human-human study to human-robot interaction. The participants interacted with a Nao robot in a cardboard model town, where the robot asked them for directions to a specific destination. It was the aim of this experiment to validate the importance of adequately timed feedback in human-robot communication. The experiment could show that feedback is a crucial factor for successful human-robot interaction in the context of asking for directions. Adequately timed and appropriately deployed feedback fosters a vivid and natural flow of communication."
1353443,15514,65,Investigating the influence of culture on proxemic behaviors for humanoid robots,2013,"In social robotics, the behavior of humanoid robots is intended to be designed in a way that they behave in a human-like manner and serve as natural interaction partners for human users. Several aspects of human behavior such as speech, gestures, eye-gaze as well as the personal and social background of the user need therefore to be considered. In this paper, we investigate interpersonal distance as a behavioral aspect that varies with the cultural background of the user. We present two studies that explore whether users of different cultures (Arabs and Germans) expect robots to behave similar to their own cultural background. The results of the first study reveal that Arabs and Germans have different expectations on the interpersonal distance between themselves and robots in a static setting. In the second study, we use the results of the first study to investigate the users' reactions on robots using the observed interpersonal distances themselves. Although the data of this dynamic setting is not conclusive, it suggests that users prefer robots that show behavior that has been observed for their own cultural background before."
1797512,15514,507,Efficient processing of distance queries in large graphs: a vertex cover approach,2012,"We propose a novel disk-based index for processing single-source shortest path or distance queries. The index is useful in a wide range of important applications (e.g., network analysis, routing planning, etc.). Our index is a tree-structured index constructed based on the concept of vertex cover. We propose an I/O-efficient algorithm to construct the index when the input graph is too large to fit in main memory. We give detailed analysis of I/O and CPU complexity for both index construction and query processing, and verify the efficiency of our index for query processing in massive real-world graphs."
795024,15514,65,Motion design based on normative motion derived from human - Implementation to personal mobility,2013,"This paper considers that the framework of intuitive interface of personal motility is the combination of the Intention Extractor and Motion Designer, which are the natural extraction of user intention and the human-like system's motion respectively. This research proposed the motion design which makes mobility's motion to be human-like by focusing on the Motion Designer in this framework. For designing human like motion, we need a certain normative motion to the personal mobility. In order to derive the normative motion, we collected the human motion when human moves to lateral direction. The collected motion data was mapped to the phase plane to eliminate time components. On the phase plane, each subject's motion was almost same ellipse, although they have differences in time domain. Then we did ellipse fitting to get one ellipse as the normative motion. For implementing the normative motion, which was fitted ellipse, to the personal motility, the derived normative motion was converted to time function by using t as a parameter. By this manner, personal mobility moved based on the normative motion. In order to verify whether the normative motion is human like or not, the sensory evaluation experiment by Paired Preference Test was conducted. In this experiment, two motions were prepared. One was derived normative motion, the another was “machine motion” which is controlled by the constant speed control inputs. From the result of the test, it turned out that the proposed normative motion is human-like compared with the constant speed motion."
816959,15514,65,Controller synthesis for human-robot cooperative swinging of rigid objects based on human-human experiments,2014,"Cooperative dynamic object manipulation extends the manipulation capabilities of human-robot dyads. This paper investigates cooperative swinging of rigid objects with the goal of reaching a desired level of energy, i.e. a desired object height. A human-human pilot study indicates that the arm-object-arm system can be approximated by a simple pendulum with two-sided unidirectional pulsed torque actuation. Based on the results of the human-human experiments, a robotic leader and follower controller are synthesized. Multi-body simulations based on human-like parameters successfully replicate the characteristics observed in the human-human experiments."

The purpose of this work is to provide animators and artists easy and intuitive tools to design expressive motions for humanoid robots. A review of similar work in the computer animation community has guided our choices regarding the implementation and level of interaction between the user and an inverse dynamics solver. We have used our controller on a model of the Aldebaran humanoid robot Nao, and have generated a few expressive locomotion patterns that are presented in the experimental section of this paper."
2199916,15514,65,Implementation of context-adaptive physical imitation between humans and robots,2011,"In this paper we propose a model of context-adaptive imitation between multi-human and multi-robot. In this model, first, a humanoid robot extracts human's intention from his/her behaviors, utterances, and situations. Secondly, the robot communicates this intention not only to other robots through a network, but also to humans through the robot's body expressions. Thirdly, the robot who received the intention generates context-adaptive behaviors according to the situation. We implemented this robot system for a guided task for visitors using the architecture of situated modules. We discuss the validity and availability of the proposed model using the case-study of the guided task by the implemented robot system."
1375867,15514,104,New results on two-dimensional orthogonal range aggregation in external memory,2011,"We consider the  orthogonal range aggregation  problem. The dataset  S  consists of  N  axis-parallel rectangles in R 2 , each of which is associated with an integer  weight . Given an axis-parallel rectangle  Q  and an aggregate function  F , a query reports the aggregated result of the weights of the rectangles in  S  intersecting  Q . The goal is to preprocess  S  into a structure such that all queries can be answered efficiently. We present indexing schemes to solve the problem in external memory when  F  =  max  (hence,  min ) and  F  =  sum  (hence,  count  and  average ), respectively. Our schemes have linear or near-linear space, and answer a query in  O (log  B   N ) or  O (log B  2 / B  N ) I/Os, where  B  is the disk block size."
1492330,15514,65,Evaluation of rescue support stretcher system,2012,"A Sarin gas attack occurred in the Tokyo subway system on March 20, 1995. This fatal gas attack sickened many passengers. Since the disaster broke out underground, the main job of the rescue personnel was to transport victims on stretchers to a first-aid station above the ground. Therefore, we researched the development of a rescue support stretcher system for handling heavy casualties in underground areas or at stations in a quick and effective manner. The stretcher system is expected to help firefighters achieve efficient rescue operations. In this paper, we introduce a rescue support stretcher system for going up and down stairs. We also propose an upgrade technique. Finally, we experimentally examine the effectiveness of the system."
1879785,15514,65,Assessing human-robot performances in complex situations with unit task tests,2012,"This paper presents a test battery method to investigate (relative) operational upsides and downsides of robot innovations. This method was applied to test the teleoperated Generaal robot and the NIFTi robot that could be operated in manual and semi-automatic mode for navigation and situation sensing. The unit tasks of our test battery proved to be discriminatory to assess differences between the robots. Most often the performance with the Generaal was faster than the semi-autonomous NIFTi robot, whereas the semi-autonomous NIFTi robot had sometimes less collisions. To lower workload for operators there is a clear need for a semi-autonomous robot, but the current version needs improvement on the planning and path-finding to better perform on speed."
1863873,15514,65,Manipulating anthropomorphic inferences about NAO: The role of situational and dispositional aspects of effectance motivation,2011,"In an experiment we empirically tested one key determinant of Epley's Three-Factor Theory of Anthropomorphism: Specifically, we investigated the interplay of both dispositional and situational facets of effectance motivation in predicting anthropomorphic inferences about the robot NAO. That is, we manipulated the predictability of the robot's behavior and whether participants anticipated an interaction with NAO. Innovatively, we also examined interindividual differences in participants' desire for control, a dispositional aspect of effectance motivation. Taken together, we go beyond previous work by (1) increasing ecological validity of the experimental setting; by (2) extending the range of measures to assess anthropomorphism, and by (3) examining the role of contextual and dispositional components of effectance motivation for anthropomorphism. Because this is the first work to study the interplay between these factors, our work contributes to a better theoretical and empirical understanding of psychological anthropomorphism."
816654,15514,65,Weight aids system for Horse Riding Robot Simulator,2014,"A rider communicates with a horse to control the horse. This type of communication, collectively known as riding aids, is important in horse riding. When the rider communicates with the horse during horse riding, the horse determines the rider's command with its own intelligence and controls its own motors. We expect that probability factors can represent the riding aids and they can be used to control the horse. Therefore, we propose a probability model of riding aids, especially weight aids. To estimate the probability of the weight aids, we devised a sensor-equipped saddle that measures the vertical force. These sensors calculate the Center of Gravity (COG). In experiments, the rider rides on the horse with the sensor-equipped saddle and the sensors record the COG data depending on the rider's commands. Finally, we formulated the probability of the weight aids as rider commands. The probability of weight aid can be a prior probability of other riding aid probability, and we expect that the rider can control a horse robot simulator with theses probability models."
1685643,15514,65,Shut up and play: A musical approach to engagement and social presence in Human Robot Interaction,2014,"With a view to studying the development of social relationships between humans and robots, it is our contention that music can help provide extended engagement and open ended interaction. In this paper we explore the effectiveness of music as a mode of engagement using Mortimer, a robot able to play a drum kit and employing a composition algorithm to respond to a human pianist. We used this system to conduct a comparative study into the effects of presenting the robot as a social actor or as an instrument. Using automated behavioural metrics, including face tracking, we found that participants in the social actor condition played for longer uninterrupted and stopped the robot mid-performance less. They also spent more time looking at the robot when not playing and less time looking at the piano when playing. We suggest these results indicate greater fluency of playing and engagement and more feelings of social presence towards the robot when presented as a social actor"
2288714,15514,65,Saliency-based boundary object detection in naturally complex scenes,2011,"A stochastic scheme is presented for cooperative detection of landmark objects distributed in roadway boundaries. By indexing chromatic diversity within a locally Gaussian color space, saliency patterns are extracted with respect to the as-is primary system. Through saccadic scan of the saliency patterns, boundary objects are successively articulated into a system of fractal attractors consistent with the ground-object structure. As the result, the fractal model is indicated within the perspective of the naturally complex scenes."
1012848,15514,65,Study of conditions for safe and efficient traffic in an indoor blind corner-based decision model with consideration for tactics and information uncertainty,2012,"In this paper, we studied the conditions require to ensure the safety and efficient traffic of pedestrians walking in an indoor blind corner-based decision model by determining their behavior. This model was constructed with consideration for tactics that affect when person encounter each other using a mixed strategy from game theory, which we expanded using the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence for the adaptation of behavioral changes caused by information uncertainty. We determined the conditions required for safe and efficient traffic, and we verified their effectiveness in a simulation using a decision model. Based on the knowledge obtained from this verification, we tested an implementation of a system that supported safety and efficient traffic in an indoor blind corner-based model."
1250505,15514,65,How to move towards visitors: A model for museum guide robots to initiate conversation,2013,"Museum guide robots should observe visitors in order to identify those who may desire a guide, and then initiate conversation with them. This paper presents a model for such robot behavior. Initiation of conversation is an important concern for social service robots such as museum guide robots. When people enter into a social interaction, they tend to situate themselves in a spatial-orientational arrangement such that each is facing inward around a space to which each has immediate access. When this kind of particular spatial formation occurs, they can feel that they are participating in the conversation; once they perceive their participation, they will subsequently try to maintain this spatial formation. We developed a model that describes the constraints and expected behaviors in initiation of conversation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly improves a robot's performance in initiating conversation."
1586379,15514,65,"Designing & developing QueBall, a robotic device for autism therapy",2014,"It is known that children with autism can benefit from interacting with robotic devices. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA identifies around 1 in 68 American children as being on the autism spectrum. Other countries also have similar prevalence rates. Therefore, providing therapeutic devices is becoming of increasing importance. Here we address the problem of effectively designing and building a robotic device fit for this purpose. The robot we have designed uses a simple spherical morphology together with a collection of autonomous behaviors and controllable modalities. The platform, is robust, simple, safe, and provides a wide range of movement, visual, sound and touch interaction capabilities to encourage the child to learn and play."
1294397,15514,65,A Qualitative method to analyze response in robotic intervention for children with autism,2013,This paper presents a method to carry out qualitative analysis when evaluating the interaction between child and robot in autism intervention. The technique consists of 24-items of behavioral assessment which was referenced to the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition (GARS-2). GARS-2 is a screening instrument used to identify and diagnose autism. Preliminary results from a pilot study show that this method had allowed qualitative observation to be carried out to compare the behavior of autistic children with and without the presence of a robot. The feasibility of this technique will be further justified through future wide-spread studies involving a larger number of children spanning across the whole spectrum of autism.
1508207,15514,65,Ispy-usign humanoid assisted interactive sign language tutoring games,2013,"The work presented in this paper was carried out within an on-going project which aims to assist in Sign language tutoring to children with communication problems by means of interaction games with a humanoid robot. In this project, the robot is able to express words in the Turkish Sign language (TSL) and American Sign Language (ASL), and having comprehended the word, the child is motivated to give relevant feedback to the robot with colored flashcards, signs and sound. Within the multi-modal turn-taking games, child both learns the semantic and the realization of the words, besides have chance to test this information through imitation based interaction games. The performance of the children is also verified with flash card based activities as a part of the game, as a feedback for the teacher/parent. Child's performance is recognized and evaluated by the robot through an RGB-D camera based system. This paper summarizes a longitudinal exploratory study from a classroom work, where children were taught 6 gestures including signs from ASL and TSL with the assistance of a Nao H25 humanoid robot. The performances of the children and robot are presented and discussed in terms of children's subjective and objective evaluations."
1739316,15514,65,Enabling robots to make use of the structure of human actions - A user study employing Acoustic Packaging,2013,"Human learning strongly depends on the ability to structure the actions of teachers in order to identify relevant parts. We propose that this is also true for learning in robots. Therefore, we apply a method for multimodal action segmentation called Acoustic Packaging to a corpus of pairs of users teaching object names to a robot. Going beyond previous use cases, we analyze how the structure of human actions changes if the robot is learning quickly or slowly. Our results reveal differences between action structuring in the conditions such as longer utterances and more motion when the robot learns slowly. We also evaluate how the partners in the pair influence each other's action structuring. The results show a strong correlation between the participants in the pairs, even more so in the trials where the robot is learning slowly. We conclude that the action structuring based on Acoustic Packaging allows robots to differentiate how well the interaction with multiple users is going and is, thus, a vehicle for feedback generation."
2516110,15514,65,Using the visitor experiences for mapping the possibilities of implementing a robotic guide in outdoor sites,2012,"FROG (Fun Robotic Outdoor Guide) is a project that aims to develop an outdoor robotic guide that enriches the visitor experience in touristic sites. This paper is a first step toward a guide robot and presents a case study on how to analyze the visitors' experience and examine opportunities for a future robot guide in the sites. We adopted the participatory design method for mapping the visitor experience; the end users of the tourist sites participated actively in finding and discussing their experience of visiting. Results indicated that visitors especially like the structure of the tour and the stories provided, especially interesting little known facts the guide gives. However, they do not like the rushed pace of a guided tour. When exploring the site by themselves, they enjoy the freedom, the time to make pictures and to concentrate on what interests them. Visitors do not like a lack or overload of information or problems with route finding. Not all guide-related factors that influence a visitor's experience positively can be copied one-on-one to a robot guide. And care needs to be taken to identify those aspects of guided tours and guide behaviors that will be effective for robot-guided tours. In this paper we describe the first step towards the realization of an outdoor robotic guide. We evaluate people's experiences of guided tours to inform the design of robot-guided tours. This analysis forms the basis for ongoing research into the development of effective robot behaviors."
1741652,15514,65,Taskability Graph: Towards analyzing effort based agent-agent affordances,2012,"Affordance analysis, what something/someone can afford or offers, is an important aspect for day-to-day interaction and decision-making. In this paper, we will enrich the notion of affordance by incorporating agent-agent affordance: what does an agent afford for another agent in terms of a task. Further, we will present an effort hierarchy and derive the concept of Taskability Graph, which encodes: what all agents could do for all other agents, with which levels of mutual-efforts and at which places. This makes the robot more aware about agents' abilities and facilitates to develop better interaction and decision-making capabilities. We will discuss the potential application in effort based shared cooperative planning."
1292845,15514,65,Human reaction to given instructions in cooperative task with embodied agents,2012,"In face-to-face communication, we can confidently communicate through our bodies. Recently, agents have widely surfaced as existences that interact with humans, and several studies have investigated the formation of social relations with such agents. This study focuses on the possibility that the impression of embodied agents and the way of interpreting information offered by them changes owing to different environments where humans and agents exist as well as the method through which instructions are given. We examined the effects of sharing an environment in two cooperative task experiments in real/virtual worlds. Our result shows that the reliability of the information provided by the agent is improved by sharing the same environment with the agent through the body. The method of giving the instructions must also correspond to the task environment."
2184643,15514,65,Composition of behaviour primitives for entertainment humanoid robots,2011,"This article introduces a model for representing motion primitives for entertainment humanoid robots using Generalized Hierarchical AND/OR graphs. On the one hand, the goal is to drive robots with scripts, as if they were on a stage. On the other hand, the approach allows for storing a minimum amount of behaviours, thereby reducing on-board memory and computational requirements. Standard ontology-based reasoning mechanisms are used to operate on such a representation, in a fully hierarchical fashion. Experimental validation has been assessed using toy Kondo robots."
1972588,15514,65,A different approach of using Personas in human-robot interaction: Integrating Personas as computational models to modify robot companions' behaviour,2013,"The current paper focuses on a novel integration of the Personas technique into HRI studies, and the definition of a Persona-Based Computational Behaviour Model for achieving socially intelligent robot companions in living environments. Our core interest is the creation of companions adapted to users' needs to support their activities of daily living. The aim is to create a mechanism that allows us to develop initial robot behaviour, i.e. behaviour when first encountering the user, which is already adapted to each user without the necessity of collecting in advance a large dataset to train the system. A persona represents the specific needs of many individuals for a particular scenario. This technique helps us develop initial robot behaviour adapted to user needs, and so reduces the amount of trials that participants have to perform during early stages of the system development. The paper describes how this behaviour model has been created and integrated into a functional architecture, and presents the motivation, background and conceptual framework for this new research direction. Future empirical studies will validate this approach and expand the initial definition of our model."
1327903,15514,65,Building a game scenario to encourage children with autism to recognize and label emotions using a humanoid robot,2014,"This paper presents an exploratory study in which children with autism interact with ZECA (Zeno Engaging Children with Autism). ZECA is a humanoid robot with a face covered with a material allowing the display of varied facial expressions. The study investigates a novel scenario for robot-assisted play, to help promoting labelling of emotions by children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The study was performed during three sessions with two boys diagnosed with ASD. The results obtained from the analysis of the children's behaviours while interacting with ZECA helped us improve several aspects of our game scenario such as the technical specificities of the game and its dynamics, and the experimental setup. The software produced for this study allows the robot to autonomously identify the answers of the child during the session. This automatic identification helped the fluidity of the game and freed the experimenter to participate in triadic interactions with the child. The evaluation of the game scenario that will be used in a future study was the main goal of this pilot study, rather than to quantify and evaluate the performance of the children. Overall, this exploratory study in teaching children about labelling emotions using a humanoid robot embedded in a game scenario demonstrated the possible positive outcomes this child-robot interaction can produce and highlighted the issues regarding data collection and their analysis that will inform future studies."
2140434,15514,65,Development of a novel robot-mediated adaptive response system for joint attention task for children with autism,2011,"With Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prevalence estimates for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at 9.1 per 1,000 (1 in 110), identification and effective treatment of ASD is often characterized as a public health emergency. Emerging technology, especially robotic technology, has been shown to be appealing to these children and such interest can be harnessed to address the limitations while providing intervention services to young children with ASD. Generally the spectrum nature of autism calls for intensive, individualized intervention. However, existing robot-mediated systems tend to have limited adaptive capability that limits individualization. Our current work seeks to bridge this gap by developing a novel adaptive and individualized robot-mediated technology for children with ASD. The system is composed of a humanoid robot with its vision being augmented by several wall-mounted cameras for real-time head tracking using a distributed architecture. Based on the cues from the child's head movement, the robot intelligently adapts itself in an individualized manner to promote joint attention. The developed system is validated with two typically developing children. The validation results of the head tracker and the closed-loop nature of interaction are presented."
1391451,15514,65,Evaluation of control factors affecting the operator's immersion and performance in robotic teleoperation,2012,"This paper presents the results of an experimental study in which users teleoperating a mobile robot evaluated three controllers: a keyboard, a game controller, and a touchpad interface. It is motivated by the need to engage a broader, non-expert user audience in teleoperation as robots become more prevalent in everyday applications. Analysis focuses on how specific control elements and the user's comfort with a device improve the operator's sense of immersion in the task and how this alters performance. Our results show that perceived controllability of the controller, users' level of technological anxiety, and the physical nature of feedback from the controller had an effect on user feelings of immersion and presence. Our findings have implications for the development of controllers that can be used for teleoperating robots by a broad user audience."

The proposed PSN system has fusion components for automatic localization and facial recognition that uses multiple Kinect sensors and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras. We verified that the generic vision schemes utilized in human detection and facial recognition algorithms were interoperable in a scenario that consisted of virtual avatar humans. In experiments, we tested a perception scenario in which multiple humans in a 3D simulation space are automatically recognized in both location and identification with real-world system parameters."

Preliminary empiric results about this interaction, in the scope of search and rescue applications, demonstrate the need for deeper studies on how humans should interact with teams of autonomous mobile robots and on how to establish a mutual beneficial interaction. This work presents the work in progress in the scope of CHOPIN 1  project, which aims to address some of these issues and will focus on devising new methods for collaborative context awareness and context sharing between teams of humans and teams of robots."
2471654,15514,65,Crowdsourcing human-robot interaction: Application from virtual to physical worlds,2011,"The ability for robots to engage in interactive behavior with a broad range of people is critical for future development of social robotic applications. In this paper, we propose the use of online games as a means of generating large-scale data corpora for human-robot interaction research in order to create robust and diverse interaction models. We describe a data collection approach based on a multiplayer game that was used to collect movement, action and dialog data from hundreds of online users. We then study how these records of human-human interaction collected in a virtual world can be used to generate contextually correct social and task-oriented behaviors for a robot collaborating with a human in a similar real-world environment. We evaluate the resulting behavior model using a physical robot in the Boston Museum of Science, and show that the robot successfully performs the collaborative task and that its behavior is strongly influenced by patterns in the crowdsourced dataset."
1224620,15514,65,Possibilities of Androids as poetry-reciting agent,2012,"In recent years, research has increased on very human-like androids, generally investigating the following: (1) how people treat such very human-like androids and (2) whether it is possible to replace such existing communication media as telephones or TV conference systems with androids as a communication medium. We found that androids have advantages over humans in specific contexts. For example, in a collaboration theatrical project between artists and androids, audiences were impressed by the androids that read poetry. We, therefore, experimentally compared androids and humans in a poetry-reciting context by conducting an experiment to illustrate the influence of an android who recited poetry. Participants listened to poetry that was read by three poetry-reciting agents: the android, the human model on which the android was based, and a box. The experiment results showed that the enjoyment of the poetry gained the highest score under the android condition, indicating that the android has an advantage for communicating the meaning of poetry."
997785,15514,65,A real-time EMG/ECG monitoring system over the internet,2012,"Bioinstrumentation to estimate a human internal status such as emotion, fatigue, and mental stress, is significant for watching over persons. Infrastructure of sensor nodes network and its devices are also required for realization of such measurement system. Therefore, in this paper, authors introduce a new EMG/ECG monitoring system over the Internet. In their previous works, they developed small wireless EMG/ECG electrode called VAMPIRE-BAT (Variables Adjustable Multi-Purpose Intelligent Remote-controlled Electrode for Bio-signal Amplification and Transmission) However, VAMPIRE-BAT is ZigBee based device and its effective communication range is limited up to 20 m. Then, they newly developed a range extending system called WIVERN (Web Interfaced Vampire-bat for Extra Range Networking). This system is an Internet gateway for VAMPIRE-BAT. Bio signals are firstly uploaded to a nearby server using ZigBee communication, then the data are immediately ready for download. The availability of the prototype system is examined by an out-door experiment."
2203383,15514,65,Evaluation of action-similarity awareness effect in rhythm ensemble co-creation,2011,"There are many robots which have communication skills with human but most of their actions and responses are preprogrammed and few researches inspect psychological aspects of behavior in human-robot co-creation. In this paper, we focus on action-similarity awareness as a key for building up co-creative relationship with humans. Here, action-similarity awareness means that one recognizes affinity to one's own actions derived from other's actions. As a simple task involving action-similarity awareness, we focused on rhythm ensemble. The ensemble is a type of drumming session in which even people who have little musical experience easily take part. In this research we expect to realize the awareness in the rhythm ensemble session by employing the other's past action and mixing it to metrical structure, a basic beat structure in music. To make sure of this idea in real session, we developed a robot system which can actually play a drumming session with humans and control action-similarity awareness. We conducted a subjective experiment and analyzed questionnaire and interaction record. From the questionnaire results, it was confirmed that the sense of prediction increases with action contributing rate and that it is effective to imitate humans actions and add 10% to 30% originality. From the interaction record it was confirmed that phrase structure was shared by making consent on which part to be varied or fixed."

Tasks that exemplify this interaction include a robotic porter, carrying heavy suitcases, or a robot carrying groceries. As many users may not be robotics experts, we argue that such interaction schemes must be accessible, easy to use and understand. In this paper, we present a dog-leash interface that enables a person to lead a robot simply by holding the leash, following a dog-leash interaction metaphor. We introduce variants on dog-leash robotic interaction, present our original interface implementation, and detail our formal qualitative evaluation, exploring how users perceive and accept the dog leash robotic interaction."
1581616,15514,65,Teleoperated android as an embodied communication medium: A case study with demented elderlies in a care facility,2012,"Teleoperated androids, which are robots with humanlike appearances, are being produced as new media of human relationships. We explored the potential of humanoid robots and how they affect people in the real world when they are employed to express a telecommunication presence and a sense of ‘being there’. We introduced Telenoid, a teleoperated android, to a residential care facility to see how the elderly with dementia respond to it. Our exploratory study focused on the social aspects that might facilitate communication between the elderly and Telenoid's operator. Telenoid elicited positive images and interactive reactions from the elderly with mild dementia, even from those with severe cognitive impairment. They showed strong attachment to its child-like huggable design and became willing to converse with it. Our result suggests that an affectionate bond may be formed between the elderly and the android to provide the operator with easy communication to elicit responses from senior citizens."
1958530,15514,65,Indirect human-robot task communication using affordances,2011,"One problem in current human-robot task communication is the laborious need to define action and target object parameters for each task request. This paper's solution to the problem is to enable indirect task communication by mimicking the human cognitive ability to understand affordances, i.e. action possibilities in the environment with respect to different actors. This enables humans to communicate tasks using only the task-related action or target object names, and thus avoid the need to remember explicit task request utterances. The proposed task communication is integrated as a subsystem into an existing service robot, and its functionality is evaluated through a set of user experiments in an astronaut-robot task communication context. Affordance-based indirect task communication is shown to successfully reduce the workload experienced by the human and to decrease task communication times, while also being the preferred way to communicate tasks."
2347488,15514,65,Relation between skill acquisition and task specific human speech in collaborative work,2011,"To accomplish the objective to make human-collaborative robots, we need to clarify how humans actually interact each other when they do collaborative work. In this study, we transcribed all utterances produced while participants' completing human-human collaborative conveyer task, and computed and categorized all morphemes (minimal unit of language meaning) using 4 categories based on the morpheme's role in the task. The role categories were Robot Action, User Action, Modifier, Object. We analyzed the utterances produced by 4 groups, 3 participants in each group. Results were that frequency of each category per minute decreased over ten trials. However, the variety of words in each category tended to show an inverted U-shaped pattern. Based on these results, we proposed three stages of language skill acquisition in a collaborative work."
2003333,15514,65,A study of human performance in recognizing expressive hand movements,2011,"This paper presents a study on human performance in recognizing affective expressions conveyed through movements of hand-like structures. One movement sequence, closing and opening the hand, was performed by a demonstrator in 3 sets of 5 repeated trials, each set intending to convey a different affective expression. Three different expressions, sadness, happiness and anger, were considered. Expressive movement animations were replicated with a human-like hand model, a stick hand model and with a model resembling a palm frond structure. The structures tested have identical kinematics but different physical appearance. The ability of a human to correctly identify the intended expressive movements performed on these different structures was tested with 66 users viewing videos of the animated structures and reporting via an online questionnaire. Results show that anger is reliably perceived by observers from animated movements on different structures, while the other emotions are easily misperceived. The physical appearance of the structure has some impact on perception performance, but was not found to be statistically significant in this study. Furthermore, analyzing the participants' responses in the context of the valence-arousal model of emotion shows that the subjects were able to recognize the arousal component of the affective hand movements across all structures."
2539072,15514,65,The proposal of model-based initial frame alignment using real-coded GA for mixed reality,2011,"In this paper, we propose a model-based alignment system using real-coded genetic algorithm (RGA) for mixed reality (MR) or augmented reality (AR). MR/AR is a technique for superimposing useful virtual information on the real world to provide users more effective views. To realize the MR/AR, the alignment between real space and virtual space is a serious problem. In particular, an initial frame alignment for real-time tracking is needed in the previous knowledge based MR/AR. Therefore, we propose an initial frame alignment method using RGA. In this paper, we use the multiple RGA generation alternation models, crossovers, and mutations to design an optimum GA for the alignment system. This paper shows the expanding version of the pre-proposed method by our system. In order to show the effectiveness of proposed method, we perform some matching simulations when we applied to the real space."
1551538,15514,65,Character extraction from the region pointed at with a fingertip for the visually handicapped,2012,"We have proposed a system that recognizes text characters from the region pointed at with a fingertip for the visually handicapped. For example, in a supermarket, the blind user can pick up and touch the goods. However, the user cannot read the characters printed on the surface of the object. He/she cannot exactly know what the object is. It is very inconvenient for him/her. The proposed system will help the user to recognize the characters on the object. The system detects the ring which the user wears on the index finger and calculates the position of the user's fingertip of the index finger. Some acrylic infrared-reflective beads are arranged on the ring and it is easy to detect them from an infrared image. After fingertip detection, a region in which characters to be recognized is generated according to the position of the fingertip. The characters are extracted within the region using image processing. Thus, the redundant character recognition is avoided. The extracted characters are combined as a text and the text is read aloud by OCR software and free reading software for the user. Some experiments show the basic validity of the proposed method and system."

Relevant determinants, such as mood, self-efficacy and happiness are discussed in this paper in relation to older people. We offer an overview of previous work on robots offering psychological support and analyse the various methodological challenges in studying the effects of motivational and psycho-therapeutic robots on elderly people's psychological well-being."
2212481,15514,65,Robot recommender system using affection-based episode ontology for personalization,2013,"This paper proposes a robot recommender system, which uses a hybrid filtering method based on n-gram affective event model. Nowadays there are strong tendency to utilize a robot for educational services, which can provide educational contents to enhances individual student's motivation. However, the current service robots can be more holistic systems to offer personalized robotic services to satisfy every individuals by reflecting their preferences. Here, robotic service can be another field to meet personal need. Hybrid approaches of personalization technology that combine collaborative filtering approaches and content-based approaches are proposed over the last decade. Especially, n-gram based approaches are proposed to utilize sequential information from very large data sets. This paper suggests an extends affective event model and its n-gram model combining fact semantic knowledge, event episodic knowledge and emotion. To show the validity of the proposed approach, we applied the scenario of English learning. The experiment results shows that an educational service robot recommend two students as different content types, even though they miss same question."
2365148,15514,65,An approach to promote social and communication behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders: Robot based intervention,2011,"Most autistic people present some difficulties in developing social behavior, living in their own world. This study has the goal to improve the social life of children with autism with a main focus in promoting their social interaction and communication. It is necessary to call for children's attention and enforce their collaboration, where a robot, LEGO MindStorm, behaves as a mediator/promoter of this interaction. A set of experiments designed to share objects and fulfill simple orders, by the 11 years old autistic child at the time of daily routine work and in-game with the robot, are described. The generalization of the acquired skills by the child in new contexts and environments are also tested. Results are described showing the outcomes of the experiments."

1819391,15514,65,A speech-driven embodied group entrainment system with the model of lecturer's eyeball movement,2012,"We have already developed a speech-driven embodied group entrained communication system called “SAKURA” for activating group interaction and communication. In this system, a speech-driven computer graphics (CG) characters called InterActors with functions of both speaker and listener are entrained to one another as a teacher and some students in a virtual classroom by generating communicative actions and movements. In this study, for the basic research of realizing smooth communication during embodied interaction between human and robot, we analyzed the eyeball movements of a lecturer communicating in a virtual group by using an embodied communication system with a line-of-sight measurement device. On the basis of the analysis results, we propose an eyeball movement model that consists of a saccade model and a model of a lecturer's gaze at an audience, called “group gaze model.” Then, we developed an advanced communication system in which the proposed model was used with SAKURA for enhancing group interaction and communication. This advanced system generates a lecturer's eyeball movement on the basis of the proposed model by using only speech input. We used sensory evaluation in the experiments to determine the effects of the proposed model. The results showed that the system with the proposed model is effective in group interaction and communication."
2310838,15514,65,Development of avatar generating system by constructing portraits made by friends,2013,"Recently, the Remote communication through the Internet has been performed actively. And as a remote communication tool, the uses of graphic avatars are especially popular in Japan. However, in many cases, the avatar used on the communication is not mirrored to a user who creates the avatar himself using the application software provided for the remote communication support system. Therefore, the remote friends cannot imagine the appearance of the user from his/her avatar at all. In this research, we will propose a method of creating an avatar. The method shows that the avatar is constructed by merging some portraits, which are created by user's friends. We have developed the prototype systems for creating a portrait and an avatar composed of some portraits. This paper describes methods and systems of creating a portrait and an avatar. We performed some experiments to evaluate the usability of the proposed system and the quality of an avatar created on the proposed system. As an experimental result, it is revealed that the avatar, which is created on the proposed system, tends to be preferred by the user and friends."
1322329,15514,65,An exercise motivational system for walking rehabilitation using the Smart Walker,2013,"Because declining rates of population growth have left aging societies in many countries around the world, Smart Walker systems were created to assist elderly people in managing their physical, cognitive, and emotional challenges. While the main application of the Smart Walker is to assist in the daily life of the elderly, it may also be used to assist in rehabilitation. In this paper, a no-contact system is proposed to motivate exercise on a Smart Walker. A tablet device is attached to the chair in front of the user to serve as a channel for interaction. The tablet device has several modalities for expression including a 3D robot-face character, TTS (Text to Speech), and dialog messaging. The exercise motivational system selects appropriate expressions to display on the tablet device, from pre-recorded behavioral data, using real-time data from the movements of the patient."
1440087,15514,65,Social distance augmented qualitative trajectory calculus for Human-Robot Spatial Interaction,2014,"In this paper we propose to augment a wellestablished Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) by incorporating social distances into the model to facilitate a richer and more powerful representation of Human-Robot Spatial Interaction (HRSI). By combining two variants of QTC that implement different resolutions and switching between them based on distance thresholds we show that we are able to both reduce the complexity of the representation and at the same time enrich QTC with one of the core HRSI concepts: proxemics. Building on this novel integrated QTC model, we propose to represent the joint spatial behaviour of a human and a robot employing a probabilistic representation based on Hidden Markov Models. We show the appropriateness of our approach by encoding different HRSI behaviours observed in a human-robot interaction study and show how the models can be used to represent and classify these behaviours using social distance-augmented QTC."
1963785,15514,65,Target person identification and following based on omnidirectional camera and LRF data fusion,2011,"In this paper, we present the current progress of our approach to identify and follow a target person for a service robot application. The robot is equipped with LRF and Omni directional camera. Our approach is based on multi-sensor fusion in which a person is identified using the panoramic image and tracked using the LRF. The selection of the target person is implemented to improve the identification when multiple candidates are detected. Our approach is successfully implemented on a mobile robot. A simplified target person following behavior is implemented to focus on the proposed method's efficiency. Several experiments are conducted and showed the effectiveness of our approach to identify and follow human in indoor environments."

2276701,15514,30,Simulation of an Instrumental Childbirth for the Training of the Forceps Extraction: Control Algorithm and Evaluation,2011,"This paper presents the control algorithm implanted on the childbirth simulator BirthSIM in order to provide training to novice obstetricians. The forceps extraction is an obstetric manipulation learned by experience. However, nowadays the training is mainly provided during real childbirths. This kind of training could lead to dramatic consequences due to the lack of experience of some operators. This paper explains the approach that has been used to simulate the dynamic process of a childbirth on the BirthSIM simulator. We especially focus on one procedure that reproduces a difficult instrumental delivery. The recorded tractive force to extract the fetus corresponds to the literature results that confirm the realism of the simulator. The novice results emphasize the need of a childbirth simulator in order to gain initial experience without any risks."
1241298,15514,65,Driving assistance through pedal reaction force control with consideration of JND,2013,"In this study, a driving assistive system using an active force control for an accelerator pedal is proposed. First, using a driving simulator embedded with a haptic pedal mechanism, driver's just noticeable difference (JND) against the force perception on the pedal was investigated experimentally. Second, an algorithm of the conscious/unconscious assistive control is presented by utilizing the identified JND. Through verification experiment on the same simulator, the conscious assistive was successful with a probability of 83%. However, the unconscious assistive was failed with a probability of 79% and the drivers noticed the assist with a probability of 73%."
1768290,15514,65,Voluntary self-tapping induces self-localization shift,2014,"Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) is known to provide a proprioceptive drift toward the direction where the rubber hand is tapped. On the other hand, Out-of-Body Experiences (OBEs) induce an entire body shift from a third-person Point of View (PoV). These experiences are known to trigger external passive tactile cues. Telexistence allows an entire body shift from a first-person PoV, compared to RHI and OBE. However, the precise origin of the entire localization is not revealed when we actively provide the internal voluntary tactile cue. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the effects of tactile cues to determine self-localization during the action of self-tapping. Participants viewed and tapped their own body on the back, and evaluated where on their body they perceived the tapping. The experiments show that the localized position tends to shift forward when an individual is tapped by a third-person; in contrast, the localized position tends to shift backward when an individual is tapping his own back. The subjective report indicates that participants perceived themselves as leaving their own bodies, or that someone appeared in front of them suddenly. Thus, we consider that self-produced tactile cue induces telexistence experience."
1649241,15514,65,Human-Robot exploration,2014,"Humans use a variety of technological artefacts to explore outer space, with robotics developing as an important field. Space exploration also provides an opportunity to develop social robotics. It has been shown that prolonged social isolation increases the tendency to anthropomorphise nonhuman agents. While it is recognised that an illusion of humanness can be successfully created in inanimate objects, whether it is possible to maintain such an illusion over time remains to be understood. Manned space missions provide an example of intense isolation, hence, a particularly sharp focus on our tendency to anthropomorphise and an opportunity for long-term Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) studies. The use of social robots in space missions will contribute to understanding anthropomorphism and social interaction that involves not only astronauts but also other socially isolated individuals who are often targeted in HRI research. This paper adopts the stance that the goal of social robotics in a space exploration context is to constructively develop an illusion of human traits in a machine in order to either help manage a need for a degree of social interaction, or to extend human sensing and action through more immersive telepresence robotics."
991759,15514,65,Multimodal biometric identification system for mobile robots combining human metrology to face recognition and speaker identification,2014,"Recognizing a person from a distance is important to establish meaningful social interaction and to provide additional cues regarding the situations experienced by a robot. To do so, face recognition and speaker identification are biometrics commonly used, with identification performance that are influenced by the distance between the person and the robot. This paper presents a system that combines these biometrics with human metrology (HM) to increase identification performance and range. HM measures are derived from 2D silhouettes extracted online using a dynamic background subtraction approach, processing in parallel 45 front features and 24 side features in 400 ms compared to 38 front and 22 side features extracted in sequence in 30 sec by using the approach presented by Lin and Wang [1]. By having each modality identify a set of up to five possible candidates, results suggest that combining modalities provide better performance compared to what each individual modality provides, from a wider range of distances."
807629,15514,65,Kinect depth image based door detection for autonomous indoor navigation,2014,"In this paper, an indoor navigation algorithm is proposed for the purpose of robot autonomous path planning. Due to the complex situation in indoor environments, it can cause a serious trouble for robot to identify the route during patrolling, especially for corner and door detection, which is the key step for intelligent navigation. To solve this problem, a kinect sensor is used for the door detection and corner location via depth images. The continuously varied ratios and depth difference in the images have been analyzed for the corner and door identification. Furthermore, the precise position of the doors and corners can be localized via the 3-dimensional characteristics of the depth images. Experiments in different scenarios have been performed to verify the efficacy of the algorithm for robot indoor autonomous navigation."
1681669,15514,65,Inferring the goal of an approaching agent: A human-robot study,2012,"The ability to infer intentions and predict actions enables coordinating of one's own actions with those of another human and allows smooth and intuitive interaction. The aim to achieve equally effective human-robot interactions is a crucial aspect of current robotic studies. Thus, we assume that studying human-human interaction provides valuable insights allowing to implement mutual intention recognition and action prediction in robotic systems. A common scenario of interaction, be it in everyday life or in an industrial setting, is that two or more agents share the same workspace and perform tasks without interference. If humans are involved, the robots should act sufficiently predictable to enable the human to attribute goals and predict motion trajectories. In the present work, we first analyzed how well a human recognizes the goal of another person entering the room, and whether this ability is deteriorated by concealing gaze direction of the other person. In a second setup, the same experiment was repeated by replacing the approaching person with a wheeled robot. On average, the distance at which subjects predicted the goal of the approaching agent was approx. 4 m and depended on subject and goal position, but not on the type of agent. However, goal attribution showed a considerable proportion of errors for the robot (19%), much less for a human with hidden gaze direction (6%), and almost none for a human with visible gaze (1%). Thus, our subjects apparently decided on the goal of the approaching agent without taking into account the reliability of directional cues, thus resulting in more errors. In a human-robot setting, such wrong predictions about robotic behavior may easily lead to dangerous situations. For smooth and safe interaction, it is therefore important to ameliorate the predictability of robotic actions."
1414171,15514,65,A robot as fitness companion: Towards an interactive action-based motivation model,2014,"The topic of motivation is a crucial issue for various human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. Interactional aspects of motivation can be studied in human-human interaction (HHI) and build the basis for modeling a robot's interactional conduct. Using an ethnographic approach we explored the factors relevant in the formation of motivation-relevant processes in an indoor-cycling activity. We propose an interactive, action-based motivation model for HRI that has been implemented in an autonomous robot system and tested during a long-term HRI study. The model is based on micro-analyses of human indoor cycling courses and resulted in an adaption of specific dialog patterns for HRI. A qualitative evaluation - accompanied by a quantitative analysis - demonstrated that the transfer of interaction patterns from HHI to HRI was successful with participants benefitting from the interaction experience (e.g., performance, subjective feeling of being motivated)."
1941888,15514,65,Exploring minimal nonverbal interruption in HRI,2011,"Designing robotic behaviours capable of initiating an interruption will be extremely important as robots increasingly interact with people. Consequently, we explore the social impact of a minimal set of physical nonverbal cues that can be exhibited by a robot to initiate robot-human interruption: (a) speed of motion, (b) gaze, (c) head movement, d) rotation and (e) proximity to the person. We present two related studies evaluating this set. First, for requirements gathering, we observed the behaviour of interruption between humans, with a human actor attempting to interrupt other humans while being constrained to use only a set of behavioural cues that could be mimicked by a simple nonverbal robot. Next, we programmed a robot to exhibit similar social physical nonverbal cues, and tested their feasibility in a user study of robotic nonverbal interruption across interruption scenarios. Our results show that people were able to interpret interruption urgency from robot behaviour using only minimal nonverbal behavioural cues. These findings contribute to informing future designs of social human-robot interfaces."

Femtocell networks reuse the spectrum resources in co-channel environments due to its high geometric density. In this paper, a distributed algorithm is proposed, which uses a cluster-based self-organizing approach to managing the spectrum and power resources among femtocells. The aim of the proposed algorithm is to achieve an optimized throughput of the networks in a decentralized manner. The algorithm involves three phases: sensing phase, sniffer phase, and power control phase, and is performed in each femtocell. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the uplink throughput of the femtocell networks and effectively avoids interference with the conventional macro-cellular networks."
1811219,15514,65,Dialog strategies for handling miscommunication in task-related HRI,2011,"As communication quality in public spaces often is impaired by noisy environment, it is difficult for a robot to retrieve missing task-information from humans. In this paper, different dialog strategies are modeled and evaluated with respect to user experience and error handling capabilities in HRI in order to cope with erroneous speech recognition. Since correct recognition of spoken language is a bottleneck for real-world dialog systems, special emphasis is placed on the issue of adapting dialog strategies to the conditions under which the dialog is held to thereby provide for adaptability of the dialog strategy to variable speech recognition performance. Experimental evaluations are conducted in a fully automated indoor setting, and in a Wizard-of-Oz outdoor setting. Results indicate that a critical point exists, up to which the use of requests for handling miscommunication improves the user experience of a dialog strategy."
1929166,15514,65,Minimizing task-induced stress in cognitively stimulating activities using an intelligent socially assistive robot,2011,"Dementia is currently a growing epidemic, bringing forth severe health, social, and economic strains. As an alternative to pharmacological measures, current research supports the effectiveness of using cognitive training interventions to slow the decline of or even improve brain functioning in persons with dementia. However, implementing and sustaining these interventions on a long-term basis can be challenging as they demand considerable resources and people. Our research focuses on investigating the potential use of robotic assistants to allow for these interventions to become more accessible to users and caregivers. Namely, the aim of our work is to develop socially assistive robots that can provide cognitive and social stimulation for persons with dementia. In this paper, we study the social interaction attributes of the human-like robot, Brian 2.0, during a one-on-one person-centered cognitively stimulating activity to determine if the robot is capable of minimizing task-induced stress by providing assistance, encouragement, and celebration, while adapting its behavior to a user state during the course of the activity. Our preliminary study shows that the social intelligence of Brian 2.0 is effective in engaging individuals in a cognitively stimulating game while minimizing stress during gameplay."

In this paper we investigate the motion planning of handovers while accounting for the human mobility. We treat the human motion as part of the planning problem thus enabling to find broader type of handing strategies. We formalize the problem and propose an algorithmic solution taking into account the HRI constraints induced by the human receiver presence. Simulation results with the PR2 robot illustrate the efficacy of the approach."
1553598,15514,65,Assessing the acceptability of human-robot co-presence on assembly lines: A comparison between actual situations and their virtual reality counterparts,2014,"This paper focuses on the acceptability of human-robot collaboration in industrial environments. A use case was designed in which an operator and a robot had to work side-by-side on automotive assembly lines, with different levels of co-presence. This use case was implemented both in a physical and in a virtual situation using virtual reality. A user study was conducted with operators from the automotive industry. The operators were asked to assess the acceptability to work side-by-side with the robot through questionnaires, and physiological measures (heart rate and skin conductance) were taken during the user study. The results showed that working close to the robot imposed more constraints on the operators and required them to adapt to the robot. Moreover, an increase in skin conductance level was observed after working close to the robot. Although no significant difference was found in the questionnaires results between the physical and virtual situations, the increase in physiological measures was significant only in the physical situation. This suggests that virtual reality may be a good tool to assess the acceptability of human-robot collaboration and draw preliminary results through questionnaires, but that physical experiments are still necessary to a complete study, especially when dealing with physiological measures."
1688905,15514,65,Identifying principal social signals in private student-teacher interactions for robot-enhanced education,2013,"Providing robots with social intelligence is critical for making entertaining and sustainable human-robot interactions. The first step to get good social intelligence is to appropriately understand the meaning of social signals emitted by interactors. In this paper, we introduce a preliminary study on identifying principal social signals in interpreting participant's engagement and confirmation intention in 1:1 interactions. We annotated 6 video recordings of private teacher-student interactions with 20 social signals and their interpretations, and built pattern data sets with different subsets of social signals. C4.5 based decision trees were generated using the pattern data sets and the recall rates were compared. Also attribute selection was performed to find principal social signals. The results showed that verbal signal was the most principal for determining engagement, and the combination of gaze and verbal signal for confirmation intention."

We analyze the EEG observed when subjects are listening to music by 3 kinds of stereo speaker system with different acoustic property. In this paper, as the first step of quantification, we analyze whether the difference of acoustic quality appear EEG by principal component analysis, analysis of variance and Fisher discriminant analysis. As a result, we confirmed that 1st principal component of EEG contains the imformation of acoustic quality evaluation which we can not obtain from questionnaires, and the possibility that we can use EEG for quantitative evaluation of acoustic quality."

Through experiments of tennis forehand swing coaching task for beginners, we observed and analyzed three kinds of motions; a learning target swing performed by human coaches, swings performed by learners, and dynamically modified swing motions by human coaches according to performances of learners. With results, we modeled relationship between differences among the three motions in a phase space and used symbolic expressions. Then we discussed how the model can be applied for realizing an efficient motion coaching system we have been proposed."

The method combines rate control and a variable scaled position mapping to realize accurate and efficient teleoperation. Haptic feedback in these two mapping modes is designed with emphasis on ergonomics to improve immersion of teleoperation. A dead zone is defined in master side to guarantee system stability when mode switches. We illustrate our method on teleoperation path tracking and target positioning tasks and compare the results with two widely used methods: rate control and scaled position mapping. The comparison experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid motion mapping method is the most efficient method for path tracking and the most accurate one for target positioning.
1189288,15514,65,Human-preference-based control design: Adaptive robot admittance control for physical human-robot interaction,2012,"Aiming at the application in physical human-robot interaction, this paper presents a novel adaptive admittance control scheme for robotic manipulators. Special emphasis is drawn on the avoidance of oscillatory behavior in the presence of closed kinematic chains while keeping the rendered impedance low. The approach uses an online fast Fourier transform of the measured manipulator endeffector forces in order to detect oscillations and to adapt the admittance parameters dynamically. As a novel method towards human-centered control design the adaptation strategy is determined in a user study evaluated with a machine-learning algorithm. Experiments conducted with ten human participants show superiority over the non-adaptive admittance control scheme."
1461351,15514,65,Real-time hand guiding of industrial manipulator in 5 DOF using Microsoft Kinect and accelerometer,2013,Human computer interaction is currently developing toward more intuitive and natural ways of communication. The main goal of research presented in this paper is the development of a system for controlling a robot manipulator in 5 DOF using human motions. The developed system reads and interprets sensor data from a Microsoft Kinect and an accelerometer embedded in a smartphone and use this data and the robot kinematics to generate a position and orientation reference to the robot controller allowing real-time interaction with the robot. The system has been implemented and tested on a Universal Robot manipulator arm with 6 joints. This robot has an embedded controller able to receive a reference in both Cartesian and joint space and calculate and track trajectories that fulfills this reference. The main result of this research is the architecture of an industrially oriented hand guiding system.
1592881,15514,65,Extreme human-robot interfaces: Increasing trust and assurance around robots,2014,"This paper approaches the issues of human-robot interaction in extreme human-robot interface situations, defined as those which provide a real physical intervention in a person's body by a robot. Robots that belong to this group perform tasks such as tattooing, collecting blood and doing surgery. Authors use a Lynxmotion AL5B mechanical arm controlled via Botboarduino named BOTicelli to make simple patterns with a felt-tip pen on volunteers' skin. The patterns are composed by clusters of dots, similar to real-world tattooing techniques. This paper intends to understand the major discomforts experienced by volunteers while interacting with BOTicelli and whether there are possible modifications of robot design or procedures that would render the experience less aggravating for humans."
2163629,15514,65,"Help, I need some body the effect of embodiment on playful learning",2012,"Children with a chronic disease like diabetes need to learn how to self manage their disease. Knowledge about their condition is indispensable to reach this goal. Within the European project ALIZ-E a robot companion is being developed that should, among others attributes, have the capability to educate children. In this paper, a virtual agent on a screen is compared with a physical robot on the aspects of performance (learning), attention and motivation. The experiment consisted of two sessions in which children played a quiz consisting of health related questions with both the robot and the virtual agent, there was a week between the two sessions. It was found that performance and motivation were not affected by the embodiment, but the robot did attract more attention and, when forced to choose, the children had a preference for the robot."
1483433,15514,65,Single-channel particular voice activity detection for monitoring the violence situations,2013,"The proposed algorithm in this paper is capable of classifying not only unusual speech when people get anger, surprised, or excited but also unusual noise such as clashing, hitting, or clapping in real-time without depending on particular speaker voices or utterances. Also, it does not require a prior learning process to construct acoustic models. This algorithm, therefore, allows a surveillance camera system to effectively monitor quarrel or violent situations regardless of object shields and light conditions. To realize our approach, we analyze the variance and change of spectral densities and pitches when unusual speech and noise occur. We then propose new methods (SEBNI, USDF, and UNDF) to classify unusual sounds in real-time. Moreover, to improve performance, we apply a noise suppression system based on MMSE-STSA and a statistic model-based VAD to our algorithm in order to extract reliable voice features and segment only voice-related periods in noisy environments. We confirm that our proposed method achieves an 87% accuracy performance for classifying unusual speech."
1947936,15514,65,Incorporating a model of human panic behavior for robotic-based emergency evacuation,2011,"Evacuating a building in an emergency situation can be very confusing and dangerous. Exit signs are static and thus have no ability to convey information about congestion or danger between the sign and the actual exit door. Emergency personnel may arrive too late to assist in an evacuation. Robots, however, can be stored inside of buildings and can be used to guide evacuees to the best available exit. To enable this process, evacuation robots must have an understanding of how people react in emergency situations. By incorporating a model of human panic behavior, these robots can effectively guide crowds of people to zones of safety. In this paper, we discuss an initial design of these robots and their behaviors. Preliminary simulation results show that a significantly larger proportion of people are evacuated with robot assistance than without."
2435911,15514,65,Robotic agents used to help teach social skills to children with Autism: The third generation,2011,"This paper reports on the cross-collaborative efforts between computer science, special education and mechanical engineering on some of the robotic platforms used in therapeutic environments, and our investigation of using robots as educationally useful interventions to improve social interactions for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Development of a third generation robotic agent is described which uses an approach to treatment as an educational intervention based on Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR), direct instruction pedagogy, the use of social scripts, and our investigative process of using Lego® NXT platforms."
1805465,15514,65,A behavior combination generating method for reflecting emotional probabilities using simulated annealing algorithm,2011,"This paper presents a behavior generating method for reflecting emotional probabilities. The proposed method consists of two processes: an emotion-behavior probability generating process and a unit behavior combination generating process. 1) In the emotion-behavior probability generating process, the emotional probabilities of behaviors are determined on the basis of user preferences in terms of the priorities of emotions. 2) In the unit behavior combination generating process, optimal behaviors are found by the simulated annealing algorithm. A final behavior is a set of selected parts of expressions. It is possible to not only reveal an abundance of expressions without one-to-one mapping relations between emotions and behaviors but also apply these expressions in the case of various robots. We have verified the diversity of emotional expression by applying the proposed method to two different robot systems, which are a cyber robot simulator and a real robot system."
2105950,15514,65,Towards culture-specific robot customisation: A study on greeting interaction with Egyptians,2013,"A complex relationship exists between national cultural background and interaction with robots, and many earlier studies have investigated how people from different cultures perceive the inclusion of robots into society. Conversely, very few studies have investigated how robots, speaking and using gestures that belong to a certain national culture, are perceived by humans of different cultural background. The purpose of this work is to prove that humans may better accept a robot that can adapt to their specific national culture. This experiment of Human-Robot Interaction was performed in Egypt. Participants (native Egyptians versus Japanese living in Egypt) were shown two robots greeting them and speaking respectively in Arabic and Japanese, through a simulated video conference. Spontaneous reactions of the human subjects were measured in different ways, and participants completed a questionnaire assessing their preferences and their emotional state. Results suggested that Egyptians prefer the Arabic version of the robot, while they report discomfort when interacting with the Japanese version. These findings confirm the importance of a culture-specific customisation of robots in the context of Human-Robot Interaction."
1543679,15514,65,Vibrotactile display approach that modifies roughness sensations of real textures,2012,"In this study, we developed vibrotactile display methods that can assist designers in product design. In order to achieve realistic sensations required for such designing purposes, we used real materials such as cloth, paper, wood, and leather and applied vibrotactile stimuli to modify the roughness sensations of these materials. This approach allowed us to present textures of various virtual materials with a strong sense of reality. We verified that our proposed methods could selectively modify the fine and macro-roughness sensations of real materials. The methods are expected to aid product designers in deciding tactile sensations suitable for their products."
1858505,15514,65,Human-robot interactions as theatre,2011,"Given the difficulty of social human-robot interaction (HRI), finding an appropriate conceptual model, as well as a useful venue to test the model, is key. While most work in social HRI draws insight and inspiration from the field of social psychology, this paper explores the philosophical backing and benefits of using ideas from theatre to frame social interactions. We present an analogy to Searle's Chinese Room argument to motivate the expressive challenges faced by human actors and by robots in social situations. We then compare the elements of theatre with the elements of HRI, and discuss techniques that we believe will lead to improved interactions."
1404268,15514,65,A novel robotic neck for realizing an anatomically accurate android head targeting facial perception research,2014,"we describe a novel robotic neck mechanism that supports realistic human head motion. Our design uses a 3-DOF spherical neck inspired by the 2-DOF spherical wrist of the Orthoglide 5-axis industrial robot. We use a gimbal-like mechanism to combine three 1-DOF motion components to rotate the head about a common point and around the three principal axes. Based on this design, we implemented and compared our neck in an android called Uma using human expressive neck motion specifications to ensure it is capable of human-like motion. Based on our evaluations, the neck has been shown to be suitable for perception experiments that require human-like head motion."
2133832,15514,65,Negative affect in human robot interaction — Impoliteness in unexpected encounters with robots,2013,"The vision of social robotics sees robots moving more and more into unrestricted social environments, where robots interact closely with users in their everyday activities, maybe even establishing relationships with the user over time. In this paper we present a field trial with a robot in a semipublic place. Our analysis of the interactions with casual users shows that it is not enough to focus on modeling behavior that is similar to successful human interactions but that we have to take more deviant ways of interaction like abuse and impoliteness into account when we send robots into the users' environments. The analysis uses impoliteness theory as an analytical toolbox and exemplifies which strategies are employed by users in unexpected encounters with a humanoid robot."
1969612,15514,65,Simon plays Simon says: The timing of turn-taking in an imitation game,2011,"Turn-taking is fundamental to the way humans engage in information exchange, but robots currently lack the turn-taking skills required for natural communication. In order to bring effective turn-taking to robots, we must first understand the underlying processes in the context of what is possible to implement. We describe a data collection experiment with an interaction format inspired by “Simon says,” a turn-taking imitation game that engages the channels of gaze, speech, and motion. We analyze data from 23 human subjects interacting with a humanoid social robot and propose the principle of minimum necessary information (MNI) as a factor in determining the timing of the human response.We also describe the other observed phenomena of channel exclusion, efficiency, and adaptation. We discuss the implications of these principles and propose some ways to incorporate our findings into a computational model of turn-taking."
1416957,15514,65,Rapid prototyping framework for robot-assisted training of autistic children,2014,"Research in uptake and actual use of robots in socially assistive tasks is rapidly growing. However, practical applications lack behind due to the enormous effort to create meaningful behaviours. This paper describes a rapid prototyping framework for robot-assisted training of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The main goal of this research is to provide a framework which translates the knowledge from the evidenced Pivotal Response Training to end-user tools, that allow therapists to program/adapt a training program mediated by a robot in order to use it in therapies. The overall structure of the intervention is based on Activity Theory which makes it easy to properly arrange robot actions and decisions. We appended a general end-user robot programming tool with PRT therapy-specific training structures which can be adapted with ease to create almost limitless learning opportunities utilizing a range of training scenarios or games. Pilot tests with children with ASD were performed to assess whether the robot assisted intervention created by this framework is ready for practical use. These showed that only minor adaptations were needed to increase the fluency of the robot-child interaction."
1894919,15514,65,Development of an interaction-activated communication model based on a heat conduction equation in voice communication,2014,"In a previous study, we developed an embodied virtual communication system for human interaction analysis by synthesis in avatar-mediated communication and confirmed the close relationship between speech overlap and the period for activating embodied interaction and communication through avatars. In this paper, we propose an interaction-activated communication model based on the heat conduction equation in heat-transfer engineering for enhancing empathy between a human and a robot during embodied interaction in avatar-mediated communication. Further, we perform an evaluation experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in estimating the period of interaction-activated communication in avatar-mediated communication. Results suggest that the proposed model is effective in estimating interaction-activated communication."
1733284,15514,65,Exploring inter- and intra-speaker variability in multi-modal task descriptions,2014,"In natural human-human task descriptions, the verbal and the non-verbal parts of communication together comprise the information necessary for understanding. When robots are to learn tasks from humans in the future, the detection and integrated interpretation of both of these cues is decisive. In the present paper, we present a qualitative study on essential verbal and non-verbal cues by means of which information is transmitted during explaining and showing a task to a learner. In order to collect a respective data set for further investigation, 16 (human) teachers explained to a human learner how to mount a tube in a box with holdings, and six teachers did this to a robot learner. Detailed multi-modal analysis revealed that in both conditions, information was more reliable when transmitted via verbal and gestural references to the visual scene and via eye gaze than via the actual wording. In particular, intra-speaker variability in wording and perspective taking by the teacher potentially hinders understanding of the learner. The results presented in this paper emphasize the importance of investigating the inherently multi-modal nature of how humans structure and transmit information in order to derive respective computational models for robot learners."
1665590,15514,65,Screen feedback: How to overcome the expressive limitations of a social robot,2013,"It is the aim of this work to research how short-comings of a social robot due to its expressive limitations may be overcome by multimodal feedback. An experiment is proposed in which a robot that cannot produce facial expressions plays a game of rock, paper, scissors with people. A screen which is built-in the torso of the robot is used to compensate for these limitations in expressiveness and provide the participant with facial expressions during the game. To assess the impact of the screen on the user's rating of the robot and the interaction as such, there will be a control condition in which the screen will stay turned off. With this experiment we would like to show that sophisticated feedback setup can contribute to make a playful interaction between a human and a robot even more enjoyable."
2335469,15514,65,Estimating an operator's cognitive state in real time: A user modeling approach,2012,"This paper presents a Cognitive Task Load (CTL) model designed to keep track of an operator's mental workload, both quantitatively (amount of workload) and qualitatively (cognitive state). Every second, the CTL-model updates a diagnosis of the operator's cognitive state; by integrating this model in a (semi-)autonomous robot, the robot's level of automation and user interface can be attuned to the operator's state. The CTL-model's predictions were tested in an Urban Search And Rescue (USAR) setting. The test showed insufficient workload variations to validate the model. This indicates that participants should be subjected to more “high-pressure” conditions in future trials. These results also suggest that in a realistic environment, an operator's mental workload is affected by high-level coping strategies."
1242949,15514,65,How to train your DragonBot: Socially assistive robots for teaching children about nutrition through play,2014,"This paper describes an extended (6-session) interaction between an ethnically and geographically diverse group of 26 first-grade children and the DragonBot robot in the context of learning about healthy food choices. We find that children demonstrate a high level of enjoyment when interacting with the robot, and a statistically significant increase in engagement with the system over the duration of the interaction. We also find evidence of relationship-building between the child and robot, and encouraging trends towards child learning. These results are promising for the use of socially assistive robotic technologies for long-term one-on-one educational interventions for younger children."
1741092,15514,65,Adaptive choreography for user's preferences on personal robots,2012,"We propose an approach to efficiently adapt the non-verbal information of personal robots to a user's preferences. As non-verbal information focuses on gestures except meaningful gestures, in our method the adaptation problem is formalized as choreography; the action (as one unit of the non-verbal information) is assigned to each state as preferred by the user. Since the state is defined based on the classification of language focusing on the shallow discourse structure proposed by [1], our method is constructed with independence of tasks and situations unlike previous methods. Furthermore, using a preferences database obtained from multiple users, we produce a User Preference Model (UPM) that can represent various user preferences by a small number of parameters. A new user is asked to assign actions on a few states to adapt the UPM for the user preference. After the adaptation, the UPM can be used to predict actions on other states as preferred by the user, that accomplishes adaptive choreography. We implemented the proposed method with a personal robot, and validated it through experiments on multiple tasks with human subjects. As a result, we confirmed that the user's impressions of the robot were greatly improved by our method for multiple tasks."
1392543,15514,65,Eye blink detection using monocular system and its applications,2012,"In this paper, we propose a practical method for eye blink detection using a monocular system. Eye blink detection is an important technology in many situations such as facial action analysis and signal processing. However, automatic eye blink detection is quite difficult since the eye blink is occurred fast. Fast head tracking and eye detection methods are therefore required in real environment. The proposed method is based on the facial feature point tracking algorithm by using particle filtering. The proposed method works at over 60fps and is able to detect accurate blink motion in real time although our system require only one USB camera. In order to confirm the effectiveness, we show some of applications using our blink detection system."
1330674,15514,65,A public domain dataset for ADL recognition using wrist-placed accelerometers,2014,"The automatic monitoring of specific Activities of Daily Living (ADL) can be a useful tool for Human-Robot Interaction in smart environments and Assistive Robotics applications. The qualitative definition that is given for most ADL and the lack of well-defined benchmarks, however, are obstacles toward the identification of the most effective monitoring approaches for different tasks. The contribution of the article is two-fold: (i) we propose a taxonomy of ADL allowing for their categorization with respect to the most suitable monitoring approach; (ii) we present a freely available dataset of acceleration data, coming from a wrist-worn wearable device, targeting the recognition of 14 different human activities."
1138202,15514,65,Multi-view operator control unit to improve situation awareness in USAR missions,2012,"In urban search and rescue (USAR) missions, manually controlling robots is difficult, in large part due to low situation awareness (SA) provided by operator control units (OCUs). This paper looks at state-of-the-art OCUs to identify seven fundamental problems to be resolved. Next, the design and implementation of a multi-view multi-modal OCU are presented. This OCU follows a large set of design guidlines and also features novel techniques for a human operator to remotely interact with a man-portable ground robot. The system was evaluated in a high fidelity tunnel accident simulation at a fire fighting training center. The OCU allowed training and collisions to remain low, while SA was improved. Qualitative observations are also discussed, such that end-users do not often choose the optimal views in the OCU for the tasks at hand."
1477128,15514,65,Object texture recognition by dynamic tactile sensing using active exploration,2012,"For both humans and robots, tactile sensing is important for interaction with the environment: it is the core sensing used for exploration and manipulation of objects. In this paper, we present a method for determining object texture by active exploration with a robotic fingertip equipped with a dynamic tactile transducer based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric film. Different test surfaces are actively explored and the signal from the sensor is used for feature extraction, which is subsequently used for classification. A comparison between the significance of different extracted features and performance of learning algorithms is done and the best method is further used to classify objects by their surface textures with recognition results higher than 90 percent."
2648775,15514,65,Remixing playware,2014,"In this paper, we describe the concept of remixing playware, which allows sampling and remixing of both physical and functional (e.g. music content) aspects of a system. Such remixing playware has a number of distinguished features which are explained in the paper: user-configurable modularity, which allows the user to interact and manipulate with samples; user-guided behavior-based system, which allows music compositions to emerge from the way performer interacts with the instruments that provide the primitive behaviours; intelligent sampling as the ability of creating samples that allow anybody to remix with the samples ensuring an engaging outcome. The paper exemplifies remixing playware with a variety of implementations in RoboMusic concerts, the virtual MusicTiles app, the physical MagicCubes, the physical dices in Peter Gabriel concerts, and the S'n'S system. These examples focus on music creation and performance, based upon the concept of RoboMusic, and it is argued that the concept of remixing playware extends to many other application areas of playware."
2238452,15514,65,A superimposed self-character mediated video chat system with the function of face-to-face projection based on talker's face direction,2013,"We previously proposed an embodied video communication system called “E-VChat,” in which a CG avatar is superimposed on the other talker's video image in a face-to-face scene, so that they can better comprehend their mutual interaction during remote communication. Remote talkers can then communicate interactively, via their own avatar, with the partner's video image, which moves based on the talker's motion, and which automatically generates motion based on the on-off pattern of the talker's voice. In its practical use for video communication, images of the talkers are taken from various viewpoints around the monitor. In our previous system, however, the talker's self-character is placed at the bottom center of the partner's image, irrespective of the partner's angle. In this paper, we examine the effects of a virtual face-to-face projection based on the talker's face angles and of the selection of the talker's avatar character in this E-VChat system for enhanced avatar-mediated communication. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a self-avatar that uses the talker's head motion and auto-generated motion based on speech input through a communication experiment in which 12 pairs of subjects are evaluated. In addition, through a communication experiment, we confirm the effectiveness of the superimposed avatar for a face-to-face floating projection based on the partner's face angle, as compared to bottom-center projection of the partner's image, irrespective of the partner's angle."
1349803,15514,65,E-VChat: A video communication system in which a speech-driven embodied entrainment character working with head motion is superimposed for a virtual face-to-face scene,2012,"We developed an embodied video communication system in which a human-type avatar called “VirtualActor,” engaging in interactive behavior, was superimposed on the other speech partner's video image in a virtual face-to-face scene. The system posed some problems for VirtualActor such as a sense of restraint owing to sensor cables and the sensors' lack of portability. In this paper, we propose the concept of an embodied video communication system in which a CG character is superimposed on the other talker's video image in a face-to-face scenario, and we develop a prototype called “E-VChat,”. This system has a CG character, which moves on the basis of the talker's head motions with a motion-capture device and automatically generates motions on the basis of the talker's voice. Furthermore, we propose a multiple-character system in which CG characters crowd around the other talker virtually, and we develop the prototype system. These characters enhance human communication by facilitating interactive behavior on the basis of the talker's voice. An interview-style communication experiment is performed to confirm the effectiveness of the E-VChat system for 12 pairs of subjects using three communication modes: “only the other talker's image,” “the other talker's image with the talker's avatar,” and “the other talker's image with the talker's avatar and character audience.” The results show that all communication modes are positively assessed by sensory evaluation and that the other talker's image with talker's avatar and character audience mode is evaluated highly in paired comparison."
1594557,15514,65,An experiment of low cost entertainment robotics,2013,"This paper reports about the robotic installation set up by the Rhoban Project in the French pavilion of the Expo 2012 of Yeosu, Korea ([6]). The installation has consisted in a humorous show involving humanoid robots and anthropomorphic arms, with the illusion of life as a guideline. We emphasized natural compliant motion and physical interaction in order to make the show attractive. The design raised some issues dealing with robustness of robots, but also with the realism of the motions and the synchronization of the robots with the music."
1544487,15514,65,ArCo: An architecture for children to control a set of robots,2012,"This article presents ArCo which is an architecture for managing a digital environment in a context of ambient intelligence. ArCo can integrate all kinds of objects and is totally configurable. Moreover it proposes a visual programming interface, AmbiProg, which allows controlling each digital object which composes an environment. The objective of this paper is to appraise AmbiProg. An experiment was realized with 16 children around 10 years old. They were asked to realize exercises in a limited period of time. The objective was to determine if programming was easy and how many times they needed to learn scenarios creation. It appeared that they succeed tasks and were able to use AmbiProg. Programming an environment was easy as pie."
2203884,15514,65,The difference of user's impression between an intelligent medicine case and a home interface robot,2011,"In advanced countries like Japan, the number of elderly recipients who take medicine every day has been increasing due to the aging of the population. Since they have many risks of inappropriate medication (e.g. overdose), we have developed an intelligent medicine case named iMec in order to assist caregivers in monitoring. In addition, we will help a recipient directly by using a display and a speaker embedded in the medicine case. Meanwhile, an interface robot which communicated with complex house appliances has been developed to provide a variety of services. Therefore, we consider how the recipient should be supported by the medicine case and the interface robot in the house. In this paper, we set up an experimental environment and research the difference of recipient's impression between the medicine case and the interface robot. As a result, we confirm that the interface robot is more effective in self-medication support than the medicine case because a recipient is apt to listen to the friendly robot."
1394426,15514,65,A fundamental study on synchronous dance movements between two dancers in face-to-face,2012,"This study uses a motion capture system and focuses on up-down dance movements in order to investigate how dancers communicate and interact with each other. In two different experiments, we asked if there were differences in the synchronization of timing, knee height and knee angle, as well as in the correlation of velocities between dance partners (1) when they danced face-to-face versus face-to-back, and (2) when one dancer maintained a constant rhythm as opposed to a variable rhythm. The results of Experiment 1 indicated that timing differences were smaller when a synchronous task was performed face-to-face, and that the cross-correlations of velocities were higher as compared to when the task was performed face-to-back. In both face-to-face and face-to-back conditions, knee height and angle were nearly identical in the two dancers in the synchronous task, whereas the angular variability was found to be smaller in the face-to-face condition. The results of Experiment 2 showed that timing differences were smaller and cross-correlations were higher in the synchronous, variable rhythm condition than in the asynchronous task, whereas knee height and angles did not differ in the synchronous task. This indicated that timing differences decreased when the dancers could see each other, and that they were able to synchronize with each other regardless of changes in rhythm."
2015254,15514,65,Generating connection events for human-robot collaboration,2011,"We have developed and tested a reusable Robot Operating System (ROS) module that supports engagement between a human and a humanoid robot by generating appropriate directed gaze, mutual facial gaze, adjacency pair and backchannel connection events. The module implements policies for adding gaze and pointing gestures to referring phrases (including deictic and anaphoric references), performing end-of-turn gazes, responding to human-initiated connection events and maintaining engagement. The module also provides an abstract interface for receiving information from a collaboration manager using the Behavior Markup Language (BML) and exchanges information with our previously developed engagement recognition module."
1304721,15514,65,Adaptive Category Mapping Networks for all-mode topological feature learning used for mobile robot vision,2014,"This paper presents an adaptive and incremental learning method to visualize series data on a category map. We designate this method as Adaptive Category Mapping Networks (ACMNs). The architecture of ACMNs comprises three modules: a codebook module, a labeling module, and a mapping module. The codebook module converts input features into codebooks as low-dimensional vectors using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). The labeling module creates labels as a candidate of categories based on the incremental learning of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART). The mapping module visualizes spatial relations among categories on a category map using Counter Propagation Networks (CPNs). ACMNs actualize supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning as all-mode learning to switch network structures including connections. The experimentally obtained results obtained using two open datasets reveal that the recognition accuracy of our method is superior to that of the former method. Moreover, we address applications of the visualizing function using category maps."
962996,15514,65,Developing a baseline for upper-body motor skill assessment using a robotic kinematic model,2014,"In the rehabilitation field, determining the effectiveness of an intervention protocol begins by comparing the individual's movement characteristics against a baseline. In most settings, this baseline is determined through clinical studies involving a range of patients belonging to the same demographic group. Unfortunately, this leads to a process that is difficult to repeat for all patient demographics, or all movement characteristics, given the demands on clinicians' and patients' time for performing such clinical baseline measurement studies. To address this issue, we discuss a method that allows clinicians to objectively assess an individual's movements and compare the resulting outcome kinematic metrics to a kinematic baseline. Instead of collecting human patient data, we propose a robotic kinematic model that generates a baseline for different kinematic parameters in real-time as a function of the state of a given task. We evaluate our methodology on elbow and shoulder range of motion (ROM) angles obtained from eleven typically developing children. We compare the user's ROM angles to those generated by the proposed model, and discuss the potential of the model to be used in various intervention protocols."
1678062,15514,65,"Applying affective feedback to reinforcement learning in ZOEI, a comic humanoid robot",2014,"As robotic technologies of varying shapes and forms continue to make their way into our everyday lives, the significance of a humanoid robot's ability to make a human interaction feel natural, engaging and entertaining becomes an area of keen interest in sociable robotics. In this paper, we present our findings on how affective feedback can be used to drive reinforcement learning in human-robot interactions (HRI) and other dialogue systems. We implemented a system where a humanoid robot, named ZOEI, acts as a standup comedian by entertaining a human audience in a bid to generate humor and positively influence the emotional state of the humans. The mood rating of the audience is recorded prior to the interaction session. Using a survey, the eventual emotional state of the human participant is captured after the HRI session. For each audience member, we capture feedback regarding how funny each joke was. We present the implementation of the content selection framework. We share our findings to substantiate the idea that by using expressive behaviors of the humanoid to influence the delivery of content (in this case, jokes) as well as employing reinforcement learning techniques for driving targeted content selection, the robot was able to improve the human mood score progressively across the 16 people who engaged in the study."
1968558,15514,65,Context-aware Bayesian intention estimator using Self-Organizing Map and Petri net,2011,"For intelligent human-machine systems supporting user's operation, prediction of the user behavior and estimation of one's operational intention are required. However, the same high abilities as human being are required for such intelligent machines since human decides own action using advanced complex recognition ability. Therefore, the present authors proposed a Bayesian intention estimator using Self-Organizing Map (SOM). This estimator utilizes a mapping-relation obtained using SOM to find transition of the intentions. In this paper, an improvement of the Bayesian intention estimator is reported by considering the task context. The scenario of whole task is modeled by Petri net, and prediction of belief in Bayesian computation is modified by other probability estimated from the Petri-Net scenario. Applying the presented method to an estimation problem using a remote operation of the radio controlled construction equipments, improvements of the estimator were confirmed; an undetected intention modes were correctly detected, and inadequate identification was corrected with adequate timing."
2412770,15514,65,Generating anticipation in robot motion,2011,"Robots that display anticipatory motion provide their human partners with greater time to respond in interactive tasks because human partners are aware of robot intent earlier. We create anticipatory motion autonomously from a single motion exemplar by extracting hand and body symbols that communicate motion intent and moving them earlier in the motion. We validate that our algorithm extracts the most salient frame (i.e. the correct symbol) which is the most informative about motion intent to human observers. Furthermore, we show that anticipatory variants allow humans to discern motion intent sooner than motions without anticipation, and that humans are able to reliably predict motion intent prior to the symbol frame when motion is anticipatory. Finally, we quantified the time range for robot motion when humans can perceive intent more accurately and the collaborative social benefits of anticipatory motion are greatest."
2162620,15514,65,Modeling and composing gestures for human-robot interaction,2012,"We formalize the representation of gestures and present a model that is capable of synchronizing expressive and relevant gestures with text-to-speech input. A gesture consists of gesture primitives that are executed simultaneously. We formally define the gesture primitive and introduce the concept of a spatially targeted gesture primitive, i.e., a gesture primitive that is directed at a target of interest. The spatially targeted gesture primitive is useful for situations where the direction of the gesture is important for meaningful human-robot interaction. We contribute an algorithm to determine how a spatially targeted gesture primitive is generated. We also contribute a process to analyze the input text, determine relevant gesture primitives from the input text, compose gestures from gesture primitives and rank the combinations of gestures. We propose a set of criteria that weights and ranks the combinations of gestures. Although we illustrate the utility of our model, algorithm and process using a NAO humanoid robot, our contributions are applicable to other robots."
1428976,15514,65,Assessment of robot guidance modalities conveying instructions to humans in emergency situations,2014,"Motivated by the desire to mitigate human casualties in emergency situations, this paper explores various guidance modalities provided by a robotic platform for instructing humans to safely evacuate during an emergency. We focus on physical modifications of the robot, which enables visual guidance instructions, since auditory guidance instructions pose potential problems in a noisy emergency environment. Robotic platforms can convey visual guidance instructions through motion, static signs, dynamic signs, and gestures using single or multiple arms. In this paper, we discuss the different guidance modalities instantiated by different physical platform constructs and assess the abilities of the platforms to convey information related to evacuation. Human-robot interaction studies with 192 participants show that participants were able to understand the information conveyed by the various robotic constructs in 75.8% of cases when using dynamic signs with multi-arm gestures, as opposed to 18.0% when using static signs for visual guidance. Of interest to note is that dynamic signs had equivalent performance to single-arm gestures overall but drastically different performances at the two distance levels tested. Based on these studies, we conclude that dynamic signs are important for information conveyance when the robot is in close proximity to the human but multi-arm gestures are necessary when information must be conveyed across a greater distance."
2146879,15514,65,Improving aspects of empathy and subjective performance for HRI through mirroring facial expressions,2011,"In this paper, the impact of facial expressions on HRI is explored. To determine their influence on empathy of a human towards a robot and perceived subjective performance, an experimental setup is created, in which participants engage in a dialog with the robot head EDDIE. The web-based gaming application “Akinator” serves as a backbone for the dialog structure. In this game, the robot tries to guess a thought-of person chosen by the human by asking various questions about the person. In our experimental evaluation, the robot reacts in various ways to the human's facial expressions, either ignoring them, mirroring them, or displaying its own facial expression based on a psychological model for social awareness. In which way this robot behavior influences human perception of the interaction is investigated by a questionnaire. Our results support the hypothesis that the robot behavior during interaction heavily influences the extent of empathy by a human towards a robot and perceived subjective task-performance, with the adaptive modes clearly leading compared to the non-adaptive mode."
1145736,15514,65,A framework for endowing an interactive robot with reasoning capabilities about perspective-taking and belief management,2014,"In daily human interactions, spatial reasoning occupies an important place. In this paper we present a situation assessment reasoner that generates relevant symbolic information from the geometry of the environment with respect to relations between objects and human capabilities. The role of SPARK (SPAtial Reasoning and Knowledge) component is to permanently maintain a state of the world in order to provide a basis for the robot to plan, to act, to react and to interact. More precisely, we describe here the way the system manages the hypotheses to be able to handle such knowledge in a flexible manner. Equipped with such capabilities, a robot that will interact with humans should be able to extract, compute or infer these relations and capabilities in order to communicate and interact efficiently in a natural way. To illustrate our work, we will explain how the robot is able to manage and update agents beliefs and pass Sally-Anne test. This work is part of a broader effort to develop a complete decisional framework for human-robot interactive task achievement."
1288451,15514,65,Temporal processing on audiovisual simultaneity during perception of apparent motion,2014,"The relation between visual motion information and temporal perception has a significant effect on the development of man-machine interface. However, the relation is still not fully understood. This study aims to investigate temporal processing of audiovisual simultaneity during perception of apparent motion, which is the fundamental unit of human motion perception. Participants performed an audiovisual temporal order judgment (TOJ) task under two conditions: apparent motion condition and non-apparent motion condition. Our result shows that visual motion information contributes to the acceleration of visual processing and the increase of temporal resolution in temporal processing of audiovisual simultaneity. Our findings will provide useful information to construct the frame of temporal processing in man-machine interface."
1147702,15514,65,Walking patterns for real time path planning simulation of humanoids,2012,"We present here a detailed description of the walking algorithm that was designed for 3D simulation of locomotion and path planning of humanoid robots. The walking patterns described were implemented on NAO humanoid models that are used in the 3D simulation league of RoboCup to play soccer. The locomotion algorithm is based on the well known 3D-LIP model that consists of defining walking primitives of the center of mass, keeping its height constant and assuming no torque at the support foot. This paper proposes to detail how to connect the walking primitives, especially at the start of the walk. The second added value of this work resides in the rotation walking primitives that are generated differently from the linear translation walking primitives. This enables the robot to achieve fast rotation on the spot or about a center located on the longitudinal axis. The paper also addresses the issue of re-entrance, i.e. how to take into account a new walking request in real time without waiting for the end of the current walk."
936043,15514,65,AOA: Ambient obstacle avoidance interface,2014,"In this paper, we present a novel interface for teleoperating ground vehicles. Obstacle avoidance with ground vehicles demands a high level of operator attention, typically distracting from the primary mission. The Ambient Obstacle Avoidance (AOA) was designed to allow operators to effectively perform a primary task, such as search, while still effectively avoiding obstacles. The AOA wraps around a standard video interface and provides range information without requiring a separate screen. AOA combines and reduces different data streams into proportionately scaled symbology that directly shows important relationships between vehicle width, vehicle orientation and obstacles in the environment. The use of the AOA interface was tested in both simulation and on physical robots. Results from both tests show an improvement in obstacle avoidance during navigation with the AOA. In addition, results from the simulation test indicate that operators using AOA were able to leverage ambient vision such that the primary visual task was not impeded."
2024331,15514,65,Emotional factors in robot-based assistive services for elderly at home,2013,"Emotional factors related to aging at home assistive technology are known to affect technology acceptance, effective use, and quality of life improvement. This paper is a survey on the affective dimension of robot-based systems conceived for helping elderly at home. The specificity of elders' capabilities (e.g. sensory and cognitive), coping styles, aspirations, lifestyles, social rules and preferences are faced with available knowledge from the fields of social psychology, sociology and gerontology. In the case of social robots, convenient verbal and non-verbal communication and motion behavior (e.g. social distance, space formations) are to be designed according to generational and cultural rules. Moreover, robot behavior should be congruent with its role (i.e. helper, companion) and affordances."
1622148,15514,65,Web-based vs. controled environment: About the reliability of stimuli ratings in human-robot interaction,2013,"In several research areas, e.g. in the field of human-robot interaction, ratings or questionnaires are applied using offline and online methods. An argument for the use of online methods is the efficiency. By using the Internet, data can be collected much faster than in an offline experiment and the administration effort is very low. The goal of our study was to find out, if there is a difference in accuracy between an online and an offline rating task of human and robot emotional facial expressions. Results indicate, that emotional expressions are best recognized in humans (versus robots) and in the offline (versus online) condition. Furthermore, the influence of the emotional category on the accuracy rate varies between conditions. Therefore, we discuss environmental factors of online experiments that are difficult to control as main reasons for these results. We conclude that online rating studies should always be combined with more reliable offline evaluations."
1494242,15514,65,Experience of using a haptic interface to follow a robot without visual feedback,2014,"Search and rescue operations are often undertaken in smoke filled and noisy environments in which rescue teams must rely on haptic feedback for navigation and safe exit. In this paper, we discuss designing and evaluating a haptic interface to enable a human being to follow a robot through an environment with no-visibility. We first discuss the considerations that have led to our current interface design. The second part of the paper describes our testing procedure and the results of our first tests. Based on these results we discuss future improvements of our design."
1370161,15514,65,2D spherical spaces for objects recognition under harsh lighting conditions,2012,"For an object recognition task in an unknown environment, we propose a novel approach for illumination recovery of surface with cast shadows and specularities by using the object spherical spaces properties. Robust objects recognition in complex environment is fundamental to robot intelligence and manipulation. The proposed method is done for reducing the illumination effects on the objects detection and recognition processes. In this work, objects reference images are regenerated to match the scene lighting environment to increase the success rate of the recognition process. First, a database is generated by computing the albedo and surface normals from captured 2D images of the target objects. Next, the scene lighting direction and illumination coefficients are estimated. Finally, by using the calculated spherical spaces properties we regenerate objects reference data to match the search area illumination condition. In this work, practical real time processing speed and small image size were considered when designing the framework. In contrast to other techniques, our work requires no 3D models for the objects training process and takes images from a single camera as an input. Using our proposed 2D Spherical Spaces experimentally showed noticeable improvements in an objects identification task performed by an autonomous robot in a harshly illuminated environment."
1752103,15514,65,"‘Hey robot, please step back!’ - exploration of a spatial threshold of comfort for human-mechanoid spatial interaction in a hallway scenario",2014,"Within the scope of the current research the goal was to develop an autonomous transport assistant for hospitals. As a sort of social robots, they need to fulfill two main requirements with respect to their interactive behavior with humans: (1) a high level of safety and (2) a behavior that is perceived as socially proper. One important element includes the characteristics of movement. However, state-of-the-art hospital robots rather focus on safe but not smart maneuvering. Vital motion parameters in human everyday environment are personal space and velocity. The relevance of these parameters has also been reported in existing human-robot interaction research. However, to date, no minimal accepted frontal and lateral distances for human-mechanoid proxemics have been explored. The present work attempts to gain insights into a potential threshold of comfort and additionally, aims to explore a potential interaction of this threshold and the mechanoid's velocity. Therefore, a user study putting the users in control of the mechanoid was conducted in a laboratory hallway-like setting. Findings align with previously reported personal space zones in human-robot interaction research. Minimal accepted frontal and lateral distances were obtained. Furthermore, insights into a potential categorization of the lateral personal space area around a human are discussed for human-robot interaction."
1819559,15514,65,Informative census transform for very low-resolution image representation,2014,"Our paper newly presents unsupervised feature representation method for very low-resolution (VLR) images called informative census transform (ICT) based on statistical analysis of CT binary features and submodular optimization. A new cost function is designed to measure the informativeness of each binary feature: (1) an individual informativeness of features to represent unlabeled image dataset and (2) relative informativeness between binary features to represent different binary features. Therefore, we considered informativeness of binary feature according to two relationship (1) between feature space and image space, and (2) between different features within same feature space. Moreover, two constraints are designed by considering sub-modular characteristics to guarantee theoretical performance and fast optimization via simple greedy algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed ICT features with two constraints outperforms the traditional CT features in terms of recognition performance and computational cost at VLR problem."
970185,15514,65,Steering a robot with a brain-computer interface: Impact of video feedback on BCI performance,2012,We present an experiment we carried out to determine the influence of the video feedback on the braincomputer interface performance of a system we designed to steer a humanoid robot. The interface is based on the wellknown steady-state visually evoked potentials and the stimuli are integrated into the live feedback from the robot's embedded camera. Five users controlled the HRP-2 humanoid in an experiment designed to measure the performance of the intentions' recognition system. A novel approach in the training phase is also experimented to understand and compensate performance loss due to the dynamic nature of the video feedback of the robot during walking motions. It results that this feedback induces a performance loss; we propose an effective solution to overcome this problem. The detailed results of these experiments are reported in this paper and we discuss the possible causes of performance loss under such conditions.
1280233,15514,65,Development of emotional attachment on a cleaning robot for the long-term interactive affective companion,2013,"Emotional interaction has been widely applied to many robotic applications. Emotional behavior, which is complementary to limited cognitive ability in a service robot, is becoming the attractive service task even including its own therapeutic functions. This paper focused on the user study of an interactive affective companion by using a cleaning robot as a pet. The cognitive and emotional subsumption model is designed for the robust behavior selection with the response to human's commands. In addition, we testified the appropriateness of long-term interaction through tablet-based modality."
2288351,15514,65,Histogram based classification of tactile patterns on periodically distributed skin sensors for a humanoid robot,2011,"The main target of this work is to improve human-robot interaction capabilities, by adding a new modality of sense, touch, to KASPAR, a humanoid robot. Large scale distributed skin-like sensors are designed and integrated on the robot, covering KASPAR at various locations. One of the challenges is to classify different types of touch. Unlike digital images represented by grids of pixels, the geometrical structure of the sensor array limits the capability of straightforward application of well-established approaches for image patterns. This paper introduces a novel histogram-based classification algorithm, transforming tactile data into histograms of local features termed as codebook. Tactile pattern can be invariant at periodical locations, allowing tactile pattern classification using a smaller number of training data, instead of using training data from everywhere on the large scale skin sensors. To generate the codebook, this method uses a two-layer approach, namely local neighbourhood structures and encodings of pressure distribution of the local neighbourhood. Classification is performed based on the constructed features using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the intersection kernel. Real experimental data are used for experiment to classify different patterns and have shown promising accuracy. To evaluate the performance, it is also compared with the SVM using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and results are discussed from both aspects of accuracy and the location invariance property."
1726613,15514,65,The Sixth-Finger: A modular extra-finger to enhance human hand capabilities,2014,"Robotic prosthesis are usually intended as artificial device extensions replacing a missing part of a human body. A new approach regarding robotic limbs is presented here. A modular robot is used not only for replacing a missing part of the body but also as an extra-limb in order to enhance manipulation dexterity and enlarge the workspace of human beings. In this work, the model and control of an additional finger, the Sixth-Finger, is presented as a case study of this type of robotic limbs. The robotic finger has been placed on the wrist opposite to the hand palm. This solution allows to enlarge the hand workspace, increasing the grasp capability of the user. An object-based mapping algorithm is proposed to control the robotic extra-finger by interpreting the whole hand motion in grasping action. A four DoFs modular prototype is presented along with numerical simulations and real experiments. The proposed Sixth-Finger can lead to a wide range of applications in the direction of augmenting human capabilities through wearable robotics."
2034812,15514,65,Situation assessment for human-robot interactive object manipulation,2011,"In daily human interactions spatial reasoning occupies an important place. With this ability we can build relations between objects and people, and we can predict the capabilities and the knowledge of the people around us. An interactive robot is also expected to have these abilities in order to establish an efficient and natural interaction. In this paper we present a situation assessment reasoner, based on spatial reasoning and perspective taking, which generates on-line relations between objects and agents in the environment. Being fully integrated to a complete architecture, this reasoner sends the generated symbolic knowledge to a fact data base which is built on the basis on an ontology and which is accessible to the entire system. This work is also part of a broader effort to develop a complete decisional framework for human-robot interactive task achievement."
1516863,15514,65,Trigger pattern detection method for assisting in ambulation rehabilitation based on EEG analysis,2012,"This paper proposes a method to detect the trigger pattern of walking motion from an electroencephalogram (EEG). Our final goal is to develop a rehabilitation assistance system that can assist in ambulation exercise and be used on a daily basis by watching for the patient's degree of functional recovery. Due to assist in ambulation rehabilitation, it needs to detect the feature signal related to the voluntary walking. As a first step, we detected an EEG feature pattern that has the potential to become the starting point of walking motion. The proposed method involves EEG recording, noise reduction, and EEG pattern classification. The EEG device had dry-type sensors and several electrodes with a headphone. Morphological filters were used to reduce EEG noise. The EEG patterns related to walking motion were classified using a support vector machine. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments using real EEG data."
1269488,15514,65,Mood expression through parameterized functional behavior of robots,2013,"Bodily expression of affect is crucial to human robot interaction. We distinguish between emotion and mood expression, and focus on mood expression. Bodily expression of an emotion is explicit behavior that typically interrupts ongoing functional behavior. Instead, bodily mood expression is integrated with functional behaviors without interrupting them. We propose a parameterized behavior model with specific behavior parameters for bodily mood expression. Robot mood controls pose and motion parameters, while those parameters modulate behavior appearance. We applied the model to two concrete behaviors - waving and pointing - of the NAO robot, and conducted a user study in which participants (N=24) were asked to design the expression of positive, neutral, and negative moods by modulating the parameters of the two behaviors. Results show that participants created different parameter settings corresponding with different moods, and the settings were generally consistent across participants. Various parameter settings were also found to be behavior-invariant. These findings suggest that our model and parameter set are promising for expressing moods in a variety of behaviors."
1211306,15514,65,A maneuverable robotic wheelchair able to move adaptively with a caregiver by considering the situation,2013,"Although it is desirable for wheelchair users to move alone by operating wheelchairs themselves, they are often pushed or accompanied by caregivers, especially in elderly care facilities. In designing robotic wheelchairs, therefore, it is important to consider how to reduce the caregiver's load and support their activities. We particularly focus on communication among wheelchair users and caregivers because face-to-face communication is known to be effective in ameliorating elderly mental health issues. Hence, we propose a maneuverable robotic wheelchair that can move autonomously towards a goal while considering the situation of the accompanying caregiver. Our robotic wheelchair starts to move autonomously towards the goal as soon as the caregiver sets the goal position, such as a bathroom, by utilizing its touch panel interface. While moving towards the goal, the robotic wheelchair autonomously controls its speed and direction of movement to facilitate natural communication between the wheelchair user and the caregiver, by observing the situation of the accompanying caregiver."
1890104,15514,65,MOTORE: A mobile haptic interface for neuro-rehabilitation,2011,"The present paper introduces a novel type of haptic interface which is fully portable and employs only onboard sensors and electronics to solve accurate localization and force feedback generation. The device offers 2DOF force control while sliding on a plane and maintaining its orientation comfortable for the user. The device generates force feedback information without any intermediate link between the motion wheels and the grasping handle. The device has been designed for application in neuro-rehabilitation protocols and it adopts specific mechanical, electrical and control solutions in order to cope with patient requirements. The paper describes the mechanical and electronic solutions as well as the most relevant features of control implementation issues that were addressed in the system design."
2031359,15514,65,A friendly gesture: Investigating the effect of multimodal robot behavior in human-robot interaction,2011,"Gesture is an important feature of social interaction, frequently used by human speakers to illustrate what speech alone cannot provide, e.g. to convey referential, spatial or iconic information. Accordingly, humanoid robots that are intended to engage in natural human-robot interaction should produce speech-accompanying gestures for comprehensible and believable behavior. But how does a robot's non-verbal behavior influence human evaluation of communication quality and the robot itself? To address this research question we conducted two experimental studies. Using the Honda humanoid robot we investigated how humans perceive various gestural patterns performed by the robot as they interact in a situational context. Our findings suggest that the robot is evaluated more positively when non-verbal behaviors such as hand and arm gestures are displayed along with speech. These findings were found to be enhanced when the participants were explicitly requested to direct their attention towards the robot during the interaction."
1507076,15514,65,Perception systems for naturally interacting humanoid robots,2011,This paper presents a design concept and a exemplary realization of a perception system for naturally interacting humanoid robots. Relevant non-verbal interaction capabilities are selected based on psychological research. These interaction capabilities are transferred into a multi-functional user model which is exemplary implemented for interactive game scenarios. Benefits of this perception system design in comparison to existing realizations are a modular perception concept and the possibility to transfer psychological inter-personal research directly into human-robot interaction scenarios.
1574169,15514,65,Context-sensitive in-the-world interfaces for mobile manipulation robots,2012,"We present an interface that allows users to direct a mobile manipulation robot in tabletop pick-and-place tasks using only their head motions and a single button. The system uses an estimate of the user's head pose and a 3d world model maintained by the robot to determine where the user is pointing their head. We give the results of some preliminary evaluations of our system, which suggest that it is both intuitive and effective. We also describe an example trash-sorting application where the user directs a PR2 robot sort objects in to “trash” and “recycle” piles."
1536140,15514,65,On-road vehicle detection based on effective hypothesis generation,2013,"This paper proposes an effective hypothesis generation for detection multi-vehicle using a monocular camera fixed on the host vehicle. In hypothesis generation (HG) step, we use linear model between the distance and vehicle size by using recursive least square. It generates effective image patches and improves the detection performance. In addition, it also reduces the computation time compared with sliding-window approach. In hypothesis verification (HV) step, we use the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In our experiment, Caltech and IR datasets are used. The experimental result shows the improvement of running time and detection performance."
1473578,15514,65,VT-ware: A wearable tactile device for upper extremity motion guidance,2014,"In this study, we developed and evaluated a tactile stimulation device for upper extremity motion guidance. The developed device stimulates skin pressing directly using “tapping.” A minimal number of actuators are used in the tactile stimulation device that is worn on the wrist. The device consists of six Tiny Ultrasonic Linear Actuator (TULA) modules, a control circuit, an upper case, and a lower case. We estimated motions through kinematic analysis of the upper extremities for motion guidance and our driving algorithm applied a tactile illusion to generate directional information cues and tapped one point using a tactile stimulation device to guide upper extremity motion. To evaluate the developed device, an experiment was conducted to test whether directional information can be successfully displayed by the device. As a result, it was found that the directional information cues could be reliably conveyed through the wrist with tactile stimulation using a “tapping” method that is based on tactile illusion, though the number of actuators that display continuous tactile stimulation is limited."
1840907,15514,422,CHIRP: a new classifier based on composite hypercubes on iterated random projections,2011,"We introduce a classifier based on the L-infinity norm. This classifier, called CHIRP, is an iterative sequence of three stages (projecting, binning, and covering) that are designed to deal with the curse of dimensionality, computational complexity, and nonlinear separability. CHIRP is not a hybrid or modification of existing classifiers; it employs a new covering algorithm. The accuracy of CHIRP on widely-used benchmark datasets exceeds the accuracy of competitors. Its computational complexity is sub-linear in number of instances and number of variables and subquadratic in number of classes."
1444537,15514,65,Development of an intuitive interface based on facial orientations and gazing actions for auto-wheel chair operation,2012,"This paper suggests an intuitive interface based on the facial orientations and gazing actions for auto-wheel chair operation. The real-time image of the operator's face was taken to the computer through the USB camera to observe the operational intention. The changes in the darkness area of the both nostrils were utilized for recognition of the face orientations. When the operator faced to up and downward, the darkness areas of both nostrils were increased and decreased, respectively. On the other hand, the difference between two nostril areas could be caused in cases where the face was turn to the side. Here, these characteristics were utilized for the recognition of the face orientations. Moreover, gazing actions was recognized by the curve ratio of the operator's eye lines. Only when the operator gazed to the control computer, the facial orientation was reflected to operate the auto-wheelchair, instead of a joystick interface."
1119769,15514,65,Accurate eye detection using generalized binary pattern,2013,"This paper proposes the eye detection using generalized binary pattern (GBP). The GBP can generate all possible patterns of ordered comparisons within a 3 × 3 neighborhood. Since existing local structure patterns consider all neighboring pixels around a given pixel, the number of possible patterns is fixed and limited to 2 n . However, since the GBP takes the ordered comparisons of some partial neighboring pixels around a given pixel, a total of 502 different types can be generated in 3 × 3 block. So, our proposed GBP generates 19,162 binary patterns at the given pixel. Among the possible binary patterns, we take an effective set of pattern and position by the AdaBoost feature selection algorithm. Experimental results shows that the GBP provides higher eye detection accuracy on the BioID and FERET databases than other existing local structure patterns such as LBP and MCT."
1669893,15514,65,Emergent emotional and verbal strategies in autism are based on multimodal interactions with toy robots in free spontaneous game play,2013,"Under the hypothesis that multimodal cognitive processes could be though as a building block from which language could emerge in autistic children, we used a toy robot with and without free game play. A range of cognitive nonverbal criteria including eye contact, touching, manipulation, and posture were analyzed; the frequency of the words and verbs was calculated. Only during game play the children interact quasi-continually and multimodally with the robot and express language. A positive correlation exists between expressive language and multimodal cognitive processes only when free game play with the robot is possible. The data suggest that a mobile toy robot could be used as a neural orthesis in order to improve autistic children's brain multimodal activity and incite them to express language."
2209384,15514,65,Multimodal controls for soldier/swarm interaction,2011,"In theory, autonomous robotic swarms can be used for critical Army tasks, including accompanying vehicle convoys to provide security and enhance situational awareness. However, the Soldier providing swarm supervisory control must be able to correct swarm actions, especially in disrupted or degraded conditions. Dynamic map displays are visual interfaces that can be useful for swarm supervisory control tasks, because they can show the spatial positions of objects of interest (e.g., people, robots, swarm members, and vehicles), at different locations (e.g., on roads and intersections), while allowing user commands as well as world changes, often in real time. In this study, multimodal speech and touch controls were designed for a U.S. Army Research Laboratory dynamic map display to allow users to provide supervisory control of a simulated robotic swarm. This experiment explored the use of sequential multimodal touch and speech commands for placement of swarm-related map objects at different map locations. The criterion variable was temporal binding, the time between the onset of each command in the sequence, relative to the system's ability to fuse the two sequential commands into a unitary response. User preference of modality for the first command was also measured. These concepts were tested in a laboratory study using 12 male Marine volunteers with a mean age of 19 years. Results indicated significant differences in temporal binding for different map objects and map locations. Additionally, nine out of 12 Marines used speech commands approximately 75% or more of the time, while the remaining three Marines used touch commands first approximately 75% or more of the time. Temporal binding was significantly shorter for touch-first than for speech-first commands. Suggestions for future research and future applications to robotic command and control systems are described."
2370090,15514,65,Awareness of human's subjective efficiency in collaborative HAI situation,2011,"Our study aims to determine how an agent should be designed to perform cooperative work smoothly. From previous experiments, it has been suggested that a human does not acknowledge an agent as a real participant. We considered how we could confirm the above possibility with a cognitive experiment. We designed an experiment with a game format to determine whether subjects would acknowledge an agent's action and existence if the experimental situation presents mutual purpose and timing of entities. The results of our experiment clearly show that work efficiency improves by the agent's behavior. The results of these experiments will influence the model of Human-Agent Interaction in the future."
1108235,15514,65,Haptic-enabled driving training system,2013,"The objective of the current work is a driving training system to capture and transfer skills from the expert to the novice drivers. The emphasis is on the haptic feedback applied on the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal to improve trainee's performance. For capturing skills, driving signals of an expert driver, performing a given task using a developed driving simulator, are recorded as reference trajectories. For transferring, two different methods are considered: guidance to assist and disturbance to distract following the reference. For evaluation, two performance measures are assumed: trajectory-based and model-based. They are used not only to evaluate the progress of the trainee but also to tune the gain of controllers delivering haptic feedback."
2220327,15514,65,The sharing of meanings of signals through limited media in two-player games,2011,"How can humans come to share the meaning of signals when only very limited media are available and there are no pre-defined meanings to signals? To answer the above question, we designed two-player games, which require the players' cooperation to play. The only communication means are to send color (hue) signals in one game, or monotonic sound signals in another. The player must assign a necessary meaning to an available signal, and send it to the partner. The partner must infer its meaning (sender's intention) and act cooperatively. Using these games, the process of sharing the meaning of signals is investigated, and some interesting common features are found. The process is based on mind-reading of the partner's intention, which is a key ability for any types of human communication. The mechanism is analyzed in the relevance theory framework. Our findings can be used for improving human-agent communication where no pre-defined languages are available."
1594568,15514,65,Developing new frontiers in the Rubber Hand Illusion: Design of an open source robotic hand to better understand prosthetics,2014,"In psychology the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) is an experiment where participants get the feeling that a fake hand is becoming their own. Recently, new testing methods using an action based paradigm have induced stronger RHI. However, these experiments are facing limitations because they are difficult to implement and lack of rigorous experimental conditions. This paper proposes a low-cost open source robotic hand which is easy to manufacture and removes these limitations. This device reproduces fingers movement of the participants in real time. A glove containing sensors is worn by the participant and records fingers flexion. Then a microcontroller drives hobby servo-motors on the robotic hand to reproduce the corresponding fingers position. A connection between the robotic device and a computer can be established, enabling the experimenters to tune precisely the desired parameters using Matlab. Since this is the first time a robotic hand is developed for the RHI, a validation study has been conducted. This study confirms previous results found in the literature. This study also illustrates the fact that the robotic hand can be used to conduct innovative experiments in the RHI field. Understanding such RHI is important because it can provide guidelines for prosthetic design."
1127685,15514,65,Do I remember you? Memory and identity in multiple embodiments,2013,This paper investigates user perceptions of continuous identity as agents migrate between different embodiments. It reports an experiment seeking to establish whether migrating or not migrating the interaction memory of the agent would affect the user's perception of consistent agent identity over different embodiments. The experiment involved a treasure hunt in which a virtual agent migrated from a screen to a mobile phone in order to accompany a user while they searched for clues. A total of 45 subjects took part in three different conditions with 15 subjects in each. The outcome showed that the presence of memory affected the competence users ascribed to the virtual agent. However it had no significant effect on a strong perception of consistent identity across multiple embodiments.
1598076,15514,65,Haptic hand-tremor simulation for enhancing empathy with disabled users,2013,"This paper presents a system designed to induce, in healthy subjects, artificial hand-tremor that is observed in persons affected by neurological impairments. The objective is to allow a healthy user to feel in first person the effect of the impairment while performing common manipulative tasks in order for her/him to understand and gain empathy with the impaired person. The developed tool is based on a wrist-attached desktop haptic interface with a workspace that is comparable to that of the arm of the user. Such device is able to exert controlled forces on the user's wrist and induce hand-tremor whose frequency and amplitude is correlated with different pathologies. The control of the device is based on the recording and playback of tremor signals acquired by a motion tracker. In this paper, we present the system with its dynamic characteristics and three different types of controller are experimentally tested and compared."
1084065,15514,65,Potential human reaction aware mobile robot motion planner: Potential cost minimization framework,2014,"Robots have been stepping steadily into our daily-life. As humans are likely to exist in daily-life scenarios, “human-aware” becomes an essential point for robot navigation in these scenarios. Existing research works on human aware robot navigation rarely take potential human reaction into account in the motion planner. In contrast, we propose in this paper the concept of potential human reaction aware motion planner (PHRAMP), i.e. the robot had better take potential human reaction into account in its motion planning. We propose a general methodology coined as the potential cost minimization (PCM) framework for realizing PHRAMPs. We present some theoretical characteristics of this framework and explain its relationship with existing methods. We describe an instantiation of the PCM framework which serves as a concrete example PHRAMP to demonstrate the utility and advantage of the PCM framework."
1543339,15514,65,Effect of social interaction on Body Ownership Transfer to teleoperated android,2013,"Body Ownership Transfer (BOT) is an illusion that we feel external objects as parts of our own body that occurs when teleoperating android robots. In past studies, we have been investigating under what conditions this illusion occurs. However, past studies were only conducted with simple operation tasks such as by only moving the robot's hand. Does this illusion occur under much complex tasks such as having a conversation? What kind of conversation setting is required to invoke this illusion? In this paper, we examined how factors in social interaction affects occurrence of BOT. Participants had conversation using the teleoperated robot under different situations and teleoperation settings. The results revealed that BOT does occur by the act of having a conversation, and that conversation partner's presence and appropriate responses are necessary for enhancement of BOT."
2221636,15514,65,Bridging the gap between users' expectations and system evaluations,2011,"What users expect of a robot strongly influences their ratings of the interaction. If the robot satisfies the expectations, the users are usually pleased. If not, their experience of the interaction is negative. We as robot designers strive to design for positive interaction experiences. Therefore, users' expectations need to be taken into account. However, in this paper we argue that not all expectations are equally important. Based on a semantic differential questionnaire, we show a correlation between the perceived importance of users' expectations and the difficulty to satisfy them in interaction. The paper argues that this correlation allows to identify the most important improvements that should be made to robot systems but also to find attributes which the robot is quite good at already."

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal to realize embodied and multimodal HRI between virtual robot and real world human in response to the above constraints. Based on our SIGVerse simulator, a 3D virtual environment is established for the virtual robot to interact with real world human via immersive interface. The realizations of embodiment and multimodal interaction are illustrated in several HRI research scenarios, where verbal action instruction and spatial information from the body gesture are simulated."
1215759,15514,65,Conveying emotion in robotic speech: Lessons learned,2014,"This research explored whether robots can use modern speech synthesizers to convey emotion with their speech. We investigated the use of MARY, an open source speech synthesizer, to convey a robot's emotional intent to novice robot users. The first experiment indicated that participants were able to distinguish the intended emotions of anger, calm, fear, and sadness with success rates of 65.9%, 68.9%, 33.3%, and 49.2%, respectively. An issue was the recognition rate of the intended happiness statements, 18.2%, which was below the 20% level determined for chance. The vocal prosody modifications for the expression of happiness were adjusted and the recognition rates for happiness improved to 30.3% in a second experiment. This is an important benchmarking step in a line of research that investigates the use of emotional speech by robots to improve human-robot interaction. Recommendations and lessons learned from this research are presented."
1536991,15514,339,Single round access privacy on outsourced storage,2012,"We present SR-ORAM 1 , the first single-round-trip polylogarithmic time Oblivious RAM that requires only logarithmic client storage. Taking only a single round trip to perform a query, SR-ORAM has an online communication / computation cost of  O (log  n  log log  n ), and an offline, overall amortized per-query communication cost of  O (log 2   n  log log  n ), requiring under 2 round trips. The client folds an entire interactive sequence of Oblivious RAM requests into a single query object that the server can unlock incrementally, to satisfy a query without learning its result. This results in an Oblivious RAM secure against an  actively malicious  adversary, with unprecedented speeds in accessing large data sets over high-latency links. We show this to be the most efficient storage-free-client Oblivious RAM to date for today's Internet-scale network latencies."
1529492,15514,65,Learn to adapt based on users' feedback,2014,"Adaptive and personalized behavior is becoming essential and desirable in Human-Robot Interactive systems. We are interested in adaptive robots that learn from interaction traces (previous interactions with users). Our proposal is based on types of interactions where users express their level of satisfaction through feedback. Indeed, depending on the situation of interaction and the user himself, the robot behavior should adjust, and therefore can be judged, differently. From interaction traces (including robot actions and users' feedback), we aim to extract adaptation rules that give the dependencies between certain attributes of the interaction situation and/or the user profile, and the level of user satisfaction. We propose two learning algorithms to learn these adaptation rules. The first algorithm is direct, certain and optimal but slow to converge. The second is able to detect the importance of certain attributes in the adaptation process. It generalizes adaptation rules on unknown situations and to first time users, which makes it an approach with risk. We detail in this paper, our proposed model, both learning algorithms, and an evaluation of the learned rules from both algorithms by simulations and through a scenario with real users."
1529822,15514,65,Real time modeling of the cognitive load of an Urban Search And Rescue robot operator,2014,"Urban Search And Rescue (USAR) robots are used to find and save victims in the wake of disasters such as earthquakes or terrorist attacks. The operators of these robots are affected by high cognitive load; this hinders effective robot usage. This paper presents a cognitive task load model for real-time monitoring and, subsequently, balancing of workload on three factors that affect operator performance and mental effort: time occupied, level of information processing, and number of task switches. To test an implementation of the model, five participants drove a shape-shifting USAR robot, accumulating over 16 hours of driving time in the course of 485 USAR missions with varying objectives and difficulty. An accuracy of 69% was obtained for discrimination between low and high cognitive load; higher accuracy was measured for discrimination between extreme cognitive loads. This demonstrates that such a model can contribute, in a non-invasive manner, to estimating an operator's cognitive state. Several ways to further improve accuracy are discussed, based on additional experimental results."
2335827,15514,65,Learning actions from human-robot dialogues,2011,"Natural language interactions between humans and robots are currently limited by many factors, most notably by the robot's concept representations and action repertoires. We propose a novel algorithm for learning meanings of action verbs through dialogue-based natural language descriptions. This functionality is deeply integrated in the robot's natural language subsystem and allows it to perform the actions associated with the learned verb meanings right away without any additional help or learning trials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in a scenario where a human explains to a robot the meaning of an action verb unknown to the robot and the robot is subsequently able to carry out the instructions involving this verb."
1200762,15514,65,Feedback guidelines for multimodal human-robot interaction: How should a robot give feedback when asking for directions?,2012,"It is the aim of our research to explore how multimodal feedback can help a robot to carry out itinerary requests effectively and satisfactory for a human interaction partner. We conducted two studies to evaluate the feedback setup of the Interactive Urban Robot (IURO), which navigates through public space autonomously and finds its way by asking pedestrians for directions. In a Wizard-of-Oz (WOz) experiment with novice users, different feedback modalities and various combinations of them were tested against each other to ascertain the ideal setup of the robot. Subsequently, a cognitive walkthrough with HRI experts was performed to validate the results from the experiment. The results from both studies show that for itinerary requests verbal feedback is most prominent but other feedback modalities may support the conversation by providing reassurance or positive emotions."
2166714,15514,65,Collocated interaction with flying robots,2011,"We introduce a socially motivated interaction technique with collocated flying robots (a quadrotor in our current prototype). Instead of the traditional remote interaction controllers often used when interacting with flying robots and UAVs, we explore the collocated interaction space and suggest a direct interaction technique motivated by social human-robot interaction themes. Our approach is inspired by the types of interaction humans have with birds, specifically falconeering, and is facilitated by gestures-based interaction, while the user is within the field of view of the flying robot. This paper outlines our research goals, task examples, and our overall design approach. The paper also discusses our current prototyping efforts, as well as a preliminary evaluation of our approach, performed through two design critiques, studying our collocated interaction technique concept, and its potential, drawbacks and benefits for users."
1704026,15514,65,The mental simulation of a human-robot interaction: Positive effects on attitudes and anxiety toward robots,2012,"In the present study, we experimentally investigated whether the mental simulation of an interaction with the robot NAO would improve human-robot interaction (HRI) acceptance, and would reduce negative attitudes and anxiety toward robots in general. Participants were introduced to the robot NAO and were then instructed to imagine for two minutes either a cooperative or a competitive interaction with the robot or a neutral scenario that did not include an HRI. Our results showed that, independent of its content, imagining contact with NAO improved HRI acceptance. Moreover, after imagining contact with the robot, participants indicated less negative attitudes and less anxiety toward robots in general. These effects were strongest for cooperative imagined contact. Theoretical and practical implications for research on HRI will be discussed."

This controller is based on a multi-objective optimization technique allowing simultaneous achievement of different constraints and goals. The core of the developed algorithm is based on the particle swarm optimization technique (PSO). Through some examples, namely, a wheeled manipulator following human in populated and cluttered environments, and a humanoid robot reaching and tracking objects. we show how the PSO is effective in solving the given problems in flexible and generic ways. We detail in this paper the algorithm and give some results obtained from simulations and field trials."

Reinforcement learning was integrated with this method to make necessary human teaching minimal and it was applied to robotic manipulation in a virtual environment in our previous study. However, the process of online reinforcement learning requires huge computation time. Moreover, the low success rate of reinforcement learning makes the expected time to learning success longer. Thus we accelerate the process of reinforcement learning in this paper to make our proposed method more practical. We also try to improve the success rate of reinforcement learning for further learning acceleration."
1980548,15514,65,Use of angular acceleration and velocity estimates for control of pneumatic-powered wearable motion assist device,2014,"The focus of this paper is to develop a control system for wearable motion assist device giving physical support for people who are doing physically demanding tasks. Two key technical issues in developing such a device are how to generate the reference trajectory for the actuator installed to provide appropriate motion support, and how to determine the strength and duration of assist to help complete current physical task. This paper tackles the use of joint angular acceleration and velocity estimates in the control of motion assist device. How the estimates are generated, how they are used in control and how the control system is organized to achieve performance requirements will be described.

2303401,15514,65,Designing POMDP models of socially situated tasks,2011,"In this paper, a modelling approach is described that represents human-robot social interactions as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). In these POMDPs, the intention of the human is represented as an unobservable part of the state space, and the robot's own intentions are expressed through the rewards. The state transition structure for the models is created using action rules that capture the effects of the robot's actions, relate the human's behavior to their intentions, and describe the changing state of the environment. State transitions are modified using data from humans interacting with other humans. The policies obtained by solving these models are used to control a robot in a socially situated task with a human partner. These interactions are compared to those of human pairs performing the same task, demonstrating that this approach produces policies that exhibit natural and socially appropriate behavior."

At KIT the Focus Anthropomatics and Robotics - APR has been set up by a number of research groups focusing on the research field of Anthropomatics and Robotics with more than 250 researchers. Modelling humans and their capabilities requires a deep understanding of the principle of biomechanics and kinematics, as well as the underlaying neural control principles and the perceptive and actuatoric system. Modelling and understanding of the sensomotoric mechanisms, learning and developement of skills and cognititve capabilities to enable humans to interact with the world is of high importance to design technical systems operating closely and interactively with humans via various modalities like speech, haptics, vision, grasping and locomotion. Typical research fields are related to active vision, interpretation of scenes and human activities, recognition and tracking technologies multimodal & perceptual user interfaces, understanding and translation of speech. Complementary research needed is related to the retrieval & access and summarization of multimedia data sources, translation of spoken text, context aware learning computers, implicit services and many more. The robotics application field ranges from interactive industrial robotics, service robotic companions, humanoids and medical robotics. In all domains the integrating aspects are focusing on algorithms processing real word data as well as open self-organizing architectures which allow autonomy, skill and task learning as well as interaction with humans. Our research emphasizes the critical path from basic understanding of cognitive processes and robotics foundations to applications in various domains. The research includes new approaches to sensor and actuator methodologies, foundations of machine perception, motion and action planning algorithms, simulation and computer graphics, robot machine learning, speech recognition and understanding, multimodal man-machine interaction, and many others. APR addresses the needs of humans in smart living environments and robotics focusing on both, basic foundations and applications. The focus has an intellectual center point on Anthropomatics and a commitment to Robotics as a new human centered discipline. The research is to explore new ideas and to build systematically systems which reflect human daily needs and a basic understanding of intelligent robots and adaptive safe system behaviour in general. Such cognitive robots are able to do tasks skillfully and efficiently together with humans, and they should be able to operate in dangerous or inaccessible areas. Furthermore, future robots should discover new things and learn new capabilities and knowledge about their environment and they should be able to reason about the effects of their actions and interventions. Thus, the basic capabilities to perform intelligent actions in the real world are perception, cognition, locomotion and skillful manipulation. The humanoid robot series ARMAR is used to illustrate recent research and achieved results in the field."
882012,15514,23735,"Cogeneration of Mechanical, Electrical, and Software Designs for Printable Robots from Structural Specifications",2014,"Designing and fabricating new robotic systems is typically limited to experts, requiring engineering background, expensive tools, and considerable time. In contrast, to facilitate everyday users developing custom robots for personal use, this work presents a new system to easily create printable foldable robots from high-level structural specifications. A user merely needs to select electromechanical components from a library of basic building blocks and pre-designed mechanisms, then connect them to define custom robot assemblies. The system then generates complete mechanical drawings suitable for fabrication, instructions for the assembly of electronics, and software to control and drive the final robot. Several robots designed in this manner demonstrate the ability and versatility of this process. I. INTRODUCTION While robots are widely used for research and commer- cial applications, they are not yet ubiquitous in everyday life for personalized tasks. Creating a new robotic system typically involves repeated design iterations using a variety of computer-aided design tools. Domain-specific expertise is generally required to create the requisite mechanical drawings for a structural body, electronic circuits to connect sensors and actuators, and software to manage system inputs and outputs. This entire process often needs to be rerun for each new robot desired, making the design and fabrication of new robots slow and introducing a knowledge barrier for casual users. For the general public to obtain a device able to accom- plish a specified function, computational tools are required that can create robots from high-level descriptions. The long- term objective is to develop a hardware compiler that can start with functional specifications of a desired system and automatically design and fabricate a robot to accomplish those. This paper takes a step towards that vision with a system to simultaneously generate the mechanical, electrical, and software components of a robot from its structural specifications, allowing non-experts to easily design elec- tromechanical systems with custom specifications and then quickly and inexpensively fabricate the designed robot. The presented approach modularizes mechanical, electri- cal, and software components to represent them in a database suitable for hierarchical composition. These parameterized components are characterized in terms of their geometric and physical properties; while experts can directly generate new low level building blocks, casual users can simply connect existing designs to make custom electromechanical devices. The system then automatically outputs a collection of files with which the user can manufacture the specified robot: fabrication drawings get sent to a desktop cutter to generate cut-and-fold origami-inspired 3D structures, wiring instructions guide the user to assemble sensors and actuators onto that structure using plug-and-play electronic modules, and libraries and application software get loaded onto a central microcontroller. The resulting robot can be wirelessly controlled from an auto-generated user interface (UI) on a smartphone."
942030,15514,23735,Finding Optimal Routes for Multi-Robot Patrolling in Generic Graphs,2014,"Multi-robot patrolling is a problem that has im- portant applications in security and surveillance. However, the optimal task assignment is known to be NP-hard. We consider evenly spacing the robots in a cyclic Traveling Sales- man Problem (TSP) tour or partitioning the graph of the environment. The trade-off in performance, overall team travel cost and coordination is analyzed in this paper. We provide both a theoretical analysis and simulation results across multiple environments. The results demonstrate that generally cyclic- based strategies are superior, especially when small teams are used but at the expense of greater team cost, whereas partitioning strategies are especially suitable for larger teams and unbalanced graph topologies. The reported results show that graph topology and team size are fundamental to determine the best choice for a patrol strategy. I. INTRODUCTION Advances on autonomous mobile robots have been evident in the last couple of decades. In particular, the patrolling problem with a team of cooperative agents has received much focus. The problem, which is also known as repet- itive sweeping, has unquestionable utility in society and finds its applications in surveillance systems, infrastructure security and inspection, search and rescue, mine clearing, military operations, environmental monitoring, intelligent transportation, household cleaning, and several other areas. Being monotonous, these tasks may also be dangerous. Thus, improving safety and reducing fatigue is a major advantage of multi-robot patrolling systems. In this context, robots are required to continuously travel in the environment, and the key challenge is to design efficient routes in order to optimize a certain performance criterion. Like most existing work in the literature (1-4), it is assumed that robots are homogeneous, travel with constant speed, and are expected to visit every strategic position of the environment. Therefore, having adequate sensing range, complete coverage of the environment is achieved by visiting all the important locations in the area. Despite several recent contributions to the problem, one question still remains open: what is the optimal patrol strategy for a given generic environment using R robots?

2933619,15514,23684,Efficient computation of representative sets with applications in parameterized and exact algorithms,2014,"Let M = (E, I) be a matroid and let S = {S1, ...,St} be a family of subsets of E of size p. A subfamily S ⊆ S is q-representative for S if for every set Y ⊆ E of size at most q, if there is a set X e S disjoint from Y with X ∪ Y e I, then there is a set X e S disjoint from Y with X ∪ Y e I. By the classical result of Bollobas, in a uniform matroid, every family of sets of size p has a q-representative family with at most (p+qp) sets. In his famous two families theorem from 1977, Lovasz proved that the same bound also holds for any matroid representable over a field F. As observed by Marx, Lovasz's proof is constructive. In this paper we show how Lovasz's proof can be turned into an algorithm constructing a q-representative family of size at most (p+qp) in time bounded by a polynomial in (p+qp), t, and the time required for field operations.#R##N##R##N#We demonstrate how the efficient construction of representative families can be a powerful tool for designing single-exponential parameterized (2O(k)) and exact exponential time (2O(k)) algorithms. The applications of our approach include the following.#R##N##R##N#• In the Long Directed Cycle problem the input is a directed n-vertex graph G and the positive integer k. The task is to find a directed cycle of length at least k in G, if such a cycle exists. As a consequence of our 8k+onO(1) time algorithm, we have that a directed cycle of length at least log n, if such cycle exists, can be found in polynomial time. As it was shown by Bjorklund, Husfeldt, and Khanna [ICALP 2004], under an appropriate complexity assumption, it is impossible to improve this guarantee by more than a constant factor. Thus our algorithm not only improves over the best previous log n/log log n bound of Gabow and Nie [SODA 2004] but also closes the gap between known lower and upper bounds for this problem.#R##N##R##N#• In the Minimum Equivalent Graph (MEG) problem we are seeking a spanning subdigraph D' of a given n-vertex digraph D with as few arcs as possible in which the reachability relation is the same as in the original digraph D. The existence of a single-exponential cn-time algorithm for some constant c > 1 for MEG was open since the work of Moyles and Thompson [JACM 1969].#R##N##R##N#• To demonstrate the diversity of applications of the approach, we provide an alternative proof of the results recently obtained by Bodlaender, Cygan, Kratsch and Nederlof for algorithms on graphs of bounded treewidth, who showed that many connectivity problems such as Hamiltonian Cycle or Steiner Tree can be solved in time 2O(t)n on n-vertex graphs of treewidth at most t. We believe that expressing graph problems in matroid language shed light on what makes it possible to solve connectivity problems single-exponential time parameterized by treewidth.#R##N##R##N#For the special case of uniform matroids on n elements, we give a faster algorithm computing a representative family in time O((p+q/q)q · 2o(p+q) · t · log n). We use this algorithm to provide the fastest known deterministic parameterized algorithms for k-Path, k-Tree, and more generally, for k-Subgraph Isomorphism, where the k-vertex pattern graph is of constant treewidth. For example, our k-Path algorithm runs in time O(2.851k n log2 n log W) on weighted graphs with maximum edge weight W."
1591556,15514,23735,Passive dynamic walking of compass-like biped robot with dynamic absorbers,2014,"This paper investigates the roles and effects of dynamic absorbers attached to the leg frames on the gait properties of passive dynamic walking. First, we model a passive compass-like biped robot that consists of two identical leg frames with passive dynamic absorbers that represent micromechanical vibration or human flesh dynamics. We then conduct gait analysis through numerical simulations to observe how small oscillation of the leg frames affects the gait prop- erties, and show that speeding-up is achieved by utilizing the indirect softness produced by the dynamic absorbers. Second, we investigate the dominant effect of small oscillation using the same model. The simulation results show high nonlinearity in the generated walking gait. I. INTRODUCTION Limit cycle walkers generate energy-efficient walking gaits by using the inherent natural dynamics (1). Recently, the studies on legged robots focusing on the leg stiffness have been conducted in the area of limit cycle walking. Kawamoto and Asano clarified that adaptability to uneven terrain can be improved by using leg viscoelasticity through numerical simulation and experiments (2). They also showed that viscoelastic-legged walkers have advantages to overcome steps and continue stable walking on various road conditions without changing the walking speed so much. They also showed that rigid-legged walkers have an advantage to gener- ate faster walking gaits than viscoelastic-legged ones but are less adaptive to uneven terrain. The leg viscoelasticity tends to create non-instantaneous double-limb support motion and this significantly decreases the walking speed. The center of mass (CoM) trajectory, however, becomes smoother and this would make the walker overcome the potential barrier at mid-stance easily. Similar results are also reported in (3). The above facts imply that soft leg-frames are important for improving the adaptability and maneuverability of the generated gait in return for high-speed movement. We hu- mans have both advantages of the leg stiffness and softness, and can easily generate high-speed and highly adaptive walking gaits. We should reconsider how the robot leg- frames should be designed to reproduce the high performance of human walking. The basis of the leg frames should be made of a solid material to achieve high-speed walking motion, while soft- ness should be added indirectly so that the period of non- instantaneous double-limb support motion becomes short. The importance of robot's internal softness reproduced as an wobbling motion has also been reported by Hanazawa et al. (4) and Ackerman et al. (5). The authors also found the validity of a 2-DOF wobbling mass in a passive rimless wheel (6). In these early works, however, the indirect softness was given as an additional linkage to the robot's body frame. Based on the observations, in this paper we propose a novel limit-cycle walker that have dynamic absorbers on the leg frames. We add dynamic absorbers parallel to the rigid leg frames for the purpose of indirectly reproducing the dynamical effect of viscoelastic legs while keeping high- stiffness of the legs. It is then expected that efficient passive or underactuated walking gaits can be generated without decreasing the walking speed. We introduce the model of a compass-like biped robot (7) that added dynamic absorbers parallel to the leg frames and numerically analyze the gait properties according to the change in the viscoelastic coefficients. We show that speeding-up of passive compass gait can be achieved by the effect of the dynamic absorbers during motion. We discuss the speeding-up mechanism mainly from the viewpoint of flattening of the CoM trajectory. In addition, we also show that some strange gaits are generated where the dynamic absorber motion is more dominant."
1366688,15514,23735,Single Muscle Site sEMG Interface for Assistive Grasping,2014,"We present a joint demonstration between the Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Controls Laboratory (RASCAL) at UC Davis and the Columbia University Robotics Group, wherein a human-in-the-loop robotic grasping platform in the Columbia lab (New York, NY) is controlled to select and grasp an object by a C3-C4 spinal cord injury (SCI) subject in the UC Davis lab (Davis, CA) using a new single-signal, multi- degree-of-freedom surface electromyography (sEMG) human- robot interface. The grasping system breaks the grasping task into a multi-stage pipeline that can be navigated with only a few inputs. It integrates pre-planned grasps with on-line grasp planning capability and an object recognition and target selection system capable of handling multi-object scenes with moderate occlusion. Previous work performed in the RASCAL lab demonstrated that by continuously modulating the power in two individual bands in the frequency spectrum of a single sEMG signal, users were able to control a cursor in 2D for cursor to target tasks. Using this paradigm, four targets were presented in order for the subject to command the multi- stage grasping pipeline. We demonstrate that using this system, operators are able to grasp objects in a remote location using a robotic grasping platform. I. INTRODUCTION Grasping objects is critical to many activities of daily life that present challenges to people with upper limb mobility impairments. This work presents an assistive grasping system using a human-in-the-loop for a disabled user to grasp objects from a table using a novel, non-invasive sEMG based input device even in somewhat cluttered scenes. The novel device measures only a single differential sEMG signal at one muscle site on the user. The system puts the user in control of a multi-stage grasping pipeline that includes object recogni- tion, integrated pre-planned and on-line grasp planning with feedback to help the user plan robust grasps in near real time. We show that an impaired user can successfully use this system to grasp objects using a real robotic grasping platform. The key contributions of this work include: a) In- tegration with a novel sEMG input device which relies on only a single muscle site. b) A new UI that improves the disabled user's ability to understand the scene and produce correct grasps in complex, cluttered environments. c) Online reachability analysis and feedback. d) Online assessment of the desired approach direction. e) Evaluation of this system on an impaired user in a remote location. f) A demonstration that this new UI is descriptive enough for the user to operate in an environment that they have never seen."
1629777,15514,23735,Study on rotational and unclogging motions of magnetic chain-like microrobot,2014,"Abstract Magnetic microrobotics was nowadays one of themost advanced technique to reach deep locations in humanbody for future biomedical applications. Different magneticmicrorobot designs were proposed, such as bead pulling ormicroswimmers. In this paper, the use of chain-like of magneticN -microspheres was investigated to enable new kind of motionsand applications. An accurate theoretical model of chain-likemagnetic microbeads navigating in viscous uidic environmentsis described. Thus, the behavior of such microrobot wasanalyzed for different number of microspheres (ranging fromN = 2 to 5). The efciency of the proposed technique wasdemonstrated experimentally in a microuidic vessel phantomto mimic atherosclerosis disease leading to plaque formationthat fully occluded a vasculature. I. INTRODUCTIONDesign of integrated devices with electrical, mechanical,chemical or biological components at microscale enablesnumerous opportunities to improve on broad range of appli-cations of technology, science and medicine [1]. In particular,it is well established that such microsystem can be used inmany biomedical applications including minimally invasivesurgical procedures [2]. Hence, when these microrobots arepropelled in uidic environments, especially in the bloodcirculatory system, a very large number of remote locationsin the human body become accessible. Although there aredifferent actuation methods proposed in the literature, theuse of external magnetic elds has many advantages thatcircumvent the need for delivering power to the device andensuring autonomous untethered motion of the microrobot[1]. Indeed, it has been shown that the coils of a clinical MRIsystem can be used to control untethered magnetic beads in3D directions [3]. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to over-come some MRI-based navigation constraints (eg. pulsatileow, variation of time-multiplexed sequence parameters,duty cycle of the propulsion gradients, and repetition timeof the tracking sequence, availability, etc.) [4]. To overcomethese limitations, several magnetic propulsion mainly basedon the induction of magnetic force and torque. As example,different magnetic microrobot designs are proposed in theliterature based on biologically inspired motion, such as heli-cal microswimmer [5], or beating agella microswimmer [6].Such conguration is suitable in arterioles and capillaries [7],or for small swimmers size [8].

1613690,15514,23634,Pre-reduction Graph Products: Hardnesses of Properly Learning DFAs and Approximating EDP on DAGs,2014,"The study of graph products is a major research topic and typically concerns the term f(G * H), e.g., to show that f(G * H) = f(G)f(H). In this paper, we study graph products in a non-standard form f(R[G * H] where R is a reduction, a transformation of any graph into an instance of an intended optimization problem. We resolve some open problems as applications. The first problem is minimum consistent deterministic finite automaton (DFA). We show a tight n1 -- e-approximation hardness, improving the n1/14-e hardness of [Pitt and Warmuth, STOC 1989 and JACM 1993], where n is the sample size. (In fact, we also give improved hardnesses for the case of acyclic DFA and NFA.) Due to Board and Pitt [Theoretical Computer Science 1992], this implies the hardness of properly learning DFAs assuming NP ≠ RP (the weakest possible assumption). This affirmatively answers an open problem raised 25 years ago in the paper of Pitt and Warmuth and the survey of Pitt [All 1989]. Prior to our results, this hardness only follows from the stronger hardness of improperly learning DFAs, which requires stronger assumptions, i.e., either a cryptographic or an average case complexity assumption [Kearns and Valiant STOC 1989 and J.ACM 1994; Daniely et al. STOC 2014]. The second problem is edge-disjoint paths (EDP) on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This problem admits an O(√n)-approximation algorithm [Chekuri, Khanna, and Shepherd, Theory of Computing 2006] and a matching Ω(√n) integrality gap, but so far only an n1/26 -- e hardness factor is known [Chuzhoy et al., STOC 2007]. (n denotes the number of vertices.) Our techniques give a tight n1/2 -- e hardness for EDP on DAGs, thus resolving its approximability status. As by-products of our techniques: (i) We give a tight hardness of packing vertex-disjoint k-cycles for large k, complimenting [Guruswami and Lee, ECCC 2014] and matching [Krivelevich et al., SODA 2005 and ACM Transactions on Algorithms 2007]. (ii) We give an alternative (and perhaps simpler) proof for the hardness of properly learning DNF, CNF and intersection of halfspaces [Alekhnovich et al., FOCS 2004 and J.Comput.Syst.Sci. 2008]. Our new concept reduces the task of proving hardnesses to merely analyzing graph product inequalities, which are often as simple as textbook exercises. This concept was inspired by, and can be viewed as a generalization of, the graph product subadditivity technique we previously introduced in SODA 2013. This more general concept might be useful in proving other hardness results as well."

It is signicant that the robot can grasp assembly partsand do some simple in-hand manipulation so as to t themwith the package slots. In this research, we study the processof precise in-hand posture transition problem using a noveljaw like gripper with human-sized anthropomorphic features.We transform the in-hand manipulation problem into a seriesof static grasping problems.

I. INTRODUCTIONCurrently in robotic assembly cell for exible manufactur-ing industry, there still remains many other unsolved issuesfor robots. One is that the robot cannot work efcientlyto deal with assembly parts with complicated shapes. Theyoften rely on external sensor systems to help with theassembly work [1]. On the other side, human workers areskilled in performing complicated tasks by hands, inspiredby which, it seems essential that the conventional roboticmanipulator is able to perform complicated manipulation likehuman worker does. Therefore, researchers tend to improvethe capacity of robots by designing various functional end-effectors (hands) for robots.In order to meet industrial application requirements, therobotic hands must be inexpensive, compact, low weightand robust. It also must be capable of performing simplegrasping and manipulation tasks, such as precision ma-nipulation, in-hand grasp transitions, and sufciently generalto manipulate different objects and tools. From previous re-searches, grippers are categorized in four groups: Impactive,Ingressive, Astrictive and Contigutive [3]. The majority ofindustrial grippers are either impactive or astrictive.

This paper presents a new telepresence robot with gesture-based attention direction to orient the robot towards attention targets according to human deictic gestures. Gesture-based attention direction is realized by combining Localist Attractor Network (LAN) and Short-Term Memory (STM). We also propose audio- visual fusion based on context-dependent prioritization among the 3 types of audio-visual cues (gesture, speech source location, head location). Experiment results are very promising and show that i) the average gesture recognition rate is 92%, i) gesture- based attention direction rate is 90%, and that ii) only by considering the 3 types of audio-visual cues together can the robot perform on par with a human in directing attention to the correct person in a meeting scenario. I. INTRODUCTION Telepresence technology, which enables people to com- municate face-to-face over remote distances, is gaining im- portance and popularity as a useful tool at home and in the workplace for increasing productivity and connecting people. The application of robotics-related technologies to telepresence can enhance user interaction experience by pro- viding embodiment, engaging behaviors, automatic control, and human perception. To this end, research-oriented telepresence robot platforms have been developed to study human-robot interaction. The MeBot (1) is a small mobile articulated telerobot that allows the operator to express non-verbal cues such as hand and head gestures. The Texai robot is a mobile platform with a screen at standing-height, and can be controlled to move around a remote office to attend meetings. Powered by HARK, an advanced audition software with sound source localization, tracking and separation capabilities, a sophis- ticated dialogue management and auditory awareness has been demonstrated on the Texai robot (2). To increase robustness of speaker tracking, audiovisual approaches have also been proposed. Omnidirectional vision combined with sound localization has been shown to track speakers as they are move around the robot (3). Computational AudioVisual Scene Analysis (CAVSA) based on proto-objects and short term memory (4) has been designed to track speakers even if they disappear for a while. Our previous work studied audio-visual attention control based on speech source lo- calization and visual face tracking for a telepresence robot, and presented a user study showing facilitation of show-and- tell and increased presence (5). Audio-visual integration has"
767415,15514,23735,Ear-based Exploration on Hybrid Metric/Topological Maps,2014,"In this paper we propose a hierarchy of techniques for performing loop closure in indoor environments together with an exploration strategy designed to reduce uncertainty in the resulting map. We use the generalized Voronoi graph to represent the indoor environment and an extended Kalman filter to track the pose of the robot and the position of the junctions (vertices) of the topological graph. Every time a vertex is revisited, the robot re-localizes and updates the uncertainty estimate accordingly. Finally, since the reduction of the map uncertainty remains one of the main concerns, the robot will optimize its schedule of revisiting junctions in the environment in order to reduce the accumulated uncertainty. Experimental results from a mobile robot equipped with a laser range-finder and results from realistic simulations that validate our approach are presented. I. INTRODUCTION This paper presents a solution to the problem of mapping an indoor environment by combining local sensor data into a hybrid topological/metric representation. The presented approach includes an exploration strategy, an environment representation, and a hierarchical approach to the loop clo- sure problem. More specifically, it is assumed that the envi- ronment is static and that the robot has no prior knowledge of its starting position or the space layout. The environment is completely GPS-denied and the only sensory information available to the robot are scans from a laser range-finder and odometry information; see Fig. 1. The proposed algorithm presents a robust way of mapping an unknown environment by performing loop closure in a systematic manner. The main building block of this work is the efficient on-line construction of the 2D generalized Voronoi graph (GVG) (1) based on local laser scans taken by the robot. Many different environments can be mapped adequately using a topological (graph) representation. The most com- mon ones are indoor areas with long corridors, such as those found in office buildings, but underground mines and cave systems are also good candidates. The main advantage of topological representations is that they encode path-planning guidance for the vehicle through a roadmap representation, without using high-dimensional representations of the envi- ronment. In other words, the robot can move through the environment by simply following a path in the roadmap graph. In addition, the nodes in the graph provide distinct places which can be used for localization. In this paper, the topological representation used is the generalized Voronoi graph (GVG), a graph that encodes all the points in free"
1648692,15514,23735,Human-swarm interaction using spatial gestures,2014,"This paper presents a machine vision based ap- proach for human operators to select individual and groups of autonomous robots from a swarm of UAVs. The angular distance between the robots and the human is estimated using measures of the detected human face, which aids to determine human and multi-UAV localization and positioning. In turn, this is exploited to effectively and naturally make the human select the spatially situated robots. Spatial gestures for selecting robots are presented by the human operator using tangible input devices (i.e., colored gloves). To select individuals and groups of robot we formulate a vocabulary of two-handed spatial pointing gestures. With the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained in a cascaded multi-binary-class configuration, the spatial gestures are effectively learned and recognized by a swarm of UAVs. I. INTRODUCTION Without the use of teleoperated and hand-held interaction devices, human operators generally face difficulties in select- ing and commanding individual and groups of robots from a relatively large group of spatially distributed robots (i.e., a swarm). However, due to the widespread availability of cost effective digital cameras onboard UGVs and UAVs, it is increasing the attention towards developing uninstrumented methods (i.e., methods that do not use sophisticated hardware devices from the human side) for human-swarm interaction (HSI). In previous work, we focused on learning efficient features incrementally (online) from multi-viewpoint images of multiple gestures that were acquired by a swarm of ground robots (1). In this paper, we present a cascaded supervised machine learning approach to deal with the machine vision problem of selecting 3D spatially-situated robots from a networked swarm based on the recognition of spatial hand gestures. These are a natural, easy recognizable, and device- less way to enable human operators to easily interact with external artifacts such as robots. Inspired by natural human behavior, we propose an ap- proach that combines face engagement and pointing gestures to interact with a swarm of robots: standing in front of a population of robots, by looking at them and pointing at them with spatial gestures, a human operator can designate individual or groups of robots of determined size. Robots cooperate to combine their independent observations of the human's face and gestures to cooperatively determine which robots were addressed (i.e., selected). While state of the art computer vision techniques pro- vide excellent face detection, human skeleton, and gesture recognition in ideal conditions, there are often occlusions,"
1664963,15514,23735,Intuitive Skill-Level Programming of Industrial Handling Tasks on a Mobile Manipulator,2014,"In order for manufacturing companies to remain competitive while also offering a high degree of customization for the customers, flexible robots that can be rapidly repro- grammed to new tasks need to be applied in the factories. In this paper we propose a method for the intuitive programming of an industrial mobile robot by combining robot skills, a graphical user interface and human gesture recognition. We give a brief introduction to robot skills as we envision them for intuitive programming, and how they are used in the robot system. We then describe the tracking and gesture recognition, and how the instructor uses the method for programming. We have verified our approach through experiments on several subjects, showing that the system is generally easy to use even for inexperienced users. Furthermore, the programming time required to program a new task is very short, especially keeping traditional industrial robot programming methods in mind. I. INTRODUCTION Manufacturing companies have experienced the challenges of mass customization for a long period of time. As cus- tomers demand more customization options for products, tra- ditional mass production becomes problematic. While mass production focuses on producing large volumes of identical items with high efficiency, mass customization needs to maintain the production volume, but also offer products with a highly varied feature set. In order to do this, flexible robotic solutions appear more promising than stationary robot cells. A key issue of flexible robots is to be able to reprogram them on the fly when a new task is needed in the factory. Currently, industrial robots are programmed by experts to do specific motions and follow specific paths in a highly structured environment. In order for the robots to be truly flexible, they need to be able to handle a variety of different tasks, and they must be reprogrammed fast when a new task in the factory arises. In this paper, we propose a method for intuitive and fast programming of a mobile industrial robot using robot skills in conjunction with a graphical user interface and human gestures. Using the skills as fundamental building blocks, it is easy for a shop floor worker to form complex tasks. The skills need to be supplied with parameters, stating on which objects they should be executed, e.g. the Pick up   skill needs to know which object to pick up. The sequencing of skills is done on a touchpad device, and the teaching of the parameters for the individual skills are done by performing specific gestures, such as pointing at objects to pick up."
1245295,15514,23735,Exploiting global force torque measurements for local compliance estimation in tactile arrays,2014,"In this paper we tackle the problem of estimating the local compliance of tactile arrays exploiting global mea- surements from a single force and torque sensor. The proposed procedure exploits a transformation matrix (describing the relative position between the local tactile elements and the global force/torque measurements) to define a linear regression problem on the unknown local stiffness. Experiments have been conducted on the foot of the iCub robot, sensorized with a single force/torque sensor and a tactile array of 250 taxels on the foot sole. Results show that a simple calibration procedure can be employed to estimate the stiffness parameters of virtual springs over a tactile array and to use these model to predict normal forces exerted on the array based only on the tactile feedback. Leveraging on previous works (1) we show that the proposed procedure does not necessarily need a-priori information on the transformation matrix of the tactile elements (taxels) which can be directly estimated from available measurements. I. INTRODUCTION One of the main challenges for current legged robotic platforms is to operate in unstructured environments and safely traverse rough terrains. To improve the adaptability to different grounds several approaches have been proposed, which consist of mechanical solutions to regulate the leg's active and passive properties and new sensors for enhancing environmental sensing. In particular to let robots overcame their current limitations, we need to advance their capability in perception of the environment physical properties. As to this concern it becomes important to understand how it is possible to improve the quality of haptic information and how to better integrate acquisitions from different sensors. During locomotion the most important haptic informations are represented by the contact forces between terrain and robot feet. These forces have a great relevance in stabilizing the robot because it is throughout these forces that the robot can actuate the underactuated degrees of freedom, like the center of mass (CoM) position and the floating base orientation. So far, starting from the simplifying assumption that the contact area is planar and has the necessary friction to keep the feet from sliding, different theoretical frameworks have been developed to regulate contact forces during tasks such as locomotion. In the late sixties, kinematic controllers solely"
2347602,15514,20774,Efficient computation of distance sketches in distributed networks,2012,"Distance computation (e.g., computing shortest paths) is one of the most fundamental primitives used in communication networks. The cost of effectively and accurately computing pairwise network distances can become prohibitive in large-scale networks such as the Internet and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. To negotiate the rising need for very efficient distance computation at scales never imagined before, approximation techniques for numerous variants of this question have recently received significant attention in the literature. Several different areas of theoretical research have emerged centered around this problem, such as metric embeddings, distance labelings, spanners, and distance oracles. The goal is to preprocess the graph and store a small amount of information such that whenever a query for any pairwise distance is issued, the distance can be well approximated (i.e., with small stretch) very quickly in an online fashion. Specifically, the pre-processing (usually) involves storing a small sketch with each node, such that at query time only the sketches of the concerned nodes need to be looked up to compute the approximate distance. Techniques derived from metric embeddings have been considered extensively by the networking community, usually under the name of network coordinate systems. On the other hand, while the computation of distance oracles has received considerable attention in the context of web graphs and social networks, there has been little work towards similar algorithms within the networking community. In this paper, we present the first theoretical study of distance sketches derived from distance oracles in a distributed network. We first present a fast distributed algorithm for computing approximate distance sketches, based on a distributed implementation of the distance oracle scheme of [Thorup-Zwick, JACM 2005]. We also show how to modify this basic construction to achieve different tradeoffs between the number of pairs for which the distance estimate is accurate, the size of the sketches, and the time and message complexity necessary to compute them. These tradeoffs can then be combined to give an efficient construction of small sketches with provable average-case as well as worst-case performance. Our algorithms use only small-sized messages and hence are suitable for bandwidth-constrained networks, and can be used in various networking applications such as topology discovery and construction, token management, load balancing, monitoring overlays, and several other problems in distributed algorithms."
1255696,15514,23684,Improved dynamic algorithms for maintaining approximate shortest paths under deletions,2011,"We present the first dynamic shortest paths algorithms that make any progress beyond a long-standing  O ( n ) update time barrier (while maintaining a reasonable query time), although it is only progress for not-too-sparse graphs. In particular, we obtain new decremental algorithms for two approximate shortest-path problems in unweighted, undirected graphs. Both algorithms are randomized (Las Vegas).   • Given a source  s , we present an algorithm that maintains (1 + e)-approximate shortest paths from  s  with an expected  total  update time of  O ( n  2+ O (1/√log  n ) ) over all deletions (so the amortized time is about  O ( n  2 / m )). The worst-case query time is constant. The best previous result goes back  three  decades to Even and Shiloach [16] and Dinitz [12]. They show how to decrementally maintain an  exact  shortest path tree with a total update time of  O ( mn ) (amortized update time  O ( n )). Roditty and Zwick [22] have shown that  O ( mn ) is actually optimal for  exact  paths (barring a better combinatorial algorithm for boolean matrix multiplication), unless we are willing to settle for a Ω( n ) query time. In fact, until now, even  approximate  dynamic algorithms were not able to go beyond  O ( mn ).   • For any fixed integer  k  ≥ 2, we present an algorithm that decrementally maintains a distance oracle (for  all pairs  shortest distances) with a total expected update time of  O ( n  2+1/ k + O (1/√log  n ) ) (amortized update time about  O ( n  2+1/ k  / m ). The space requirement is only  O ( m  +  n  1+1/ k  ), the stretch of the returned distances is at most 2 k  − 1 + e, and the worst-case query time is  O (1). The best previous result of Roditty and Zwick [21] had a total update time of  O ( mn ) and a stretch of 2 k  − 1. Note that our algorithm implicitly solves the decremental all-pairs shortest path problem with the same bounds; the best previous approximation algorithm of Roditty and Zwick [21] returned (1 + e) approximate distances, but used  O ( n  2 ) space, and required  O ( mn ) total update time. As with the previous problem, our algorithm is the first to make progress beyond the  O ( mn ) total update time barrier while maintaining a small query time.   We present a general framework for accelerating decremental algorithms. In particular, our main idea is to run existing decremental algorithms on a sparse subgraph (such as a spanner or emulator) of the graph rather than on the original graph  G . Although this is a common approach for  static  approximate shortest-path problems, it has never been used in a decremental setting because maintaining the subgraph  H  as edges are being deleted from  G  might require  inserting  edges into  H , thus ruining the decrementality of the setting. We overcome this by presenting an emulator whose maintenance only requires a limited number of well-behaved insertions.   In other words, we present a general technique for running decremental algorithms on a sparse subgraph of the graph. Once our framework is in place, applying it to any particular decremental algorithm only requires trivial modifications; most of the work consists of showing that these algorithms  as they are  still work in our restricted fully dynamic setting, where we encounter not just arbitrary deletions (as in the original setting), but also restricted insertions."
1135190,15514,23735,Decentralized and complete multi-robot motion planning in confined spaces,2014,"This paper presents the Push-Swap-Wait (PSW) algorithm, a scalable, decentralized and complete approach for multi-robot motion planning in confined spaces. The algorithm builds upon a push and swap paradigm that has been used effectively in centralized navigation. This push and swap approach was expanded to apply to decentralized planning by adding a waiting mode to handle situations in which communication between robots is lost. The completeness of the PSW algorithm can be guaranteed in cases where the environment can be modeled as a tree T for which the number of leaf nodes is greater than the number of robots navigating through it. The algorithm has a time complexity that is linear with the number of robots currently within communication, indicating that this algorithm is well suited for scaling to large systems of robots. To validate the PSW algorithm it was implemented successfully in multi-robot simulations and on hardware with four Dr. Robot Jaguar Lite Robots. I. INTRODUCTION Multi-robot systems have demonstrated the potential to increase performance over single robot systems in tasks re- quiring decreased mission times, spatio-temporal sampling, robustness to mission failure, and force multiplication (2), (5). This paper addresses the problem of coordinating the motion of multiple robots attempting to reach their indepen- dent goal destinations in single lane tunnel environments. In general, Multi Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) can be accomplished with acentralized control architecture, in which one robot or agent dictates the motion of all robots, or using a decentralized architecture in which each robot calculates its own motions. Additionally, the algorithms im- plemented within these architectures can either be coupled, in which the algorithm searches the composite configuration space of all robots to construct paths for all robots, or decoupled, in which the algorithms search each individual robot's configuration space for individual paths that are later coordinated. Implementation of both coupled and decoupled planning can be centralized, but decentralized architectures are more amenable to decoupled planning. Several centralized approaches for robot navigation in confined spaces already exist (14), (10), (11), (3). Some of these algorithms have the desirable property of being complete - that is, they guarantee that a solution will be found if it exists. Such algorithms can also be classified as either optimal or non-optimal. Optimal algorithms, such as search algorithms like A*, are capable of computing the"
603936,15514,23684,A unified approach to truthful scheduling on related machines,2013,"We present a unified framework for designing deterministic monotone polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS's) for a wide class of scheduling problems on uniformly related machines. This class includes (among others) minimizing the makespan, maximizing the minimum load, and minimizing the ep norm of the machine loads vector. Previously, this kind of result was only known for the makespan objective. Monotone algorithms have the property that an increase in the speed of a machine cannot decrease the amount of work assigned to it. The key idea of our novel method is to show that for goal functions that are sufficiently well-behaved functions of the machine loads, it is possible to compute in polynomial time a highly structured nearly optimal schedule.#R##N##R##N#An interesting aspect of our approach is that, in contrast to all known approximation schemes, we avoid rounding any job sizes or speeds throughout. We can therefore find the exact best structured schedule using dynamic programming. The state space encodes a sufficient amount of information such that no postprocessing is needed, allowing an elegant and relatively simple analysis without any special cases. The monotonicity is a consequence of the fact that we find the best schedule in a specific collection of schedules. Monotone approximation schemes have an important role in the emerging area of algorithmic mechanism design. In the game-theoretical setting of these scheduling problems there is a social goal, which is one of the objective functions that we study. Each machine is controlled by a selfish single-parameter agent, where its private information is its cost of processing a unit sized job, which is also the inverse of the speed of its machine. Each agent wishes to maximize its own profit, defined as the payment it receives from the mechanism minus its cost for processing all jobs assigned to it, and places a bid which corresponds to its private information. For each one of the problems, we show that we can calculate payments that guarantee truthfulness in an efficient manner. Thus, there exists a dominant strategy where agents report their true speeds, and we show the existence of a truthful mechanism which can be implemented in polynomial time, where the social goal is approximated within a factor of 1 + e for every e > 0."
942396,15514,9475,Analysis of a tunable impedance method for practical control of insect-inspired flapping-wing MAVs,2011,"In the past decade, research into insect-inspired flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicles (FWMAV) has grown steadily, toward addressing unique challenges in morphological construction, force production, and control strategy. Remarkable results have emerged from work focused on generation of adequate lift force for levitation and vertical acceleration [1]; however, effective methods for motion control still remain an open problem. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a novel approach to FWMAV control problem that provides smooth, stable and independent flight in both vertical and horizontal maneuvers. Our insect-inspired MAV model employs a passive structure to adjust the angle of attack (AoA) of its wings. Further analysis of this design unveils its capability in creating significant amounts of net drag force without disturbing lift production. This is the foundation of ‘tunable impedance’ technique that allows us to independently control three basic motions. One controller regulates yaw and forward acceleration, utilizing intuitive PID control laws in order to control horizontal maneuvers. Lift force and corresponding vertical elevation changes are controlled by a second controller that modifies the frequency of a constant-amplitude, sinusoidal power stroke. A third controller stabilizes the vehicle's body pitch angle through biasing stroke angle of its wings, hence rejecting disturbances caused by fluctuations in the position of center of mass (CoM). Results of simulated experiments confirm that these three controllers together demonstrate exceptional ability in handling hovering or agile flight maneuvers - even in presence of moderate measurement noise. These results also suggest that employment of passive dynamics in the design of MAVs may not only reduce actuator bandwidth requirements - thus simplifying practical implementation of the vehicle - but also improve robustness to uncertainties in sensing and body morphology."
860624,15514,20774,On dynamics in selfish network creation,2013,"We consider the dynamic behavior of several variants of the Network Creation Game, introduced by Fabrikant et al. [PODC'03]. Equilibrium networks in these models have desirable properties like low social cost and small diameter, which makes them attractive for the decentralized creation of overlay-networks. Unfortunately, due to the non-constructiveness of the Nash equilibrium, no distributed algorithm for  finding  such networks is known. We treat these games as sequential-move games and analyze if (uncoordinated) selfish play eventually converges to an equilibrium. Thus, we shed light on one of the most natural algorithms for this problem: distributed local search, where in each step some agent performs a myopic selfish improving move.   We show that fast convergence is guaranteed for all versions of Swap Games, introduced by Alon et al. [SPAA'10], if the initial network is a tree. Furthermore, we prove that this process can be sped up to an almost optimal number of moves by employing a very natural move policy. Unfortunately, these positive results are no longer true if the initial network has cycles and we show the surprising result that even one non-tree edge suffices to destroy the convergence guarantee. This answers an open problem from Ehsani et al. [SPAA'11] in the negative. Moreover, we show that on non-tree networks no move policy can enforce convergence. We extend our negative results to the well-studied original version, where agents are allowed to buy and delete edges as well. For this model we prove that there is no convergence guarantee - even if all agents play optimally. Even worse, if played on a non-complete host-graph, then there are instances where no sequence of improving moves leads to a stable network. Furthermore, we analyze whether cost-sharing has positive impact on the convergence behavior. For this we consider a version by Corbo and Parkes [PODC'05] where bilateral consent is needed for the creation of an edge and where edge-costs are shared among the involved agents. We show that employing such a cost-sharing rule yields even worse dynamic behavior.."
707514,15514,23684,Streaming k -means on well-clusterable data,2011,"One of the central problems in data-analysis is  k -means clustering. In recent years, considerable attention in the literature addressed the  streaming  variant of this problem, culminating in a series of results (Har-Peled and Mazumdar; Frahling and Sohler; Frahling, Monemizadeh, and Sohler; Chen) that produced a (1 + e)-approximation for  k -means clustering in the streaming setting. Unfortunately, since optimizing the  k -means objective is Max-SNP hard, all algorithms that achieve a (1 + e)-approximation must take time exponential in  k  unless P=NP.   Thus, to avoid exponential dependence on  k , some additional assumptions must be made to guarantee high quality approximation and polynomial running time. A recent paper of Ostrovsky, Rabani, Schulman, and Swamy (FOCS 2006) introduced the very natural assumption of  data separability : the assumption closely reflects how  k -means is used in practice and allowed the authors to create a high-quality approximation for  k -means clustering in the non-streaming setting with polynomial running time even for large values of  k.  Their work left open a natural and important question: are similar results possible in a  streaming  setting? This is the question we answer in this paper, albeit using substantially different techniques.   We show a near-optimal streaming approximation algorithm for  k -means in high-dimensional Euclidean space with sublinear memory and a single pass, under the same data separability assumption. Our algorithm offers significant improvements in both space and running time over previous work while yielding asymptotically best-possible performance (assuming that the running time must be fully polynomial and P ≠ NP).   The novel techniques we develop along the way imply a number of additional results: we provide a high-probability performance guarantee for online facility location (in contrast, Meyerson's FOCS 2001 algorithm gave bounds only in expectation); we develop a constant approximation method for the general class of semi-metric clustering problems; we improve (even without σ-separability) by a logarithmic factor space requirements for streaming constant-approximation for  k -median; finally we design a re-sampling method in a streaming setting to convert any constant approximation for clustering to a [1 +  O (σ 2 )]-approximation for σ-separable data."
1501170,15514,23735,Design of hands for aerial manipulation: Actuator number and routing for grasping and perching,2014,"This paper examines aspects of robot hand performance specific to grasping and perching from an aerial vehicle and shows how various hand design parameters affect performance. Specifically, we consider hand performance when subject to external forces imparted to the hand from carrying a payload or from perching on a fixed item and explore the impact of design and grasp parameters including tendon routing/pulley ratio, object size, and palm size on the performance of both fully and underactuated designs. Our results show that underactuated designs utilizing a single actuator per finger are sufficient in all cases we studied, but that fully actuated designs can perform better for perching applications. Additionally, we find that increasing the palm width improves performance both when perching and grasping, and that a small distal/proximal pulley ratio is beneficial for payload carriage but counterproductive for perching. I. INTRODUCTION As aerial vehicles begin to take on increasingly greater roles in both civilian and military applications, physically interacting with the world through aerial manipulation is becoming possible. However, the challenges associated with grasping and manipulation from aerial vehicles are many: necessity for lightweight structures, prompting simplistic and efficient designs; low impedance and instability of the vehicle during flight, requiring and allowing relatively small contact force magnitudes and in only a few directions; and limited ability to orient an end-effector with respect to the vehicle, among others. The design of the hand for an aerial manipulator must take into account these challenges and limitations in order to allow for good performance. In this paper we discuss how the choice of the number of actuators, the routing of those to the links of a hand, and other factors such as palm width affect the ability of the hand to perform both payload carriage and perching tasks. While aerial manipulation platforms are becoming more prevalent, there have been few concerted efforts to investigate designs of grippers for these systems. Instead, most vehicles are equipped with simple manipulators or repurposed hands based on existing designs (1-9). Many of these systems have utilized underactuated hand designs because the benefits of underactuation, including adaptability, robustness, and lower hand complexity and mass. Although beneficial during all kinds of manipulation"
2714753,15514,23845,Correct Software Synthesis for Stable Speed-Controlled Robotic Walking,2013,"We present a software synthesis method for speed- controlled robot walking based on supervisory control of a context-free Motion Grammar. First, we use Human-Inspired control to identify parameters for fixed speed walking and for transitions between fixed speeds, guaranteeing dynamic stability. Next, we build a Motion Grammar representing the discrete- time control for this set of speeds. Then, we synthesize C code from this grammar and generate supervisors 1 online to achieve desired walking speeds, guaranteeing correctness of discrete computation. Finally, we demonstrate this approach on the Aldebaran NAO, showing stable walking transitions with dynamically selected speeds. I. INTRODUCTION Walking provides key advantages for robot locomotion. Walkers are holonomic, they move over rough and uneven terrain, and they adjust their center of mass to better manip- ulate their environment. Producing stable walking on bipedal robots, however, is a challenging control problem. To compose walking with more varied and autonomous robot actions, the robot must safely and reliably transition between different walking behaviors (25, 19). In this work, we focus on one type of behavior: transitioning between different walking velocities to increase flexibility of walking locomotion. Reliable walking depends on both dynamic stability across a variety of modes and correctness of the discrete software implementation. We present a method to achieve both dynamic stability and discrete correctness in the domain of walking speed regulation by implementing Human-Inspired control of bipedal robots using a supervised Motion Grammar, automatically generating stable and correct hybrid control software. The contribution of this paper is a method for automatic synthesis of software for speed-controlled bipedal robot walk- ing and an experimental realization on the NAO robot. Using Human-Inspired control, we generate parameters for walking at fixed and transition speeds (20) (Sect. IV-A), guaranteeing dynamic, continuous stability. Then, we automatically convert this set of steps and transitions to a context-free Motion Grammar (8) (Sect. IV-B), which provides key benefits for control implementation. With a context-free grammar, we can efficiently specify a hierarchical, discrete time controller for step-taking within a single language framework (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). From this single language, we automatically generate the con- trol software for the robot (Sect. V-A) without tedious hand- coding. Then, we apply supervisory control, guaranteeing"
1410048,15514,23735,Attention driven grasping for clearing a heap of objects,2012,"Generation of grasps for automated object manipulation in cluttered scenarios presents major challenges for various modules of the pipeline such as 2D/3D visual processing, 3D modeling, grasp hypothesis generation, grasp planning and path planning. In this paper, we present a solution framework for solving a complex instance of the problem - represented by a heap of unknown and unstructured objects in a bounded environment - in our case, a box; with the goal being removing all objects in the box using an attention driven object modeling approach to cognitive grasp planning. The focus of the algorithm delves on Grasping by Components (GBC), with a prioritization scheme derived from scene based attention and attention driven segmentation. In order to overcome the traditional challenge of segmentation performing poorly in cluttered scenes, we employ a novel active segmentation approach suited to our scenario. While the attention module helps prioritize objects in the heap and salient regions, the GBC scheme segments out parts and generates grasp hypotheses for each part. GBC is a very important component of any scalable and holistic grasping system since it abstracts point cloud object data with parametric shapes and no apriori knowledge (such as 3D models) is required. Earlier work in 3D model building (such as CAD based, simple geometries, bounding boxes, Superquadrics etc.) have depended on precise shape and pose recognition as well as exhaustive training to learn or exhaustive searching in grasp space to generate good grasp hypotheses. These methods are not scalable for real-time scenarios, complex shapes and unknown environments - key challenges in robotic grasping. In order to alleviate this concern, we present a novel parametric algorithm to estimate grasp points and approach vectors from the 3D parametric shape model, along with innovative schemes to optimize the computation of the parametric models as well as to refine the generated grasp hypotheses based on the scene information to aid path planning. We present evaluation of our complex grasping pipeline for cluttered heaps through a series of test sequences involving removal of objects from a box, along with evaluations for our attention mechanisms, active segmentation, 3D model fitting optimizations and quality of our grasp hypotheses."
2995992,15514,23684,Compression via matroids: a randomized polynomial kernel for odd cycle transversal,2012,"The Odd Cycle Transversal problem (OCT) asks whether a given graph can be made bipartite by deleting at most k of its vertices. In a breakthrough result Reed, Smith, and Vetta (Operations Research Letters, 2004) gave a O(4kkmn) time algorithm for it, the first algorithm with polynomial runtime of uniform degree for every fixed k. It is known that this implies a polynomial-time compression algorithm that turns OCT instances into equivalent instances of size at most O(4k), a so-called kernelization. Since then the existence of a polynomial kernel for OCT, i.e., a kernelization with size bounded polynomially in k, has turned into one of the main open questions in the study of kernelization. Despite the impressive progress in the area, including the recent development of lower bound techniques (Bodlaender et al., ICALP 2008; Fortnow and Santhanam, STOC 2008) and meta-results on kernelizations for graph problems on planar and other sparse graph classes (Bodlaender et al., FOCS 2009; Fomin et al., SODA 2010), the existence of a polynomial kernel for OCT has remained open, even when the input is restricted to be planar.#R##N##R##N#This work provides the first (randomized) polynomial kernelization for OCT. We introduce a novel kernelization approach based on matroid theory, where we encode all relevant information about a problem instance into a matroid with a representation of size polynomial in k. For OCT, the matroid is built to allow us to simulate the computation of the iterative compression step of the algorithm of Reed, Smith, and Vetta, applied (for only one round) to an approximate odd cycle transversal which it is aiming to shrink to size k. The process is randomized with one-sided error exponentially small in k, where the result can contain false positives but no false negatives, and the size guarantee is cubic in the size of the approximate solution. Combined with an O(√ log n)-approximation (Agarwal et al., STOC 2005), we get a reduction of the instance to size O(k4.5), implying a randomized polynomial kernelization. Interestingly, the known lower bound techniques can be seen to exclude randomized kernels that produce no false negatives, as in fact they exclude even co-nondeterministic kernels (Dell and van Melkebeek, STOC 2010). Therefore, our result also implies that deterministic kernels for OCT cannot be excluded by the known machinery."
2582775,15514,23684,"Generalized perron: frobenius theorem for multiple choice matrices, and applications",2013,"The celebrated Perron--Frobenius (PF) theorem is stated for irreducible nonnegative square matrices, and provides a simple characterization of their eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The importance of this theorem stems from the fact that eigenvalue problems on such matrices arise in many fields of science and engineering, including dynamical systems theory, economics, statistics and optimization. However, many real-life scenarios give rise to nonsquare matrices. Despite the extensive development of spectral theories for nonnegative matrices, the applicability of such theories to non-convex optimization problems is not clear. In particular, a natural question is whether the PF Theorem (along with its applications) can be generalized to a nonsquare setting. Our paper provides a generalization of the PF Theorem to nonsquare multiple choice matrices. The extension can be interpreted as representing systems with additional degrees of freedom, where each client entity may choose between multiple servers that can cooperate in serving it (while potentially interfering with other clients). This formulation is motivated by applications to power control in wireless networks, economics and others, all of which extend known examples for the use of the original PF Theorem.#R##N##R##N#We show that the option of cooperation does not improve the situation, in the sense that in the optimum solution, no cooperation is needed, and only one server per client entity needs to work. Hence, the additional power of having several potential servers per client translates into choosing the best single server and not into sharing the load between the servers in some way, as one might have expected.#R##N##R##N#The two main contributions of the paper are (i) a generalized PF Theorem that characterizes the optimal solution for a non-convex problem, and (ii) an algorithm for finding the optimal solution in polynomial time.#R##N##R##N#In addition, we extend the definitions of irreducibility and largest eigenvalue of square matrices to nonsquare ones in a novel and non-trivial way, which turns out to be necessary and sufficient for our generalized theorem to hold.#R##N##R##N#To characterize the optimal solution, we use techniques from a wide range of areas. In particular, the analysis exploits combinatorial properties of polytopes, graph-theoretic techniques and analytic tools such as spectral properties of nonnegative matrices and root characterization of integer polynomials."
862461,15514,23735,Identification of HRP-2 foot's dynamics,2014,"This paper describes the identification of HRP-2 foot's dynamics. It is expected that a humanoid robot will work in the same environment as man. For that purpose, safety of operation is important. Although a simulator is used for con- firming safe conditions of operation, an error may arise in a dynamic parameter by the robot of a simulator, and an actual robot. In this paper, it identified about the viscoelasticity of the sole bush for impact absorption at the time of the walk of hu- manoid robot HRP-2. We used some simple active motions and composed these motions. We identified parameter using com- posed motions. We finally compare the identified parameters using the experimental results and simulator results. I. INTRODUCTION With the developments of the robotics, humanoid robot that can interact with human is now expected. It is necessary to know the exact dynamics for controlling such a robot. For example, computed torque method (1) is usually used to control a robot and this method requires a precise dynamic model of the robot. However, errors often come out of the robot's dynamic model since they often use CAD data. Moreover, the classic identification of using torque or their estimation (2) is subject to various influences about a joint. Therefore, the base-link identification method presented in (3) which does not require the torque measurements is useful to identify the dynamics of complex systems, in particular humanoid robots (4). A two-legged robot contacts chiefly with its environment by the sole of its feet. Therefore, in order to absorb the shock at the time of walking, rubber bushes are used. The rubber bush has a complex structure. This structure must be simulated in the robot dynamic simulator to achieve realistic simulations and model-based control. The accuracy of the inertial pa- rameters and the viscoelastic parameters specific to the robot is crucial to simulate the robot motions accurately. In this research, after identifying the inertial parameters of the hu- manoid robot HRP-2 as presented in (3), we now identify the viscoelastic properties of the sole rubber bush. In this paper, we use the equation of viscoelasticity iden- tification of a bush from a base link equation of motion. In order to increase identification accuracy, we generated some simple exciting motions. We used active motions and con- catenate these motions. We finally compare the identified parameters using the experimental results and simulator re- sults."
291162,15514,23684,"Half-integrality, LP-branching and FPT algorithms",2014,"A recent trend in parameterized algorithms is the application of polytope tools (specifically, LP-branching) to FPT algorithms (e.g., Cygan et al., 2011; Narayanaswamy et al., 2012). Though the list of work in this direction is short, the results are already interesting, yielding significant speedups for a range of important problems. However, the existing approaches require the underlying polytope to have very restrictive properties, including half-integrality and Nemhauser-Trotter-style persistence properties. To date, these properties are essentially known to hold only for two classes of polytopes, covering the cases of Vertex Cover (Nemhauser and Trotter, 1975) and Node Multiway Cut (Garg et al., 1994).#R##N##R##N#Taking a slightly different approach, we view half-integrality as a discrete relaxation of a problem, e.g., a relaxation of the search space from {0, 1}V to {0, 1/2, 1}V such that the new problem admits a polynomial-time exact solution. Using tools from CSP (in particular Thapper and Zivný, 2012) to study the existence of such relaxations, we are able to provide a much broader class of half-integral polytopes with the required properties.#R##N##R##N#Our results unify and significantly extend the previously known cases. In addition to the new insight into problems with half-integral relaxations, our results yield a range of new and improved FPT algorithms, including an O*(|Σ|2k)-time algorithm for node-deletion Unique Label Cover with label set Σ (improving the previous bound of O*(|Σ|O(k2 log k) due to Chitnis et al., 2012) and an O*(4k)-time algorithm for Group Feedback Vertex Set, including the setting where the group is only given by oracle access (improving on the previous bound of O*(2O(k log k)) due to Cygan et al., 2012). The latter bound is optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. The latter result also implies the first single-exponential time FPT algorithm for Subset Feedback Vertex Set, answering an open question of Cygan et al. (2012).#R##N##R##N#Interestingly, despite the half-integrality, our result do not imply any approximation results (as may be expected, given the Unique Games-hardness of the covered problems)."
2651459,15514,23684,Better approximation algorithms for the graph diameter,2014,"The diameter is a fundamental graph parameter and its computation is necessary in many applications. The fastest known way to compute the diameter exactly is to solve the All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem.#R##N##R##N#In the absence of fast algorithms, attempts were made to seek fast algorithms that approximate the diameter. In a seminal result Aingworth, Chekuri, Indyk and Motwani [SODA'96 and SICOMP'99] designed an algorithm that computes in O (n2 + m√n) time an estimate D for the diameter D in directed graphs with nonnegative edge weights, such that [EQUATION], where M is the maximum edge weight in the graph. In recent work, Roditty and Vassilevska W. [STOC 13] gave a Las Vegas algorithm that has the same approximation guarantee but improves the (expected) runtime to O (m√n). Roditty and Vassilevska W. also showed that unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, no O (n2-e) time algorithm for sparse unweighted undirected graphs can achieve an approximation ratio better than 3/2. Thus their algorithm is essentially tight for sparse unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs however, the approximation guarantee can be meaningless, as M can be arbitrarily large.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we exhibit two algorithms that achieve a genuine 3/2-approximation for the diameter, one running in O (m3/2) time, and one running in O (mn2/3). time. Furthermore, our algorithms are deterministic, and thus we present the first deterministic (2 -- e)-approximation algorithm for the diameter that takes subquadratic time in sparse graphs.#R##N##R##N#In addition, we address the question of obtaining an additive c-approximation for the diameter, i.e. an estimate D such that D -- c ≤ D ≤ D. An extremely simple O (mn1-e) time algorithm achieves an additive ne-approximation; no better results are known. We show that for any e > 0, getting an additive ne-approximation algorithm for the diameter running in O (n2-e) time for any δ > 2e would falsify the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. Thus the simple algorithm is probably essentially tight for sparse graphs, and moreover, obtaining a subquadratic time additive c-approximation for any constant c is unlikely.#R##N##R##N#Finally, we consider the problem of computing the eccentricities of all vertices in an undirected graph, i.e. the largest distance from each vertex. Roditty and Vassilevska W. [STOC 13] show that in O (m√n) time, one can compute for each v e V in an undirected graph, an estimate e(v) for the eccentricity e (v) such that max{R, 2/3 · e(v)} ≤ e (v) ≤ min {D, 3/2 · e(v)} where R = minv e (v) is the radius of the graph. Here we improve the approximation guarantee by showing that a variant of the same algorithm can achieve estimates e' (v) with 3/5 · e (v) ≤ e' (v) ≤ e (v)."
294057,15514,23684,Annotations for sparse data streams,2014,"Motivated by the surging popularity of commercial cloud computing services, a number of recent works have studied annotated data streams and variants thereof. In this setting, a computationally weak verifier (cloud user), lacking the resources to store and manipulate his massive input locally, accesses a powerful but untrusted prover (cloud service). The verifier must work within the restrictive data streaming paradigm. The prover, who can annotate the data stream as it is read, must not just supply the final answer but also convince the verifier of its correctness. Ideally, both the amount of annotation from the prover and the space used by the verifier should be sublinear in the relevant input size parameters.#R##N##R##N#A rich theory of such algorithms---which we call schemes---has started to emerge. Prior work has shown how to leverage the prover's power to efficiently solve problems that have no non-trivial standard data stream algorithms. However, even though optimal schemes are now known for several basic problems, such optimality holds only for streams whose length is commensurate with the size of the data universe. In contrast, many real-world data sets are relatively sparse, including graphs that contain only o(n2) edges, and IP traffic streams that contain much fewer than the total number of possible IP addresses, 2128 in IPv6.#R##N##R##N#Here we design the first annotation schemes that allow both the annotation and the space usage to be sublinear in the total number of stream updates rather than the size of the data universe. We solve significant problems, including variations of INDEX, SET-DISJOINTNESS, and FREQUENCY-MOMENTS, plus several natural problems on graphs. On the other hand, we give a new lower bound that, for the first time, rules out smooth tradeoffs between annotation and space usage for a specific problem. Our technique brings out new nuances in Merlin--Arthur communication complexity models, and provides a separation between online versions of the MA and AMA models."
2474791,15514,23735,Real-time estimate of period derivatives using adaptive oscillators: Application to impedance-based walking assistance,2012,"Inferring temporal derivatives (like velocity and acceleration) from a noisy position signal is a well-known challenge in control engineering, due to the intrinsic trade-off between noise filtering and estimation bandwidth. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a new approach specifically designed for periodic movements. This approach uses an adaptive oscillator as fundamental building block. It is a tool capable of synchronizing to a periodic input while learning its features (frequency, amplitude, …) in dedicated state variables. Since the oscillator's input and output are perfectly synchronized during steady-state regime, a non-delayed estimate of the input temporal derivatives can be obtained simply by deriving the output analytical form. Pending a (quasi-)periodic input signal, these temporal derivatives are thus synchronized with the actual kinematics, while the signal bandwidth can be arbitrarily tuned by the intrinsic dynamics of the oscillator. We further validate this approach by developing an impedance-based strategy for assisting human walking in the LOPES lower-limb exoskeleton. Preliminary results with a single participant give rise to three main conclusions. First, our method indeed provides velocity and acceleration estimates of the participant's joint kinematics which are smoother and less delayed with respect to the actual kinematics than using a standard Kalman filter. Second, closing the human-robot loop with a high-gain impedance field depending on the acceleration is not possible with a Kalman filter approach, due to unstable dynamics. In contrast, our approach tolerates high gains (up to 70% of the nominal walking torque), showing its intrinsic stability. Finally, no clear benefit of the acceleration-dependent field with respect to a simpler position-dependent field is visible regarding the reduction of metabolic cost. This last result illustrates the challenge of designing sound assistive strategies for complex tasks like walking."

Most commonly, such models are acquired by using range sensors producing point clouds, and further processing steps are required for the construction of a surface model. We used a mobile lidar to map several kilometers of a natural cave system in order to obtain 3D volumetric models for use in scientific research studying the local palaeo-climatic record. For unstructured and GPS-denied environments, such as cave systems, the process of acquiring a complete map is difficult and further complicated by limited mobility within the cave. During the mapping process, many unwanted measurements occur due to occlusions from moving objects such as other people present in the cave. Most common point cloud surface reconstruction techniques are not designed to deal these occlusions; i.e., they require manual cleanup of the data set or are not capable of generating watertight surfaces. The large scale of the environments introduces the additional challenge of dealing with memory limitations. We propose a new volume-based approach to reconstruct a watertight surface from range measurements of enclosed environments without limitation on the scale of the collected data. Our approach carves all unoccupied voxels from the sensor to a triangulated and rasterized surface between successive scans, which is intended to fill in the missing data between the scan rays. The surface is then constructed from the isosurface between unoccupied and unknown cells. By decomposing the space, we are able to handle large-scale data without exceeding the memory limitation of a standard PC, at the cost of some additional computation time. The algorithm has been evaluated across several datasets within a variety of environments and observed to build more complete volumetric models than a simple space carving approach. We have mapped several kilometers of cave networks and, with the described method, produced watertight reconstructions suitable for further scientific analysis."
832117,15514,23735,A Representation Method Based on the Probability of Collision for Safe Robot Navigation in Domestic Environments,2014,"This paper introduces a three-dimensional volu- metric representation for safe navigation. It is based on the OctoMap representation framework that probabilistically fuses sensor measurements to represent the occupancy probability of volumes. To achieve safe navigation in a domestic environment this representation is extended with a model of the occupancy probability if no sensor measurements are received, and a proactive approach to deal with unpredictably moving obstacles that can arise from behind occlusions by always expecting obstacles to appear on the robot's path. By combining the occupancy probability of volumes with the position uncertainty of the robot, a probability of collision is obtained. It is shown that by relating this probability to a safe velocity limit a robot in a real domestic environment can move close to a certain maximum velocity but decides to attain a slower safe velocity limit when it must, analogous to velocity limits and warning signs in traffic. I. INTRODUCTION Robots that navigate in indoor, domestic environments face an environment that encompasses obstacles and uncer- tainties. Obstacles generally vary in their size and shape and can be static as well as dynamic. Uncertainty typically arises from three sources (1): (i) sensing uncertainty due to noisy and false sensor measurements, (ii) uncertainty about the environment due to (partially) unknown parts of that environment and (iii) robot position uncertainty due to localization errors and external disturbances acting on the robot. In the presence of these characteristics a robot always needs to guarantee that it is safe, i.e., that it can ensure to come to a timely stop when a collision is imminent. Safe navigation can be achieved by moving a robot at very low velocities, typically below 0.1 m/s. However, by incorporating knowledge on the environment a robot can move with higher velocities without becoming unsafe. Approaches to safe navigation in a domestic environment generally consist of a motion planner that represents the environment and searches and executes a path through this represented environment. A representation of the environ- ment that is three-dimensional is a prerequisite to deal with the challenges that a typical domestic environment poses (2). Approximate cell decompositions are a common and popular approach to manage this representation (3), (4). Searching and executing a path in an environment with obstacles and uncertainties is typically achieved using a planner that finds"
812719,15514,23684,Dimensionality reduction: beyond the Johnson-Lindenstrauss bound,2011,"Dimension reduction of metric data has become a useful technique with numerous applications. The celebrated Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma states that any  n -point subset of Euclidean space can be embedded in  O (e −2  log  n )-dimension with (1 + e)-distortion. This bound is known to be nearly tight.   In many applications the demand that all distances should be nearly preserved is too strong. In this paper we show that indeed under natural relaxations of the goal of the embedding, an improved dimension reduction is possible where the target dimension is independent of  n . Our main result can be viewed as a  local dimension reduction . There are a variety of empirical situations in which small distances are meaningful and reliable, but larger ones are not. Such situations arise in source coding, image processing, computational biology, and other applications, and are the motivation for widely-used heuristics such as Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding.   Pursuing a line of work begun by Whitney, Nash showed that every  C  1  manifold of dimension  d  can be embedded in R 2 d +2  in such a manner that the local structure at each point is preserved isometrically. Our work is an analog of Nash's for discrete subsets of Euclidean space. For perfect preservation of infinitesimal neighborhoods we substitute near-isometric embedding of neighborhoods of bounded cardinality.   We show that any finite subset of Euclidean space can be embedded in  O (e −2  log  k )-dimension while preserving with (1 + e)-distortion the distances within a core neighborhood of each point. (The core neighborhood is a metric ball around the point, whose radius is a substantial fraction of the radius of the ball of cardinality  k , the  k -neighborhood.) When the metric space satisfies a weak growth rate property, the guarantee applies to the entire  k -neighborhood (with some dependency of the embedding dimension on the growth rate). We also show how to obtain a global embedding that also keeps distant points well-separated (at the cost of dependency on the doubling dimension of the space).   As an application of our methods we obtain an (Assouad-style) dimension reduction for finite subsets of Euclidean space where the metric is raised to some fractional power (the resulting metrics are known as snowflakes). We show that any such metric X can be embedded in dimension  O (e −3  dim( X )) with 1 + e distortion, where dim( X ) is the doubling dimension, a measure of the intrinsic dimension of the set. This result improves recent work by Gottlieb and Krauthgamer [20] to a nearly tight bound.   The new dimension reduction results are useful for applications such as clustering and distance labeling."
2100732,15514,23634,On-Line Indexing for General Alphabets via Predecessor Queries on Subsets of an Ordered List,2012,"The problem of \textit{Text Indexing} is a fundamental algorithmic problem in which one wishes to preprocess a text in order to quickly locate pattern queries within the text. In the ever evolving world of dynamic and on-line data, there is also a need for developing solutions to index texts which arrive on-line, i.e.~a character at a time, and still be able to quickly locate said patterns. In this paper, a new solution for on-line indexing is presented by providing an on-line suffix tree construction in $O(\log \log n + \log\log |\Sigma|)$ worst-case expected time per character, where $n$ is the size of the string, and $\Sigma$ is the alphabet. This improves upon all previously known on-line suffix tree constructions for general alphabets, at the cost of having the run time in expectation. The main idea is to reduce the problem of constructing a suffix tree on-line to an interesting variant of the order maintenance problem, which may be of independent interest. In the famous order maintenance problem, one wishes to maintain a dynamic list $L$ of size $n$ under insertions, deletions, and order queries. In an order query, one is given two nodes from $L$ and must determine which node precedes the other in $L$. In an extension to this problem, named the {\em Predecessor search on Dynamic Subsets of an Ordered Dynamic List problem} (POLP for short), it is also necessary to maintain dynamic subsets $S_1, \cdots, S_k\subseteq L$, such that given some $u\in L$ it will be possible to quickly locate the predecessor of $u$ in $S_i$, for any integer $1\leq i \leq k$. This paper provides an efficient data structure capable of locating the predecessor of $u$ in $S_i$ in $O(\log \log n)$ worst-case time and answering order queries on $L$ in $O(1)$ worst-case time, while allowing updates to $L$ in $O(1)$ worst-case expected time and updates to the subsets in $O(\log \log n)$ worst-case expected time. This improves over a previous data structure which may be implicitly obtained from Dietz~\cite{Dietz89}, in which the updates to the sets and $L$ are done in $O(\log \log n)$ \textit{amortized} expected time. In addition, the bounds shown here match the currently best known bounds for predecessor search in the RAM model. Furthermore, this paper improves or simplifies bounds for several additional applications, including fully-persistent arrays, the monotonic list labeling problem, and the Order-Maintenance Problem."
595546,15514,23634,"Lasserre Hierarchy, Higher Eigenvalues, and Approximation Schemes for Graph Partitioning and Quadratic Integer Programming with PSD Objectives",2011,"We present an approximation scheme for optimizing certain Quadratic Integer Programming problems with positive semi definite objective functions and global linear constraints. This framework includes well known graph problems such as Minimum graph bisection, Edge expansion, Uniform sparsest cut, and Small Set expansion, as well as the Unique Games problem. These problems are notorious for the existence of huge gaps between the known algorithmic results and NP-hardness results. Our algorithm is based on rounding semi definite programs from the Lasserre hierarchy, and the analysis uses bounds for low-rank approximations of a matrix in Frobenius norm using columns of the matrix. For all the above graph problems, we give an algorithm running in time $n^{O(r/\eps^2)}$ with approximation ratio $\frac{1+\eps}{\min\{1,\lambda_r\}}$, where $\lambda_r$ is the $r$'th smallest eigenvalue of the normalized graph Laplacian $\Lnorm$. In the case of graph bisection and small set expansion, the number of vertices in the cut is within lower-order terms of the stipulated bound. Our results imply $(1+O(\eps))$ factor approximation in time $n^{O(r^\ast/\eps^2)}$ where $r^\ast$ is the number of eigenvalues of $\Lnorm$ smaller than $1-\eps$. This perhaps gives some indication as to why even showing mere APX-hardness for these problems has been elusive, since the reduction must produce graphs with a slowly growing spectrum (and classes like planar graphs which are known to have such a spectral property often admit good algorithms owing to their nice structure). For Unique Games, we give a factor $(1+\frac{2+\eps}{\lambda_r})$ approximation for minimizing the number of unsatisfied constraints in $n^{O(r/\eps)}$ time. This improves an earlier bound for solving Unique Games on expanders, and also shows that Lasserre SDPs are powerful enough to solve well-known integrality gap instances for the basic SDP. We also give an algorithm for independent sets in graphs that performs well when the Laplacian does not have too many eigenvalues bigger than $1+o(1)$."
661696,15514,23684,A QPTAS for maximum weight independent set of polygons with polylogarithmically many vertices,2014,"The Maximum Weight Independent Set of Polygons (MWISP) problem is a fundamental problem in computational geometry. Given a set of weighted polygons in the two-dimensional plane, the goal is to find a set of pairwise non-overlapping polygons with maximum total weight. Due to its wide range of applications and connections to other problems, the MWISP problem and its special cases have been extensively studied both in the approximation algorithms and the computational geometry community. Despite a lot of research, its general case is not well-understood yet. Currently the best known polynomial time algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of ne, and it is not even clear whether the problem is APX-hard. We present a (1 + e)-approximation algorithm, assuming that each polygon in the input has at most a polylogarithmic number of vertices. Our algorithm has quasi-polynomial running time, i.e., it runs in time 2poly(log n, 1/e). In particular, our result implies that for this setting the problem is not APX-hard, unless NP ⊆ DTIME(2poly(log n)).#R##N##R##N#We use a recently introduced framework for approximating maximum weight independent set in geometric intersection graphs. The framework has been used to construct a QPTAS in the much simpler case of axis-parallel rectangles. We extend it in two ways, to adapt it to our much more general setting. First, we show that its technical core can be reduced to the case when all input polygons are triangles. Secondly, we replace its key technical ingredient which is a method to partition the plane using only few edges such that the objects stemming from the optimal solution are evenly distributed among the resulting faces and each object is intersected only a few times. Our new procedure for this task is no more complicated than the original one and, importantly, it can handle the difficulties arising from the arbitrary angles of the input polygons. Note that already this obstacle makes the known analysis for the above framework fail. Also, in general it is not well understood how to handle this difficulty by efficient approximation algorithms."
1728402,15514,23634,"Independent Set, Induced Matching, and Pricing: Connections and Tight (Subexponential Time) Approximation Hardnesses",2013,"We present a series of almost settled inapproximability results for three fundamental problems. The first in our series is the subexponential-time inapproximability of the independent set problem, a question studied in the area of parameterized complexity. The second is the hardness of approximating the bipartite induced matching problem on bounded-degree bipartite graphs. The last in our series is the tight hardness of approximating the k-hypergraph pricing problem, a fundamental problem arising from the area of algorithmic game theory. In particular, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, our two main results are: For any r larger than some constant, any r-approximation algorithm for the independent set problem must run in at least 2n 1-e/ r 1+e  time. This nearly matches the upper bound of 2 n/r  [23]. It also improves some hardness results in the domain of parameterized complexity (e.g., [26], [19]). For any k larger than some constant, there is no polynomial time min{k 1-e , n 1/2-e } time min -approximation algorithm for the k-hypergraph pricing problem , where n is the number of vertices in an input graph. This almost matches the upper bound of min{O(k), Õ(√n) } min (by Balcan and Blum [3] and an algorithm in this paper). We note an interesting fact that, in contrast to n 1/2-e  hardness for polynomial-time algorithms, the k-hypergraph pricing problem admits n δ  approximation for any δ > 0 in quasi-polynomial time. This puts this problem in a rare approximability class in which approximability thresholds can be improved significantly by allowing algorithms to run in quasi-polynomial time. The proofs of our hardness results rely on unexpectedly tight connections between the three problems. First, we establish a connection between the first and second problems by proving a new graph-theoretic property related to an induced matching number of dispersers. Then, we show that the n 1/2-e  hardness of the last problem follows from nearly tight subexponential time inapproximability of the first problem, illustrating a rare application of the second type of inapproximability result to the first one. Finally, to prove the subexponential-time inapproximability of the first problem, we construct a new PCP with several properties; it is sparse and has nearly-linear size, large degree, and small free-bit complexity. Our PCP requires no ground-breaking ideas but rather a very careful assembly of the existing ingredients in the PCP literature."
1292493,15514,23735,Cooperative human robot interaction systems: IV. Communication of shared plans with Naïve humans using gaze and speech,2013,"Cooperation 1  is at the core of human social life. In this context, two major challenges face research on humanrobot interaction: the first is to understand the underlying structure of cooperation, and the second is to build, based on this understanding, artificial agents that can successfully and safely interact with humans. Here we take a psychologically grounded and human-centered approach that addresses these two challenges. We test the hypothesis that optimal cooperation between a naïve human and a robot requires that the robot can acquire and execute a joint plan, and that it communicates this joint plan through ecologically valid modalities including spoken language, gesture and gaze. We developed a cognitive system that comprises the human-like control of social actions, the ability to acquire and express shared plans and a spoken language stage. In order to test the psychological validity of our approach we tested 12 naïve subjects in a cooperative task with the robot. We experimentally manipulated the presence of a joint plan (vs. a solo plan), the use of task-oriented gaze and gestures, and the use of language accompanying the unfolding plan. The quality of cooperation was analyzed in terms of proper turn taking, collisions and cognitive errors. Results showed that while successful turn taking could take place in the absence of the explicit use of a joint plan, its presence yielded significantly greater success. One advantage of the solo plan was that the robot would always be ready to generate actions, and could thus adapt if the human intervened at the wrong time, whereas in the joint plan the robot expected the human to take his/her turn. Interestingly, when the robot represented the action as involving a joint plan, gaze provided a highly potent nonverbal cue that facilitated successful collaboration and reduced errors in the absence of verbal communication. These results support the cooperative stance in human social cognition, and suggest that cooperative robots should employ joint plans, fully communicate them in order to sustain effective collaboration while being ready to adapt if the human makes a midstream mistake."
2294186,15514,23634,Quasipolynomial-Time Identity Testing of Non-commutative and Read-Once Oblivious Algebraic Branching Programs,2013,"We study the problem of obtaining efficient, deterministic, black-box polynomial identity testing algorithms (PIT) for algebraic branching programs (ABPs) that are read-once and oblivious. This class has an efficient, deterministic, white-box polynomial identity testing algorithm (due to Raz and Shpilka), but prior to this work there was no known such black-box algorithm. The main result of this work gives the first quasi-polynomial sized hitting sets for size S circuits from this class, when the order of the variables is known. As our hitting set is of size exp(lg 2  S), this is analogous (in the terminology of boolean pseudorandom ness) to a seed-length of lg 2  S, which is the seed length of the pseudorandom generators of Nisan and Impagliazzo-Nisan-Wigderson for read-once oblivious boolean branching programs. Thus our work can be seen as an algebraic analogue of these foundational results in boolean pseudorandom ness. Our results are stronger for branching programs of bounded width, where we give a hitting set of size exp(lg 2  S/lglg S), corresponding to a seed length of lg 2  S/lglg S. This is in stark contrast to the known results for read-once oblivious boolean branching programs of bounded width, where no pseudorandom generator (or hitting set) with seed length o(lg 2  S) is known. Thus, while our work is in some sense an algebraic analogue of existing boolean results, the two regimes seem to have non-trivial differences. In follow up work, we strengthened a result of Mulmuley, and showed that derandomizing a particular case of the No ether Normalization Lemma is reducible to black-box PIT of read-once oblivious ABPs. Using the results of the present work, this gives a derandomization of No ether Normalization in that case, which Mulmuley conjectured would difficult due to its relations to problems in algebraic geometry. We also show that several other circuit classes can be black-box reduced to read-once oblivious ABPs, including set-multilinear ABPs (a generalization of depth-3 set-multilinear formulas), non-commutative ABPs (generalizing non-commutative formulas), and (semi-)diagonal depth-4 circuits (as introduced by Saxena). For set-multilinear ABPs and non-commutative ABPs, we give quasi-polynomial-time black-box PIT algorithms, where the latter case involves evaluations over the algebra of (D+1)x(D+1) matrices, where D is the depth of the ABP. For (semi-)diagonal depth-4 circuits, we obtain a black-box PIT algorithm (over any characteristic) whose run-time is quasi-polynomial in the runtime of Saxena's white-box algorithm, matching the concurrent work of Agrawal, Saha, and Saxena. Finally, by combining our results with the reconstruction algorithm of Klivans and Shpilka, we obtain deterministic reconstruction algorithms for the above circuit classes."
2081461,15514,20774,Near-optimal scheduling mechanisms for deadline-sensitive jobs in large computing clusters,2012,"We consider a market-based resource allocation model for batch jobs in cloud computing clusters. In our model, we incorporate the importance of the due date of a job rather than the number of servers allocated to it at any given time. Each batch job is characterized by the work volume of total computing units (e.g., CPU hours) along with a bound on maximum degree of parallelism. Users specify, along with these job characteristics, their desired due date and a value for finishing the job by its deadline. Given this specification, the primary goal is to determine the  scheduling } of cloud computing instances under capacity constraints in order to maximize the social welfare (i.e., sum of values gained by allocated users). Our main result is a new ( C/(C-k) ⋅ s/(s-1))-approximation algorithm for this objective, where C denotes cloud capacity, k is the maximal bound on parallelized execution (in practical settings, k l C) and s is the slackness on the job completion time i.e., the minimal ratio between a specified deadline and the earliest finish time of a job. Our algorithm is based on utilizing dual fitting arguments over a strengthened linear program to the problem.   Based on the new approximation algorithm, we construct truthful allocation and pricing mechanisms, in which reporting the job true value and properties (deadline, work volume and the parallelism bound) is a dominant strategy for all users. To that end, we provide a general framework for transforming allocation algorithms into truthful mechanisms in domains of single-value and multi-properties. We then show that the basic mechanism can be extended under proper Bayesian assumptions to the objective of maximizing revenues, which is important for public clouds. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our approach through simulations on data-center job traces, and show that the revenues obtained under our mechanism are comparable with an  ideal  fixed-price mechanism, which sets an on-demand price using oracle knowledge of users' valuations. Finally, we discuss how our model can be extended to accommodate uncertainties in job work volumes, which is a practical challenge in cloud settings."
554084,15514,23684,On the communication and streaming complexity of maximum bipartite matching,2012,"Consider the following communication problem. Alice holds a graph GA = (P,Q,EA) and Bob holds a graph GB = (P,Q,EB), where |P| = |Q| = n. Alice is allowed to send Bob a message m that depends only on the graph GA. Bob must then output a matching M ⊆ EA ∪ EB. What is the minimum message size of the message m that Alice sends to Bob that allows Bob to recover a matching of size at least (1 − e) times the maximum matching in GA ∪ GB? The minimum message length is the one-round communication complexity of approximating bipartite matching. It is easy to see that the one-round communication complexity also gives a lower bound on the space needed by a one-pass streaming algorithm to compute a (1 − e)-approximate bipartite matching. The focus of this work is to understand one-round communication complexity and one-pass streaming complexity of maximum bipartite matching. In particular, how well can one approximate these problems with linear communication and space? Prior to our work, only a 1/2-approximation was known for both these problems.#R##N##R##N#In order to study these questions, we introduce the concept of an e-matching cover of a bipartite graph G, which is a sparse subgraph of the original graph that preserves the size of maximum matching between every subset of vertices to within an additive en error. We give a polynomial time construction of a 1/2-matching cover of size O(n) with some crucial additional properties, thereby showing that Alice and Bob can achieve a 2/3-approximation with a message of size O(n). While we do not provide bounds on the size of e-matching covers for e   0, a (2/3 + δ)-approximation requires a communication complexity of n1+Ω(1/log log n).#R##N##R##N#We also consider the natural restrictingon of the problem in which GA and GB are only allowed to share vertices on one side of the bipartition, which is motivated by applications to one-pass streaming with vertex arrivals. We show that a 3/4-approximation can be achieved with a linear size message in this case, and this result is best possible in that super-linear space is needed to achieve any better approximation.#R##N##R##N#Finally, we build on our techniques for the restricted version above to design one-pass streaming algorithm for the case when vertices on one side are known in advance, and the vertices on the other side arrive in a streaming manner together with all their incident edges. This is precisely the setting of the celebrated (1 − 1/e)-competitive randomized algorithm of Karp-Vazirani-Vazirani (KVV) for the online bipartite matching problem [12]. We present here the first deterministic one-pass streaming (1 - 1/e)-approximation algorithm using O(n) space for this setting."
2061868,15514,23735,Optimal control of multi-input SMA actuator arrays using graph theory: Expanding wavefront & simultaneous operations,2011,"Shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators are compact and have high force-to-weight ratios, making them strong candidates to actuate robots, exoskeletons, and prosthetics. However, these actuators are thermomechanical in nature and slow cooling rates can limit their performance. To improve the convective cooling, SMA wires have been embedded in vascular networks allowing cold fluid to pass across the actuators to cool/extend them. The vascular network can also deliver hot fluid to heat and contract the wire. In addition to the fluidic network, an electrical network operating in parallel can resistively heat the SMA to produce contraction. To minimize the weight and size of the vascular and electrical networks, a scalable N×N architecture has been implemented that allows for 2N control devices (valves, transistors) to be shared amongst N 2  actuators. This Network Array Architecture (NAA) allows each actuator to be controlled individually or in discrete subarrays. However, this architecture does not allow all combinations of actuators to be activated simultaneously; therefore in general a sequence of control commands will need to be executed in order to achieve the complete actuation. In order to find an optimal sequence of control commands, graph theory algorithms have been implemented. By treating each actuator's state as binary (fully contracted or extended), the collected states of an actuator array can be represented as nodes of the graph and the control commands as the graph edges. By properly weighting the costs of the graph edges, search algorithms can be used to find an optimal set of control commands for desired state changes. NAA results in a multigraph that has 2 N×N  nodes and is highly interconnected. While initial work in this area established the basic validity of a graph search approach for NAA control, this article presents a scalable method of determining the optimal set of controls to minimize the operating cost (time and energy) and computational search cost."
946159,15514,23634,Representative Sets and Irrelevant Vertices: New Tools for Kernelization,2012,"The existence of a polynomial kernel for Odd Cycle Transversal was a notorious open problem in parameterized complexity. Recently, this was settled by the present authors (Kratsch and Wahlstr\om, SODA 2012), with a randomized polynomial kernel for the problem, using matroid theory to encode flow questions over a set of terminals in size polynomial in the number of terminals (rather than the total graph size, which may be superpolynomially larger). In the current work we further establish the usefulness of matroid theory to kernelization by showing applications of a result on representative sets due to Lov\'asz (Combinatorial Surveys 1977) and Marx (TCS 2009). We show how representative sets can be used to give a polynomial kernel for the elusive Almost 2-sat problem (where the task is to remove at most k clauses to make a 2-CNF formula satisfiable), solving a major open problem in kernelization. We further apply the representative sets tool to the problem of finding irrelevant vertices in graph cut problems, that is, vertices which can be made undeletable without affecting the status of the problem. This gives the first significant progress towards a polynomial kernel for the Multiway Cut problem, in particular, we get a polynomial kernel for Multiway Cut instances with a bounded number of terminals. Both these kernelization results have significant spin-off effects, producing the first polynomial kernels for a range of related problems. More generally, the irrelevant vertex results have implications for covering min-cuts in graphs. In particular, given a directed graph and a set of terminals, we can find a set of size polynomial in the number of terminals (a cut-covering set) which contains a minimum vertex cut for every choice of sources and sinks from the terminal set. Similarly, given an undirected graph and a set of terminals, we can find a set of vertices, of size polynomial in the number of terminals, which contains a minimum multiway cut for every partition of the terminals into a bounded number of sets. Both results are polynomial time. We expect this to have further applications, in particular, we get direct, reduction rule-based kernelizations for all problems above, in contrast to the indirect compression-based kernel previously given for Odd Cycle Transversal. All our results are randomized, with failure probabilities which can be made exponentially small in the size of the input, due to needing a representation of a matroid to apply the representative sets tool."
742367,15514,11330,Input-adaptive parallel sparse fast fourier transform for stream processing,2014,"Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is frequently invoked in stream processing, e.g., calculating the spectral representation of audio/video frames, and in many cases the inputs are sparse, i.e., most of the inputs' Fourier coefficients being zero. Many sparse FFT algorithms have been proposed to improve FFT's efficiency when inputs are known to be sparse. However, like their dense counterparts, existing sparse FFT implementations are input oblivious in the sense that how the algorithms work is not affected by the value of input. The sparse FFT computation on one frame is exactly the same as the computation on the next frame. This paper improves upon existing sparse FFT algorithms by simultaneously exploiting the input sparsity and the similarity between adjacent inputs in stream processing. Our algorithm detects and takes advantage of the similarity between input samples to automatically design and customize sparse filters that lead to better parallelism and performance. More specifically, we develop an efficient heuristic to detect the similarity between the current input to its predecessor in stream processing, and when it is found to be similar, we novelly use the spectral representation of the predecessor to accelerate the sparse FFT computation on the current input. Given a sparse signal that has only $k$ non-zero Fourier coefficients, our algorithm utilizes sparse approximation by tuning several adaptive filters to efficiently package the non-zero Fourier coefficients into a small number of bins which can then be estimated accurately. Therefore, our algorithm has runtime sub-linear to the input size and gets rid of recursive coefficient estimation, both of which improve parallelism and performance. Furthermore, the new heuristic can detect the discontinuities inside the streams and resumes the input adaptation very quickly. We evaluate our input-adaptive sparse FFT implementation on Intel i7 CPU and three NVIDIA GPUs, i.e., NVIDIA GeForce GTX480, Tesla C2070 and Tesla C2075. Our algorithm is faster than previous FFT implementations both in theory and implementation. For inputs with size N=2^{24}, our parallel implementation outperforms FFTW for k up to 2^{18}, which is an order of magnitude higher than prior sparse algorithms. Furthermore, our input adaptive sparse FFT on Tesla C2075 GPU achieves up to 77.2x and 29.3x speedups over 1-thread and 4-thread FFTW, 10.7x, 6.4x, 5.2x speedups against sFFT 1.0, sFFT 2.0, CUFFT, and 6.9x speedup over our sequential CPU performance, respectively."

Standard results in compressive sensing show that it is possible to recover the signal x from m = O(k log(n/k)) measurements, and that this bound is tight. The framework of model-based compressive sensing [BCDH10] overcomes the lower bound and reduces the number of measurements further to O(k) by limiting the supports of x to a subset M of the (nk) possible supports. This has led to many measurement-efficient algorithms for a wide variety of signal models, including block-sparsity and tree-sparsity.#R##N##R##N#Unfortunately, extending the framework to other, more general models has been stymied by the following obstacle: for the framework to apply, one needs an algorithm that, given a signal x, solves the following optimization problem exactly:#R##N##R##N#[EQUATION]#R##N##R##N#(here x[n]\Ω denotes the projection of x on coordinates not in Ω).

2335187,15514,23735,"Towards a platform-independent cooperative human-robot interaction system: II. Perception, execution and imitation of goal directed actions",2011,"If robots are to cooperate with humans in an increasingly human-like manner, then significant progress must be made in their abilities to observe and learn to perform novel goal directed actions in a flexible and adaptive manner. The current research addresses this challenge. In CHRIS.I [1], we developed a platform-independent perceptual system that learns from observation to recognize human actions in a way which abstracted from the specifics of the robotic platform, learning actions including “put X on Y” and “take X”. In the current research, we extend this system from action perception to execution, consistent with current developmental research in human understanding of goal directed action and teleological reasoning. We demonstrate the platform independence with experiments on three different robots. In Experiments 1 and 2 we complete our previous study of perception of actions “put” and “take” demonstrating how the system learns to execute these same actions, along with new related actions “cover” and “uncover” based on the composition of action primitives “grasp X” and “release X at Y”. Significantly, these compositional action execution specifications learned on one iCub robot are then executed on another, based on the abstraction layer of motor primitives. Experiment 3 further validates the platform-independence of the system, as a new action that is learned on the iCub in Lyon is then executed on the Jido robot in Toulouse. In Experiment 4 we extended the definition of action perception to include the notion of agency, again inspired by developmental studies of agency attribution, exploiting the Kinect motion capture system for tracking human motion. Finally in Experiment 5 we demonstrate how the combined representation of action in terms of perception and execution provides the basis for imitation. This provides the basis for an open ended cooperation capability where new actions can be learned and integrated into shared plans for cooperation. Part of the novelty of this research is the robots' use of spoken language understanding and visual perception to generate action representations in a platform independent manner based on physical state changes. This provides a flexible capability for goal-directed action imitation."
484610,15514,23684,Space efficient streaming algorithms for the distance to monotonicity and asymmetric edit distance,2013,"Approximating the length of the longest increasing sequence (LIS) of an array is a well-studied problem. We study this problem in the data stream model, where the algorithm is allowed to make a single left-to-right pass through the array and the key resource to be minimized is the amount of additional memory used. We present an algorithm which, for any δ > 0, given streaming access to an array of length n provides a (1 + δ)-multiplicative approximation to the distance to monotonicity (n minus the length of the LIS), and uses only O((log2 n)/δ) space. The previous best known approximation using polylogarithmic space was a multiplicative 2-factor. The improved approximation factor reflects a qualitative difference between our algorithm and previous algorithms: previous polylogarithmic space algorithms could not reliably detect increasing subsequences of length as large as n/2, while ours can detect increasing subsequences of length βn for any β > 0. More precisely, our algorithm can be used to estimate the length of the LIS to within an additive δn for any δ > 0 while previous algorithms could only achieve additive error n(1/2 -- o(1)).#R##N##R##N#Our algorithm is very simple, being just 3 lines of pseudocode, and has a small update time.

For example, we give a streaming algorithm for approximating LCS(x, y), the length of the longest common subsequence between strings x and y, each of length n. Our algorithm works in the asymmetric setting (inspired by [AKO10]), in which we have random access to y and streaming access to x, and runs in small space provided that no single symbol appears very often in y. More precisely, it gives an additive-δn approximation to LCS(x, y) (and hence also to E(x, y) = n -- LCS(x, y), the edit distance between x and y when insertions and deletions, but not substitutions, are allowed), with space complexity O(k(log2 n)/δ), where k is the maximum number of times any one symbol appears in y.#R##N##R##N#We also provide a deterministic 1-pass streaming algorithm that outputs a (1 + δ)-multiplicative approximation for E(x, y) (which is also an additive δn-approximation), in the asymmetric setting, and uses O(√n/δ log(n)) space.

920362,15514,23634,Network Sparsification for Steiner Problems on Planar and Bounded-Genus Graphs,2014,"We propose polynomial-time algorithms that sparsify planar and bounded-genus graphs while preserving optimal or near-optimal solutions to Steiner problems. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given an unweighted graph G embedded on a surface of genus g and a designated face f bounded by a simple cycle of length k, uncovers a set F in E(G) of size polynomial in g and k that contains an optimal Steiner tree for any set of terminals that is a subset of the vertices of f. We apply this general theorem to prove that: -- given an unweighted graph G embedded on a surface of genus g and a terminal set S in V(G), one can in polynomial time find a set F in E(G) that contains an optimal Steiner tree T for S and that has size polynomial in g and |E(T)|; -- an analogous result holds for an optimal Steiner forest for a set S of terminal pairs, -- given an unweighted planar graph G and a terminal set S in V(G), one can in polynomial time find a set F in E(G) that contains an optimal (edge) multiway cut C separating S (i.e., a cutset that intersects any path with endpoints in different terminals from S) and has size polynomial in |C|. In the language of parameterized complexity, these results imply the first polynomial kernels for Steiner Tree and Steiner Forest on planar and bounded-genus graphs (parameterized by the size of the tree and forest, respectively) and for (Edge) Multiway Cut on planar graphs (parameterized by the size of the cutset). Steiner Tree and similar subset problems were identified in [Demaine, Hajiaghayi, Computer J., 2008] as important to the quest to widen the reach of the theory of bidimensionality ([Demaine et al., JACM 2005], [Fomin et al., SODA 2010]). Therefore, our results can be seen as a leap forward to achieve this broader goal. Additionally, we obtain a weighted variant of our main contribution: a polynomial-time algorithm that, given an edge-weighted planar graph G, a designated face f bounded by a simple cycle of weight w(f), and an accuracy parameter aepsi; > 0, uncovers a set F in E(G) of total weight at most poly(1/aepsi;) w(f) that, for any set of terminal pairs that lie on f, contains a Steiner forest within additive error aepsi; w(f) from the optimal Steiner forest. This result deepens the understanding of the recent framework of approximation schemes for network design problems on planar graphs ([Klein, SICOMP 2008], [Borradaile, Klein, Mathieu, ACM TALG 2009], and later works) by explaining the structure of the solution space within a brick of the so-called mortar graph -- the central notion of this framework."
2758967,15514,23684,Point line cover: the easy kernel is essentially tight,2014,"The input to the NP-hard Point Line Cover problem (PLC) consists of a set P of n points on the plane and a positive integer k, and the question is whether there exists a set of at most k lines which pass through all points in P. By straightforward reduction rules one can efficiently reduce any input to one with at most k2 points. We show that this easy reduction is already essentially tight under standard assumptions. More precisely, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level, for any e > 0, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that reduces every instance (P, k) of PLC to an equivalent instance with O(k2-e) points. This answers, in the negative, an open problem posed by Lokshtanov (PhD Thesis, 2009).#R##N##R##N#Our proof uses the notion of a kernel from parameterized complexity, and the machinery for deriving lower bounds on the size of kernels developed by Dell and van Melkebeek (STOC 2010). It has two main ingredients: We first show, by reduction from Vertex Cover, that---unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses---PLC has no kernel of total size O(k2-e) bits. This does not directly imply the claimed lower bound on the number of points, since the best known polynomial-time encoding of a PLC instance with n points requires ω(n2) bits. To get around this hurdle we build on work of Goodman, Pollack and Sturmfels (STOC 1989) and devise an oracle communication protocol of cost O(n log n) for PLC; its main building blocks are a bound of O(nO(n)) for the order types of n points that are not necessarily in general position and an explicit (albeit slow) algorithm that enumerates a superset of size nO(n) of all possible order types of n points. This protocol, together with the lower bound on the total size (which also holds for such protocols), yields the stated lower bound on the number of points.#R##N##R##N#While a number of essentially tight polynomial lower bounds on total sizes of kernels are known, our result is---to the best of our knowledge---the first to show a nontrivial lower bound for structural/secondary parameters."
1046839,15514,23735,Towards Valve Turning using a Dual-Arm Aerial Manipulator,2014,"We propose a framework for valve turning using an aerial vehicle endowed with dual multi-degree of freedom manipulators. A tightly integrated control scheme between the aircraft and manipulators is mandated for tasks requiring aircraft to environmental coupling. Feature detection is well- established for both ground and aerial vehicles and facilitates valve detection and arm tracking. Force feedback upon contact with the environment provides compliant motions in the pres- ence of position error and coupling with the valve. We present recent results validating the valve turning framework using the proposed aircraft-arm system during flight tests. I. INTRODUCTION Valve turning represents a classic controls problem along with insertion tasks and tool usage. The ground robotics community has largely solved these problems. There are many examples of door opening, using a drill, assembly of structures, and inserting a power plug by ground vehicles with one or more dexterous arms. Many of these tasks require position and/or force control and typical implementations in- volve force/torque sensing, vision systems, or a combination of these methods. The ground-based system must coordinate the vehicle and arm motions to perform these tasks. While the coupling between the environment (i.e. valve, knob, handle) and robot does influence the vehicle base with added contact forces/torques and friction, the base can typically maintain stability during the entire motion. However, the strong coupling required during valve or knob turning greatly influences the dynamics of an aerial manipulator. Rigidity in the manipulator and the propagation of contact forces when interacting with the environment can cause crashes. There have been recent results where multi-DOF aerial manipulators have experienced coupling with the environment (1)-(4). Other groups have investigated compliance in assembly tasks (5)-(7), or dynamic stability and control w.r.t. center of mass and moment of inertia variations (8)-(10)."
1722869,15514,23735,When shared plans go wrong: From atomic- to composite actions and back,2012,"As elaborate human-robot interaction capabilities continue to develop, humans will increasingly be in proximity with robots, and the management of the ongoing control in case of breakdown becomes increasingly important: taking care of what happens when cooperation goes wrong. The current research addresses three categories of breakdowns where cooperation can go wrong. In the first category, the human detects some type of problem and generates a self-issued stop signal, with a physical palm up posture. In the second category, the human becomes distracted, and physically changes his orientation away from the shared space of cooperation. In the final category that we investigate, the human becomes physically close to the robot such that safety limits are reached and detected by the robot. In each of these three cases, the robot cognitive system detects the failure via the perception of distinct physical states from motion capture: the hand up posture; change in head orientation; and physical distance reaching a minimum threshold. In each case the robot immediately halts the current action. Then, the system should recover appropriately. Each error type returns a specific code, allowing the Supervisor system to handle the specific type of error. Our cognitive system allows the robot to learn composite actions, as a sequence of atomic actions. These composite actions can then be composed into higher level plans. When a plan fails at the level of a composite action, the recovery method is not trivial: should recovery take place at the level of the composite action, or the actual atomic action which physically failed? As the best recovery may depend on the physical context, we expand the plan into atomic actions, and recover at this level, allowing the user to specify whether the action should be skipped or retried. We demonstrate that this system allows graceful recovery from three principal categories of interaction breakdown, and provides an invaluable mechanism for preserving the integrity of cooperative HRI."
2186826,15514,23634,Active Property Testing,2012,"One motivation for property testing of boolean functions is the idea that testing can provide a fast preprocessing step before learning. However, in most machine learning applications, it is not possible to request for labels of arbitrary examples constructed by an algorithm. Instead, the dominant query paradigm in applied machine learning, called *active learning*, is one where the algorithm may query for labels, but only on points in a given (polynomial-sized) unlabeled sample, drawn from some underlying distribution D. In this work, we bring this well-studied model to the domain of testing. We develop both general results for this *active testing* model as well as efficient testing algorithms for several important properties for learning, demonstrating that testing can still yield substantial benefits in this restricted setting. For example, we show that testing unions of d intervals can be done with O(1) label requests in our setting, whereas it is known to require Omega(d) labeled examples for learning (and Omega(sqrt{d}) for passive testing [KR00] where the algorithm must pay for every example drawn from D). In fact, our results for testing unions of intervals also yield improvements on prior work in both the classic query model (where any point in the domain can be queried) and the passive testing model as well. For the problem of testing linear separators in R^n over the Gaussian distribution, we show that both active and passive testing can be done with O(sqrt{n}) queries, substantially less than the Omega(n) needed for learning, with near-matching lower bounds. We also present a general combination result in this model for building testable properties out of others, which we then use to provide testers for a number of assumptions used in semi-supervised learning. In addition to the above results, we also develop a general notion of the *testing dimension* of a given property with respect to a given distribution, that we show characterizes (up to constant factors) the intrinsic number of label requests needed to test that property. We develop such notions for both the active and passive testing models. We then use these dimensions to prove a number of lower bounds, including for linear separators and the class of dictator functions."
2229002,15514,23634,Decremental Single-Source Shortest Paths on Undirected Graphs in Near-Linear Total Update Time,2014,"The decremental single-source shortest paths (SSSP) problem concerns maintaining the distances between a given source node s to every node in an n-node m-edge graph G undergoing edge deletions. While its static counterpart can be easily solved in near-linear time, this decremental problem is much more challenging even in the undirected unweighted case. In this case, the classic O(mn) total update time of Even and Shiloach (JACM 1981) has been the fastest known algorithm for three decades. With the loss of a (1 + aepsi;)-approximation factor, the running time was recently improved to O(n2+o(1)) by Bernstein and Roditty (SODA 2011), and more recently to O(n1.8+o(1) + m1+o(1)) by Henzinger, Krinninger, and Nanongkai (SODA 2014). In this paper, we finally bring the running time of this case down to near-linear: We give a (1 + aepsi;)-approximation algorithm with O(m1+o(1)) total update time, thus obtaining near-linear time. Moreover, we obtain O(m1+o(1)log W) time for the weighted case, where the edge weights are integers from 1 to W. The only prior work on weighted graphs in o(mn log W) time is the O(mn0.986 log W)-time algorithm by Henzinger, Krinninger, and Nanongkai (STOC 2014) which works for the general weighted directed case. In contrast to the previous results which rely on maintaining a sparse emulator, our algorithm relies on maintaining a so-called sparse (d, aepsi;)-hop set introduced by Cohen (JACM 2000) in the PRAM literature. A (d, aepsi;)-hop set of a graph G = (V, E) is a set E' of weighted edges such that the distance between any pair of nodes in G can be (1 + aepsi;)-approximated by their d-hop distance (given by a path containing at most d edges) on G'=(V, E a#x222A; E'). Our algorithm can maintain an (no(1), aepsi;)-hop set of near-linear size in near-linear time under edge deletions. It is the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge. To maintain the distances on this hop set, we develop a monotone bounded-hop Even-Shiloach tree. It results from extending and combining the monotone Even-Shiloach tree of Henzinger, Krinninger, and Nanongkai (FOCS 2013) with the bounded-hop SSSP technique of Bernstein (STOC 2013). These two new tools might be of independent interest."
809687,15514,23634,The Power of Linear Estimators,2011,"For a broad class of practically relevant distribution properties, which includes entropy and support size, nearly all of the proposed estimators have an especially simple form. Given a set of independent samples from a discrete distribution, these estimators tally the vector of summary statistics -- the number of domain elements seen once, twice, etc. in the sample -- and output the dot product between these summary statistics, and a fixed vector of coefficients. We term such estimators \emph{linear}. This historical proclivity towards linear estimators is slightly perplexing, since, despite many efforts over nearly 60 years, all proposed such estimators have significantly sub optimal convergence, compared to the bounds shown in [VV11]. Our main result, in some sense vindicating this insistence on linear estimators, is that for any property in this broad class, there exists a near-optimal linear estimator. Additionally, we give a practical and polynomial-time algorithm for constructing such estimators for any given parameters. While this result does not yield explicit bounds on the sample complexities of these estimation tasks, we leverage the insights provided by this result to give explicit constructions of near-optimal linear estimators for three properties: entropy, $L_1$ distance to uniformity, and for pairs of distributions, $L_1$ distance. Our entropy estimator, when given $O(\frac{n}{\eps \log n})$ independent samples from a distribution of support at most $n,$ will estimate the entropy of the distribution to within additive accuracy $\epsilon$, with probability of failure $o(1/poly(n)).$ From the recent lower bounds given in [VV11], this estimator is optimal, to constant factor, both in its dependence on $n$, and its dependence on $\epsilon.$ In particular, the inverse-linear convergence rate of this estimator resolves the main open question of [VV11], which left open the possibility that the error decreased only with the square root of the number of samples. Our distance to uniformity estimator, when given $O(\frac{m}{\eps^2\log m})$ independent samples from any distribution, returns an $\eps$-accurate estimate of the $L_1$ distance to the uniform distribution of support $m$. This is constant-factor optimal, for constant $\epsilon$. Finally, our framework extends naturally to properties of pairs of distributions, including estimating the $L_1$ distance and KL-divergence between pairs of distributions. We give an explicit linear estimator for estimating $L_1$ distance to additive accuracy $\epsilon$ using $O(\frac{n}{\eps^2\log n})$ samples from each distribution, which is constant-factor optimal, for constant $\epsilon$. This is the first sub linear-sample estimator for this fundamental property."
473722,15514,23684,Stochastic coalescence in logarithmic time,2012,"The following distributed coalescence protocol was introduced by Dahlia Malkhi in 2006 motivated by applications in social networking. Initially there are n agents wishing to coalesce into one cluster via a decentralized stochastic process, where each round is as follows: Every cluster flips a fair coin to dictate whether it is to issue or accept requests in this round. Issuing a request amounts to contacting a cluster randomly chosen proportionally to its size. A cluster accepting requests is to select an incoming one uniformly (if there are such) and merge with that cluster. Empirical results by Fernandess and Malkhi suggested the protocol concludes in O(log n) rounds with high probability, whereas numerical estimates by Oded Schramm, based on an ingenious analytic approximation, suggested that the coalescence time should be super-logarithmic.#R##N##R##N#Our contribution is a rigorous study of the stochastic coalescence process with two consequences. First, we confirm that the above process indeed requires super-logarithmic time w.h.p., where the inefficient rounds are due to oversized clusters that occasionally develop. Second, we remedy this by showing that a simple modification produces an essentially optimal distributed protocol: If clusters favor their smallest incoming merge request then the process does terminate in O(log n) rounds w.h.p., and simulations show that the new protocol readily outperforms the original one. Our upper bound hinges on a potential function involving the logarithm of the number of clusters and the cluster-susceptibility, carefully chosen to form a supermartingale. The analysis of the lower bound builds upon the novel approach of Schramm which may find additional applications: Rather than seeking a single parameter that controls the system behavior, instead one approximates the system by the Laplace transform of the entire cluster-size distribution."
2260010,15514,9099,Random partial paired comparison for subjective video quality assessment via hodgerank,2011,"Subjective visual quality evaluation provides the groundtruth and source of inspiration in building objective visual quality metrics. Paired comparison is expected to yield more reliable results; however, this is an expensive and timeconsuming process. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of HodgeRank on Random Graphs (HRRG) to achieve efficient and reliable subjective Video Quality Assessment (VQA). To address the challenge of a potentially large number of combinations of videos to be assessed, the proposed methodology does not require the participants to perform the complete comparison of all the paired videos. Instead, participants only need to perform a random sample of all possible paired comparisons, which saves a great amount of time and labor. In contrast to the traditional deterministic incomplete block designs, our random design is not only suitable for traditional laboratory and focus-group studies, but also fit for crowdsourcing experiments on Internet where the raters are distributive over Internet and it is hard to control with precise experimental designs.   Our contribution in this work is three-fold: 1) a HRRG framework is proposed to quantify the quality of video; 2) a new random design principle is investigated to conduct paired comparison based on Erdos-Renyi random graph theory; 3) Hodge decomposition is introduced to derive, from incomplete and imbalanced data, quality scores of videos and inconsistency of participants'judgments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on LIVE Database. Equipped with random graph theory and HodgeRank, our scheme has the following advantages over the traditional ones: 1) data collection is simple and easy to handle, and thus is more suitable for crowdsourcing on Internet; 2) workload on participants is lower and more flexible; 3) the rating procedure is efficient, labor-saving, and more importantly, without jeopardizing the accuracy of the results."
1122256,15514,23735,Fast Planning of Well Conditioned Trajectories for Model Learning,2014,"This paper discusses the problem of planning well conditioned trajectories for learning a class of nonlinear models such as the imaging model of a camera and the multibody dynamic model of a robot. In such model learning problems, the model parameters can be linearly decoupled from system variables in the feature space. The learning accuracy and robustness against measurement noise and unmodeled response depend largely on the condition number of the data matrix. A new method is proposed to plan well conditioned trajectories efficiently by using low-discrepancy sequences and matrix subset selection. Application examples show promising results. I. INTRODUCTION Proper modeling is important to the control of mechatronic systems. Torque feedforward control based on an accurate dynamic model largely reduces the trajectory tracking error of servo systems. In iterative learning control and disturbance observer control, the bandwidth of effective disturbance rejection is largely determined by the accuracy of the model. In visual servoing, an inaccurate camera model might lead to undesired response and even instability. In system diagnose, model learning with high accuracy is needed for telling the health of the system. A model with high fidelity is also indispensable to virtual development based on computer simulations. In general, system behavior can be modeled as y = g(x,Z), where x ∈ R s includes the minimum number of system variables that can fully describe the system status (e.g., position, velocity, and acceleration of a point mass), y ∈ R o includes the system variables that are determined or required by x, and Z ∈ R p consists of p model parameters to be learned. Besides the linear models that can be transformed into transfer functions, many important models are nonlinear and cannot be identified using frequency response. Such models include, but not limited to the imaging model of a camera and the multibody dynamic model of a robot. There are often two major steps in learning those models. First, the model is transformed to the form of"

The problem is NP-hard, but Feldman and Ruhl (FOCS '99; SICOMP '06) gave a novel nO(k) algorithm for the SCSS problem, where n is the number of vertices in the graph and k is the number of terminals. We explore how much easier the problem becomes on planar directed graphs.#R##N##R##N#• Our main algorithmic result is a 2O(k log k) · nO(√k) algorithm for planar SCSS, which is an improvement of a factor of O(√k) in the exponent over the algorithm of Feldman and Ruhl.#R##N##R##N#• Our main hardness result is a matching lower bound for our algorithm: we show that planar SCSS does not have an f(k) · no(√k) algorithm for any computable function f, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails.#R##N##R##N#The algorithm eventually relies on the excluded grid theorem for planar graphs, but we stress that it is not simply a straightforward application of treewidth-based techniques: we need several layers of abstraction to arrive to a problem formulation where the speedup due to planarity can be exploited.

1354271,15514,23735,Demonstration-based control of supernumerary robotic limbs,2012,"The body representation in the human mind is dynamic, and illusions or traumatic events can modify it to include additional limbs. This remarkable adaptability of the central nervous system to different body configurations opens new possibilities in the field of human augmentation. In order to fully exploit this potential, we developed a new type of wearable co-robot that can perform tasks in close coordination with the human user. The system, named Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), consists of two additional robotic arms worn through a backpack-like harness. The SRL can assist the user by holding objects, lifting weights and streamlining the execution of a task. If the SRL perform movements closely coordinated with the user and exhibit human-like dynamics, they might be incorporated into the body representation and perceived as parts of the user's body. As a result, the human would be able to extend the range of available skills and manipulation possibilities, performing tasks more effectively and with less effort. This paper presents a communication, estimation and control method for the SRL, aimed to perform tasks in tight coordination with the wearer. The SRL observes the user motion, and actively assists the human by employing a coordinated control algorithm. In particular, skills involving the direct cooperation of two human workers are transferred to the SRL and a single user. Demonstration data of the two humans - a leader and an assistant - are analyzed and a state estimation algorithm is extracted from them. This can be used to control the SRL accordingly with the used end effectors. A causal relationship relating the assistant's motion to the leader's motion is identified based on System Identification methods. This approach is applied to a drilling operation performed by two workers. An effective coordination skill is identified and transferred to the SRL, to make them act like the human follower."
2287199,15514,23735,A virtual scalpel system for computer-assisted laser microsurgery,2011,"A medical robotic system for teleoperated laser microsurgery based on a concept we have called “virtual scalpel” is presented in this paper. This system allows surgeries to be safely and precisely performed using a graphics pen directly over a live video from the surgical site. This is shown to eliminate hand-eye coordination problems that affect other microsurgery systems and to make full use of the operator's manual dexterity without requiring extra training. The implementation of this system, which is based on a tablet PC and a new motorized laser micromanipulator offering 1µm aiming accuracy within the traditional line-of-sight 2D operative space, is fully described. This includes details on the system's hardware and software structures and on its calibration process, which is essential for guaranteeing precise matching between a point touched on the live video and the laser aiming point at the surgical site. Together, the new hardware and software structures make both the calibration parameters and the laser aiming accuracy (on any plane orthogonal to the imaging axis) independent of the target distance and of its motions. Automatic laser control based on new intraoperative planning software and safety improvements based on virtual features are also described in this paper, which concludes by presenting results from sets of path following evaluation experiments conducted with 10 different subjects. These demonstrate an error reduction of almost 50% when using the virtual scalpel system versus the traditional laser microsurgery setup, and an 80% error reduction when using the automatic laser control routines, evidencing great improvements in terms of precision and controllability, and suggesting that the technological advances presented herein will lead to a significantly enhanced capacity for treating a variety of internal human pathologies."
656480,15514,23634,SelfishMigrate: A Scalable Algorithm for Non-clairvoyantly Scheduling Heterogeneous Processors,2014,"We consider the classical problem of minimizing the total weighted flow-time for unrelated machines in the online non-clairvoyant setting. In this problem, a set of jobs J arrive over time to be scheduled on a set of M machines. Each job J has processing length pj, weight wj, and is processed at a rate of lij when scheduled on machine i. The online scheduler knows the values of wj and lij upon arrival of the job, but is not aware of the quantity pj. We present the first online algorithm that is scalable ((1+e)-speed O(1/2)-competitive for any constant e > 0) for the total weighted flow-time objective. No non-trivial results were known for this setting, except for the most basic case of identical machines. Our result resolves a major open problem in online scheduling theory. Moreover, we also show that no job needs more than a logarithmic number of migrations. We further extend our result and give a scalable algorithm for the objective of minimizing total weighted flow-time plus energy cost for the case of unrelated machines. In this problem, each machine can be sped up by a factor of f-1i(P) when consuming power P, where fi is an arbitrary strictly convex power function. In particular, we get an O(γ2)-competitive algorithm when all power functions are of form sγ. These are the first non-trivial non-clairvoyant results in any setting with heterogeneous machines. The key algorithmic idea is to let jobs migrate selfishly until they converge to an equilibrium. Towards this end, we define a game where each job's utility which is closely tied to the instantaneous increase in the objective the job is responsible for, and each machine declares a policy that assigns priorities to jobs based on when they migrate to it, and the execution speeds. This has a spirit similar to coordination mechanisms that attempt to achieve near optimum welfare in the presence of selfish agents (jobs). To the best our knowledge, this is the first work that demonstrates the usefulness of ideas from coordination mechanisms and Nash equilibria for designing and analyzing online algorithms."
669214,15514,23735,A voice-coil actuated ultrasound micro-scanner for intraoral high resolution impression taking,2012,"Silicone based impression-taking of prepared teeth followed by plaster casting is well-established but potentially less reliable, error-prone and inefficient for newly emerging techniques such as computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) of dental prosthetics. Intra-oral optical scanners have been introduced to increase efficiency of CAM but no breakthrough occurred so far. Oral liquids such as saliva, blood and sulcular fluid are still one of the main problems since the preparation area must be completely dry. Moreover, sub-gingival preparations need to be uncovered invasively prior to scanning and a reflecting powder coating is required in some cases. High frequency ultrasound (HFUS) has been recently introduced as an alternative to optical scanning. Ultrasound is less sensitive against oral fluids and in principal able to penetrate gingiva in a patient-friendly and cost-effective way. Although HFUS systems have been introduced for ophthalmology, dermatology or small animal imaging, none of them suits the challenging requirements and high accuracy demands for intra-oral micro-scanning of prepared teeth. For this reason, we conceived a new ultrasonic micro-scanning device based on a voice-coil actuated spherically focused HFUS transducer for intra-oral use. The system, which is designed for both highly dynamic accurate positioning and micrometer-resolution, is supplied with a sensor providing position feedback for motion control as well as the ultrasound trigger engine. In this contribution, we describe the set-up and evaluate the lateral displacement of the micro-scanners end-effector with respect to the oscillation rate using laser triangulation. The results are in good agreement to the requirements of an intra-oral ultrasound based micro-scanner."

Formal methods and formal verification is necessary to prove the correctness and improve performance of software systems in various levels of design and implementation, too. Security Discussion is an important issue in computer systems. Since the antivirus applications have very important role in computer systems security, verifying these applications is very essential and necessary. In this paper, we present four new approaches for antivirus system behavior and a behavioral model of protection services in the antivirus system is proposed. We divided the behavioral model in to preventive behavior and control behavior and then we formal these behaviors. Finally by using some definitions we explain the way these behaviors are mapped on each other by using our new approaches. K EYWORDS Antivirus system, protection services, behavioral modeling, formal method; 1. I NTRODUCTION Today, antivirus software is very important in business and software development, because any computer the system should install a security application on itself to maintain regularize and security of its data [1]. In the recent years, many attacks are occurred to home the systems, bank servers and military systems by Viruses and Malwares [2]. Information maintenance and prevent to data accessibility is the cause of attacking and destroying data which has been occurred by invasive malware widely and suddenly [3]. So, users need to powerful security applications which secure their systems against the attack of viruses and malwares [4]. The attacks in the system security section is divided into two parts [5]. The first set of attacks are enabled to eliminate security files or security applications of a computer the system. After disabling these files and applications, these attacks access to important data in the computer system. The second set of attacks can remove a set of special files and destroying important files. These attacks are executed and handled from intelligence agencies and hacker on computer systems of the users. These attacks have not needed to destroy the system security of computer. But, these attacks are executed and run by hiding themselves in URL web addresses or in created files using routing software such as Microsoft office, adobe reader, win zip, etc. By notice to these attacks, a computer system need to an online security system.

1648764,15514,65,Behavioral Turing test using two-axis actuators,2012,"The Turing test is an imitation game for determining the intelligence of an agent. In spite of its simplified setting, the use of natural language between two agents in the test is still too high a hurdle for achieving fruitful results in the field of artificial intelligence. In this paper, the authors propose a variation of the Turing test with a restricted communication method. This modified test uses behaviors generated by two-axis actuators for communication instead of the natural language dialogue used in the normal Turing test. This reduction of scope reveals what kinds of features are essential for an imitation game, and broaden the application brought by Turing test. When we learn what sorts of communication become possible with restricted actuation, we can apply this knowledge to any kind of robot or device in the real world. First, we tried to determine what elements are critical for communication between a user and a robot through a preliminary experiment involving human-human communication. A human manipulator received a video image as input and controlled a robot box with two actuators in a way that would lead a user to put other objects into the box. The results indicated what kinds of behavior are required to show the intention of the manipulator to the user. Second, we analyzed the result of the preliminary experiment, organized a behavioral model from the result, and programmed the robot box to run the model. The behavior of the robot was programmed according to the user's head and hand locations as identified by a motion captures system. The robot automatically interact with a human without human manipulation with this program. Third, we conducted a behavioral Turing test in a communication task whereby the human collected items according to the instructions of the robot box. In this test, two actuators on the box is controlled both by human manipulator and our program. The answers of users suggests that the users could not identify which is controlled by a human manipulator or the program. This result indicates that the Turing test succeed in a restricted behavioral level."
1404052,15514,23634,Achieving Target Equilibria in Network Routing Games without Knowing the Latency Functions,2014,"The analysis of network routing games typically assumes, right at the onset, precise and detailed information about the latency functions. Such information may, however, be unavailable or difficult to obtain. Moreover, one is often primarily interested in enforcing a desirable target flow as the equilibrium by suitably influencing player behavior in the routing game. We ask whether one can achieve target flows as equilibria without knowing the underlying latency functions. Our main result gives a crisp positive answer to this question. We show that, under fairly general settings, one can efficiently compute edge tolls that induce a given target multicommodity flow in a nonatomic routing game using a polynomial number of queries to an oracle that takes candidate tolls as input and returns the resulting equilibrium flow. This result is obtained via a novel application of the ellipsoid method, and applies to arbitrary multicommodity settings and non-linear latency functions. Our algorithm extends easily to many other settings, such as (i) when certain edges cannot be tolled or there is an upper bound on the total toll paid by a user, and (ii) general nonatomic congestion games. We obtain tighter bounds on the query complexity for series-parallel networks, and single-commodity routing games with linear latency functions, and complement these with a query-complexity lower bound applicable even to single-commodity routing games on parallel-link graphs with linear latency functions. We also explore the use of Stackelberg routing to achieve target equilibria and obtain strong positive results for series-parallel graphs. Our results build upon various new techniques that we develop pertaining to the computation of, and connections between, different notions of approximate equilibrium, properties of multicommodity flows and tolls in series-parallel graphs, and sensitivity of equilibrium flow with respect to tolls. Our results demonstrate that one can indeed circumvent the potentially-onerous task of modeling latency functions, and yet obtain meaningful results for the underlying routing game."
1018684,15514,23735,Rolling a dynamic object with a planar soft-fingertip robot arm,2013,"Force-position control through one or multiple robots, or fingers, typically assumes a rigid endpoint without rolling nor slipping. However, there are some interesting tasks where rolling is involved, such as turning a knob (object is pivoting at a fixed rotational axis) or rolling a wheel (object rotational axis is moving). In such a case, rigid endpoint force control becomes very difficult if not impossible, even for us humans. This stems from two facts, firstly, infinitesimally small rigid point does not yield a tangent force, therefore it is very difficult to control it indirectly; and secondly, the pair robot-object stands for a highly non-linear constrained underactuated dynamical systems. In this paper, we aim at exploring rolling of a rigid dynamic circular object with hemispherical deformable fingertip, then with area, not point, contact. The dynamic model and a control scheme are presented inspired in previous works, but regulation of normal and tangential forces, as well as position and orientation of the object are synthesized. In particular, tangential force control proves instrumental to regulate posture, and displacement of the object with a simple transpose Jacobian Cartesian PDF+g control. Regulation of rolling angle and displacement with stable normal and tangential forces are obtained without force sensing, neither any model of the deformation nor any dynamic parameter of the object. To entertain these control objectives, a redundant configuration is required so as to yield local regulation, based on the stability-in-the-manifold criteria, whose dimension is greater than the operational space. Illustrative simulations are discussed that provide insight into the closed-loop numerical performance, and finally, remarks on the structure and potential applications are addressed."
1334296,15514,9099,A mobile interactive robot for gathering structured social video,2011,"Documentaries are typically captured in a very structured way, using teams to film and interview people. We developed an autonomous method for capturing structured cinema verite style documentaries through an interactive robotic camera, which was used as a mobile physical agent to facilitate interaction and story gathering within a ubiquitous media framework. We sent this robot out to autonomously gather human narrative about its environment. The robot had a specific story capture goal and leveraged humans to attain that goal. The robot collected a 1st person view of stories unfolding in real life, and as it engaged with its subjects via a preset dialog, these media clips were intrinsically structured. We evaluated this agent by way of determining complete vs. incomplete interactions. Complete interactions were those that generated viable and interesting videos, which could be edited together into a larger narrative. It was found that 30% of the interactions captured were complete interactions. Our results suggested that changes in the system would only produce incrementally more complete interactions, as external factors like natural bias or busyness of the user come into play. The types of users who encountered the robot were fairly polar; either they wanted to interact or did not - very few partial interactions went on for more than 1 minute. Users who partially interacted with the robot were found to treat it rougher than those who completed the full interaction. It was also determined that this type of limited-interaction system is best suited for short-term encounters. At the end of the study, a short cinema verite documentary showcasing the people and activity in our building was easily produced from the structured videos that were captured, indicating the utility of this approach."
1431139,15514,23634,Online Bipartite Matching in Offline Time,2014,"This paper investigates the problem of maintaining maximum size matchings in incremental bipartite graphs. In this problem a bipartite graph G between n clients and n servers is revealed online. The clients arrive in an arbitrary order and request to be matched to a subset of servers. In our model we allow the clients to switch between servers and want to maximize the matching size between them, i.e., after a client arrives we find an augmenting path from a client to a free server. Our goals in this model are twofold. First, we want to minimize the number of times clients are reallocated between the servers. Second, we want to give fast algorithms that recompute such reallocation. As for the number of changes, we propose a greedy algorithm that chooses an augmenting path π that minimizes the maximum number of times each server in π was used by augmenting paths so far. We show that in this algorithm each server has its client reassigned O(√n) times. This gives an O(n3/2) bound on the total number of changes, what gives a progres towards the main open question risen by Chaudhuri et al. (INFOCOM'09) who asked to prove O(nlog n) upper bound. Next, we argue that the same bound holds in the decremental case. Moreover, we show incremental and decremental algorithms that maintain (1 -- e)-approximate matching with total of O(e -- 1n) reallocations, for any e>0. Finally, we address the question of how to efficiently compute paths given by this greedy algorithm. We show that by introducing proper amortization we can obtain an incremental algorithm that maintains the maximum size matching in total O(√nm) time. This matches the running time of one of the fastest static maximum matching algorithms that was given by Hopcroft and Karp (SIAM J. Comput '73). We extend our result to decremental case where we give the same total bound on the running time. Additionally, we show O(e -- 1m) time incremental and decremental algorithms that maintain (1 -- e)-approximate matching for any e > 0. Observe that this bound matches the running time of the fastest approximate static solution as well."
1168545,15514,23735,A case study of trajectory transfer through non-rigid registration for a simplified suturing scenario,2013,"Suturing is an important yet time-consuming part of surgery. A fast and robust autonomous procedure could reduce surgeon fatigue, and shorten operation times. It could also be of particular importance for suturing in remote tele-surgery settings where latency can complicate the master-slave mode control that is the current practice for robotic surgery with systems like the da Vinci®. We study the applicability of the trajectory transfer algorithm proposed in [12] to the automation of suturing. The core idea of this procedure is to first use non-rigid registration to find a 3D warping function which maps the demonstration scene onto the test scene, then use this warping function to transform the robot end-effector trajectory. Finally a robot joint trajectory is generated by solving a trajectory optimization problem that attempts to find the closest feasible trajectory, accounting for external constraints, such as joint limits and obstacles. Our experiments investigate generalization from a single demonstration to differing initial conditions. A first set of experiments considers the problem of having a simulated Raven II system [5] suture two flaps of tissue together. A second set of experiments considers a PR2 robot performing sutures in a scaled-up experimental setup. The simulation experiments were fully autonomous. For the real-world experiments we provided human input to assist with the detection of landmarks to be fed into the registration algorithm. The success rate for learning from a single demonstration is high for moderate perturbations from the demonstration's initial conditions, and it gradually decreases for larger perturbations."
2131862,15514,23735,A robust and modular multi-sensor fusion approach applied to MAV navigation,2013,"It has been long known that fusing information from multiple sensors for robot navigation results in increased robustness and accuracy. However, accurate calibration of the sensor ensemble prior to deployment in the field as well as coping with sensor outages, different measurement rates and delays, render multi-sensor fusion a challenge. As a result, most often, systems do not exploit all the sensor information available in exchange for simplicity. For example, on a mission requiring transition of the robot from indoors to outdoors, it is the norm to ignore the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals which become freely available once outdoors and instead, rely only on sensor feeds (e.g., vision and laser) continuously available throughout the mission. Naturally, this comes at the expense of robustness and accuracy in real deployment. This paper presents a generic framework, dubbed MultiSensor-Fusion Extended Kalman Filter (MSF-EKF), able to process delayed, relative and absolute measurements from a theoretically unlimited number of different sensors and sensor types, while allowing self-calibration of the sensor-suite online. The modularity of MSF-EKF allows seamless handling of additional/lost sensor signals during operation while employing a state buffering scheme augmented with Iterated EKF (IEKF) updates to allow for efficient re-linearization of the prediction to get near optimal linearization points for both absolute and relative state updates. We demonstrate our approach in outdoor navigation experiments using a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) equipped with a GPS receiver as well as visual, inertial, and pressure sensors."
329992,15514,23684,Local-search based approximation algorithms for mobile facility location problems,2013,"We consider the mobile facility location (MFL) problem. We are given a set of facilities and clients located in a common metric space G = (V, c). The goal is to move each facility from its initial location to a destination (in V) and assign each client to the destination of some facility so as to minimize the sum of the movement-costs of the facilities and the client-assignment costs. This abstracts facility-location settings where one has the flexibility of moving facilities from their current locations to other destinations so as to serve clients more efficiently by reducing their assignment costs.#R##N##R##N#We give the first local-search based approximation algorithm for this problem and achieve the best-known approximation guarantee. Our main result is (3 + e)-approximation for this problem for any constant e > 0 using local search. The previous best guarantee for MFL was an 8-approximation algorithm due to Friggstad and Salavatipour [12] based on LP-rounding. Our guarantee matches the best-known approximation guarantee for the k-median problem. Since there is an approximation-preserving reduction from the k-median problem to MFL, any improvement of our result would imply an analogous improvement for the k-median problem. Furthermore, our analysis is tight (up to o(1) factors) since the tight example for the local-search based 3-approximation algorithm for k-median can be easily adapted to show that our local-search algorithm has a tight approximation ratio of 3. Our results extend to the weighted generalization wherein each facility i has a non-negative weight wi and the movement cost for i is wi times the distance traveled by i.#R##N##R##N#In contrast to the k-median problem, the local search procedure that moves, at each step, a constant number of facilities (to chosen destinations) and assigns each client to the nearest destination, is known to have an unbounded locality gap. Our local-search algorithm is a natural and simple variant, where we only select the destinations of the facilities in each step and optimally rematch the facilities to these destinations (which might entail moving all facilities). One of the chief novelties in the analysis is that in order to generate a suitable collection of local-search moves whose resulting inequalities yield the desired bound on the cost of a local-optimum, we define a tree-like structure that (loosely speaking) functions as a recursion tree, using which we spawn off local-search moves by exploring this tree to a constant depth."
2040189,15514,23735,A collaborative control system for telepresence robots,2012,"Interest in telepresence robots is at an all time high, and several companies are already commercializing early or basic versions. There seems to be a huge potential for their use in professional applications, where they can help address some of the challenges companies have found in integrating a geographically distributed work force. However, teleoperation of these robots is typically a difficult task. This difficulty can be attributed to limitations on the information provided to the operator and to communication delay and failures. This may compromise the safety of the people and of the robot during its navigation through the environment. Most commercial systems currently control this risk by reducing size and weight of their robots. Research effort in addressing this problem is generally based on “assisted driving”, which typically adds a “collision avoidance” layer, limiting or avoiding movements that would lead to a collision. In this article, we bring assisted driving to a new level, by introducing concepts from collaborative driving to telepresence robots. More specifically, we use the input from the operator as a general guidance to the target direction, then couple that with a variable degree of autonomy to the robot, depending on the task and the environment. Previous work has shown collision avoidance makes operation easier and reduce the number of collisions. In addition (and in contrast to traditional collision avoidance systems), our approach also reduces the time required to complete a circuit, making navigation easier, safer, and faster. The methodology was evaluated through a controlled user study (N=18). Results show that the use of the proposed collaborative control helped reduce the number of collisions (none in most cases) and also decreased the time to complete the designated task."
1306683,15514,23634,Almost Optimal Canonical Property Testers for Satisfiability,2012,"In the $(k, d)$-Function-SAT problem we are given a set of $n$ variables $\{X_1, \dots, X_n\}$ that can take values from the set $\{1, \dots, d\}$ and a set of Boolean constraints on these variables, where each constraint is of the form $f:\{1, \dots, d\}^k \right arrow \{0, 1\}$, i.e. the constraint depends on exactly $k$ of these variables. We will treat $k$ and $d$ as constants. The goal is to determine whether the set of constraints has a satisfying assignment, i.e. an assignment to the variables such that all constraints simultanuously map to $1$. In this paper, we study $(k, d)$-Function-SAT in the property testing model for dense instances. We call an instance $\epsilon$-far from satisfiable, if every assignment violates more than $\epsilon n^k$ constraints. A property testing algorithm is a randomized algorithm that, given oracle access to the set of constraints, must accept with probability at least $3/4$ all satisfiable inputs and rejects with probability at least $3/4$ all inputs, which are $\epsilon$-far from satisfiable. We analyze the canonical non-adaptive property testing algorithm with one-sided error: Sample $r$ variables and accept, if and only if the induced set of constraints has a satisfying assignment. The value of $r$ will be called the \emph{sample complexity} of the algorithm. We show that there is an $r_0 = \wide tilde O(1/\epsilon)$ such that for any instance that is $\epsilon$-far from satisfiable, the probability, that a random sample on $r\ge r_0$ variables is satisfiable, is at most $1/4$. This implies that the above algorithm is a property tester. The obtained sample complexity is nearly optimal for canonical testers as a lower bound of $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ on the sample complexity is known. Previously, a tester with sample complexity $o(1/\epsilon^2)$ was only known for the very special case of testing bipartite ness in the dense graph model \cite{AK02}. Our new general result improves the best previous result for testing satisfiability (and even for the special case of $3$-colorability in graphs) from sample complexity $\wide tilde O(1/\epsilon^2)$ to $\wide tilde O(1/\epsilon)$. It also slightly improves the sample complexity for the special case of bipartite ness. Improving the sample complexity for $(k, d)$-Function-SAT (or special cases of it) had been posed in several papers as an open problem \cite{AK02, AS03, RS11}. This paper solves this problem nearly optimally for canonical testers and, in the case of $k=2$, also for non-adaptive testers as there is a lower bound of $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ on the query complexity of non-adaptive testers for bipartite ness in the dense graph model \cite{BT04}, where the query complexity denotes the number of queries asked about the graph (for a canonical tester in graphs, the query complexity is the square of its sample complexity). As a byproduct, we obtain an algorithm, which, given a satisfiable set of constraints, computes in time $O(n/\epsilon^{O(1)} + 2^{\wide tilde O(1/\epsilon)})$ a solution, which violates at most $\epsilon n^k$ constraints."
2038,15514,23684,How to sell hyperedges: the hypermatching assignment problem,2013,"We are given a set of clients with budget constraints and a set of indivisible items. Each client is willing to buy one or more bundles of (at most) k items each (bundles can be seen as hyperedges in a k-hypergraph). If client i gets a bundle e, she pays bi,e and yields a net profit wi,e. The Hypermatching Assignment Problem (HAP) is to assign a set of pairwise disjoint bundles to clients so as to maximize the total profit while respecting the budgets. This problem has various applications in production planning and budget-constrained auctions and generalizes well-studied problems in combinatorial optimization: for example the weighted (unweighted) k-hypergraph matching problem is the special case of HAP with one client having unbounded budget and general (unit) profits; the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) is the special case of HAP with k = 1.#R##N##R##N#Let e > 0 denote an arbitrarily small constant. In this paper we obtain the following main results:#R##N##R##N#• We give a randomized (k + 1 + e) approximation algorithm for HAP, which is based on rounding the 1-round Lasserre strengthening of a novel LP. This is one of a few approximation results based on Lasserre hierarchies and our approach might be of independent interest. We remark that for weighted k-hypergraph matching no LP nor SDP relaxation is known to have integrality gap better than k − 1 + 1/k for general k [Chan and Lau, SODA'10].#R##N##R##N#• For the relevant special case that one wants to maximize the total revenue (i.e., bi,e = wi,e), we present a local search based (k + O (√k))/2 approximation algorithm for k = O(1). This almost matches the best known (k + 1 + e)/2 approximation ratio by Berman [SWAT'00] for the (less general) weighted k-hypergraph matching problem.#R##N##R##N#• For the unweighted k-hypergraph matching problem, we present a (k + 1 + e)/3 approximation in quasipolynomial time. This improves over the (k + 2)/3 approximation by Halldorsson [SODA'95] (also in quasipolynomial time). In particular this suggests that a 4/3 + e approximation for 3-dimensional matching might exist, whereas the currently best known polynomial-time approximation ratio is 3/2."
1054464,15514,23735,A miniature bio-inspired position sensing device for the control of micro-aerial robots,2012,"Here we present an example of a novel bio-inspired active vision system with a vibrating eye that can rotate freely by means of a miniature rotary piezo motor. Active micro-vibrations were applied to the eye by using an innovative micro-mechanism based on a tiny stepper motor. The hyperacuity of this inexpensive position-sensing device, which results from the active micro-vibrations, makes it capable of measuring the angular position of a contrasting edge. Among the many miniature rotary actuators available, piezomotors are often used when small size, low mass, great accuracy and high dynamics are required. The newly off-the-shelf miniature ultrasonic piezomotor presented in this study along with its position servo control system is supplied ready-integrated into a printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB Piezomotor (or PCBMotor) has many advantages, such as high torque (it requires no reducer), fast dynamics (the mechanical time constant is 3ms), a low mass (1gram) and a compact size (it is only 20mm in diameter and 2.6mm thick). The results of the tests conducted show that the performances of the PCBmotor connected to a custom-made miniature electronic driver make it a good alternative to the actuators classically used in robotic applications. In addition we present a simple visual processing, implemented onto a tiny microcontroller, composed of simple linear filtering and arithmetic operations. We show that our visual scanning sensor is a genuine position sensing device able to measure the relative angular position of a visual object with only two pixels and very few computational resources."
596445,15514,23684,Bidimensionality and EPTAS,2011,"Bidimensionality theory appears to be a powerful framework for the development of meta-algorithmic techniques. It was introduced by Demaine et al. [ J. ACM 2005 ] as a tool to obtain sub-exponential time parameterized algorithms for problems on  H -minor free graphs. Demaine and Hajiaghayi [ SODA 2005 ] extended the theory to obtain polynomial time approximation schemes (PTASs) for bidimensional problems, and subsequently improved these results to EPTASs. Fomin et. al [ SODA 2010 ] established a third meta-algorithmic direction for bidimensionality theory by relating it to the existence of linear kernels for parameterized problems. In this paper we revisit bidimensionality theory from the perspective of approximation algorithms and redesign the framework for obtaining EPTASs to be more powerful, easier to apply and easier to understand.   One of the important conditions required in the framework developed by Demaine and Hajiaghayi [ SODA 2005 ] is that to obtain an EPTAS for a graph optimization problem Π, we have to know a constant-factor approximation algorithm for Π. Our approach eliminates this strong requirement, which makes it amenable to more problems. At the heart of our framework is a decomposition lemma which states that for most bidimensional problems, there is a polynomial time algorithm which given an  H -minor-free graph  G  as input and an ∈ > 0 outputs a vertex set  X  of size ∈ ·  OPT  such that the treewidth of  G \ X  is  O (1/∈). Here,  OPT  is the objective function value of the problem in question This allows us to obtain EPTASs on (apex)-minor-free graphs for all problems covered by the previous framework, as well as for a wide range of packing problems, partial covering problems and problems that are neither closed under taking minors, nor contractions. To the best of our knowledge for many of these problems including Cycle Packing, Vertex- H -Packing, Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree, and Partial  r -Dominating Set no EPTASs on planar graphs were previously known."
2414072,15514,23634,Dynamic Approximate All-Pairs Shortest Paths: Breaking the O(mn) Barrier and Derandomization,2013,"We study dynamic (1 + ϵ)-approximation algorithms for the all-pairs shortest paths problem in unweighted undirected n-node m-edge graphs under edge deletions. The fastest algorithm for this problem is a randomized algorithm with a total update time of Ȏ(mn) and constant query time by Roditty and Zwick (FOCS 2004). The fastest deterministic algorithm is from a 1981 paper by Even and Shiloach (JACM 1981); it has a total update time of O(mn 2 ) and constant query time. We improve these results as follows: (1) We present an algorithm with a total update time of Ȏ(n 5/2 ) and constant query time that has an additive error of two in addition to the 1 + ϵ multiplicative error. This beats the previous Ȏ(mn) time when m = Ω(n 3/2 ). Note that the additive error is unavoidable since, even in the static case, an O(n 3-δ )-time (a so-called truly sub cubic) combinatorial algorithm with 1 + ϵ multiplicative error cannot have an additive error less than 2 - ϵ, unless we make a major breakthrough for Boolean matrix multiplication (Dor, Halperin and Zwick FOCS 1996) and many other long-standing problems (Vassilevska Williams and Williams FOCS 2010). The algorithm can also be turned into a (2 + ϵ)-approximation algorithm (without an additive error) with the same time guarantees, improving the recent (3 + ϵ)-approximation algorithm with Ȏ(n 5/2+O(1√(log n)) ) running time of Bernstein and Roditty (SODA 2011) in terms of both approximation and time guarantees. (2) We present a deterministic algorithm with a total update time of Ȏ(mn) and a query time of O(log log n). The algorithm has a multiplicative error of 1 + ϵ and gives the first improved deterministic algorithm since 1981. It also answers an open question raised by Bernstein in his STOC 2013 paper. In order to achieve our results, we introduce two new techniques: (1) A lazy Even-Shiloach tree algorithm which maintains a bounded-distance shortest-paths tree on a certain type of emulator called locally persevering emulator. (2) A derandomization technique based on moving Even-Shiloach trees as a way to derandomize the standard random set argument. These techniques might be of independent interest."
987529,15514,23634,Approximation Schemes for Maximum Weight Independent Set of Rectangles,2013,"In the Maximum Weight Independent Set of Rectangles (MWISR) problem we are given a set of n axis-parallel rectangles in the 2D-plane, and the goal is to select a maximum weight subset of pairwise non-overlapping rectangles. Due to many applications, e.g. in data mining, map labeling and admission control, the problem has received a lot of attention by various research communities. We present the first (1 + e)-approximation algorithm for the MWISR problem with quasipolynomial running time 2 poly(log n/e) . In contrast, the best known polynomial time approximation algorithms for the problem achieve superconstant approximation ratios of O(log log n) (unweighted case) and O(log n/log log n) (weighted case). Key to our results is a new geometric dynamic program which recursively subdivides the plane into polygons of bounded complexity. We provide the technical tools that are needed to analyze its performance. In particular, we present a method of partitioning the plane into small and simple areas such that the rectangles of an optimal solution are intersected in a very controlled manner. Together with a novel application of the weighted planar graph separator theorem due to Arora et al. [4] this allows us to upper bound our approximation ratio by 1 + e. Our dynamic program is very general and we believe that it will be useful for other settings. In particular, we show that, when parametrized properly, it provides a polynomial time (1 + e)-approximation for the special case of the MWISR problem when each rectangle is relatively large in at least one dimension. Key to this analysis is a method to tile the plane in order to approximately describe the topology of these rectangles in an optimal solution. This technique might be a useful insight to design better polynomial time approximation algorithms or even a PTAS for the MWISR problem. In particular, note that our results imply that the MWISR problem is not APX-hard, unless NP ⊆ DTIME(2 polylog (n) )."
2807374,15514,23684,"Simple, fast and deterministic gossip and rumor spreading",2013,"We study gossip algorithms for the rumor spreading problem which asks each node to deliver a rumor to all nodes in an unknown network. Gossip algorithms allow nodes only to call one neighbor per round and have recently attracted attention as message efficient, simple and robust solutions to the rumor spreading problem.#R##N##R##N#A long series of papers analyzed the performance of uniform random gossip in which nodes repeatedly call a random neighbor to exchange all rumors with. A main result of this investigation was that uniform gossip completes in O(log n/Φ) rounds where Φ is the conductance of the network. More recently non-uniform random gossip schemes were devised to allow efficient rumor spreading in networks with bottlenecks. In particular, [Censor-Hillel et al., STOC'12] gave an O(log3 n) algorithm to solve the 1-local broadcast problem in which each node wants to exchange rumors locally with its 1-neighborhood. By repeatedly applying this protocol one can solve the global rumor spreading quickly for all networks with small diameter, independently of the conductance.#R##N##R##N#All these algorithms are inherently randomized in their design and analysis. A parallel research direction has been to reduce and determine the amount of randomness needed for efficient rumor spreading. This has been done via lower bounds for restricted models and by designing gossip algorithms with a reduced need for randomness, e.g., by using pseudorandom generators with short random seeds. The general intuition and consensus of these results has been that randomization plays a important role in effectively spreading rumors and that at least a polylogarithmic number of random bit are crucially needed.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we improves over this state of the art in several ways by presenting a deterministic gossip algorithm that solves the the k-local broadcast problem in 2(k + log n) log n rounds. Besides being the first efficient deterministic solution to the rumor spreading problem this algorithm is interesting in many aspects: It is simpler, more natural, more robust and faster than its randomized pendant and guarantees success with certainty instead of with high probability. Its analysis is furthermore simple, self-contained and fundamentally different from prior works."
627072,15514,23684,Flow-based algorithms for local graph clustering,2014,"Given a subset A of vertices of an undirected graph G, the cut-improvement problem asks us to find a subset S that is similar to A but has smaller conductance. An elegant algorithm for this problem has been given by Andersen and Lang [5] and requires solving a small number of single-commodity maximum flow computations over the whole graph G. In this paper, we introduce LocalImprove, the first cut-improvement algorithm that is local, i.e., that runs in time dependent on the size of the input set A rather than on the size of the entire graph. Moreover, LocalImprove achieves this local behavior while closely matching the same theoretical guarantee as the global algorithm of Andersen and Lang.#R##N##R##N#The main application of LocalImprove is to the design of better local-graph-partitioning algorithms. All previously known local algorithms for graph partitioning are random-walk based and can only guarantee an output conductance of [EQUATION] when the target set has conductance φopt e [0, 1]. Very recently, Zhu, Lattanzi and Mirrokni [35] improved this to [EQUATION] where the internal connectivity parameter Conn e [0, 1] is defined as the reciprocal of the mixing time of the random walk over the graph induced by the target set. This regime is of high practical interest in learning applications as it corresponds to the case when the target set is a well-connected ground-truth cluster. In this work, we show how to use LocalImprove to obtain a constant approximation O(φopt) as long as Conn/φopt = Ω(1). This yields the first flow-based algorithm for local graph partitioning. Moreover, its performance strictly outperforms the ones based on random walks and surprisingly matches that of the best known global algorithm, which is SDP-based, in this parameter regime [25].#R##N##R##N#Finally, our results show that spectral methods are not the only viable approach to the construction of local graph partitioning algorithm and open door to the study of algorithms with even better approximation and locality guarantees."
1317080,15514,20358,Revenue monotone mechanisms for online advertising,2014,"Online advertising is an essential part of the Internet and the main source of revenue for many web-centric firms such as search engines, social networks, and online publishers. A key component of online advertising is the auction mechanism which selects and prices the set of winning ads. This work is inspired by one of the biggest practical drawbacks of the widely popular Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is the unique incentive-compatible mechanism that maximizes social welfare. It is known that VCG lacks a desired property of revenue monotonicity - a natural notion which states that the revenue of a mechanism shouldn't go down as the number of bidders increase or if the bidders increase their bids. Most firms which depend on online advertising revenue have a large sales team to attract more bidders on their inventory as the general belief is that more bidders will increase competition, and hence revenue. However, the lack of revenue monotonicity of VCG conflicts with this general belief and can be strategically confusing for the firm's business.   In this work, we seek incentive-compatible mechanisms that are revenue-monotone. This natural property comes at the expense of social welfare - one can show that it is not possible to get incentive-compatibility, revenue-monotonicity, and optimal social welfare simultaneously. In light of this, we introduce the notion of Price of Revenue Monotonicity (PoRM) to capture the loss in social welfare of a revenue-monotone mechanism.   We further study revenue-monotonicity for two important online advertising scenarios. First one is the text vs image ad auction where in an ad slot, one can either show a single image ad or a few text ads. Second one is the video-pod auction where we have a video advertising slot of k seconds which can be filled with multiple video ads. For the image-text auction, we give a mechanism that satisfy both RM and IC and achieve PoRM of ∑ i=1  k  1/i ≈ ln k. We also show that the PoRM of our mechanism is the best possible by proving a matching lower bound of ∑ i=1  k  1/i on the PoRM of any deterministic mechanism under some mild assumptions. For the video-pod auction, we give a mechanism that achieves a PoRM of (⌊ log k ⌋ + 1) ⋅ (2 + ln k)."
74278,15514,23922,Basis Learning as an Algorithmic Primitive,2014,"A number of important problems in theoretical computer science and machine learning can be interpreted as recovering a certain basis. These include symmetric matrix eigendecomposition, certain tensor decompositions, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), spectral clustering and Gaussian mixture learning. Each of these problems reduces to an instance of our general model, which we call a Basis Encoding Function (BEF). We show that learning a basis within this model can then be provably and efficiently achieved using a first order iteration algorithm (gradient iteration). Our algorithm goes beyond tensor methods while generalizing a number of existing algorithms---e.g., the power method for symmetric matrices, the tensor power iteration for orthogonal decomposable tensors, and cumulant-based FastICA---all within a broader function-based dynamical systems framework. Our framework also unifies the unusual phenomenon observed in these domains that they can be solved using efficient non-convex optimization. Specifically, we describe a class of BEFs such that their local maxima on the unit sphere are in one-to-one correspondence with the basis elements. This description relies on a certain hidden convexity property of these functions. #R##N#We provide a complete theoretical analysis of the gradient iteration even when the BEF is perturbed. We show convergence and complexity bounds polynomial in dimension and other relevant parameters, such as perturbation size. Our perturbation results can be considered as a non-linear version of the classical Davis-Kahan theorem for perturbations of eigenvectors of symmetric matrices. In addition we show that our algorithm exhibits fast (superlinear) convergence and relate the speed of convergence to the properties of the BEF. Moreover, the gradient iteration algorithm can be easily and efficiently implemented in practice."
2090339,15514,23634,Learning Topic Models -- Going beyond SVD,2012,"Topic Modeling is an approach used for automatic comprehension and classification of data in a variety of settings, and perhaps the canonical application is in uncovering thematic structure in a corpus of documents. A number of foundational works both in machine learning and in theory have suggested a probabilistic model for documents, whereby documents arise as a convex combination of (i.e. distribution on) a small number of topic vectors, each topic vector being a distribution on words (i.e. a vector of word-frequencies). Similar models have since been used in a variety of application areas, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA model of Blei et al. is especially popular. Theoretical studies of topic modeling focus on learning the model's parameters assuming the data is actually generated from it. Existing approaches for the most part rely on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and consequently have one of two limitations: these works need to either assume that each document contains only one topic, or else can only recover the {\em span} of the topic vectors instead of the topic vectors themselves. This paper formally justifies Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) as a main tool in this context, which is an analog of SVD where all vectors are nonnegative. Using this tool we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for learning topic models without the above two limitations. The algorithm uses a fairly mild assumption about the underlying topic matrix called separability, which is usually found to hold in real-life data. Perhaps the most attractive feature of our algorithm is that it generalizes to yet more realistic models that incorporate topic-topic correlations, such as the Correlated Topic Model (CTM) and the Pachinko Allocation Model (PAM). We hope that this paper will motivate further theoretical results that use NMF as a replacement for SVD -- just as NMF has come to replace SVD in many applications."
1847889,15514,23684,Polytope approximation and the Mahler volume,2012,"The problem of approximating convex bodies by polytopes is an important and well studied problem. Given a convex body K in Rd, the objective is to minimize the number of vertices (alternatively, the number of facets) of an approximating polytope for a given Hausdorff error e. Results to date have been of two types. The first type assumes that K is smooth, and bounds hold in the limit as e tends to zero. The second type requires no such assumptions. The latter type includes the well known results of Dudley (1974) and Bronshteyn and Ivanov (1976), which show that in spaces of fixed dimension, O((diam(K)/e)(d−1)/2) vertices (alt., facets) suffice. Our results are of this latter type.#R##N##R##N#In our first result, under the assumption that the width of the body in any direction is at least e, we strengthen the above bound to [EQUATION]. This is never worse than the previous bound (by more than logarithmic factors) and may be significantly better for skinny bodies. Our analysis exploits an interesting analogy with a classical concept from the theory of convexity, called the Mahler volume. This is a dimensionless quantity that involves the product of the volumes of a convex body and its polar dual.#R##N##R##N#In our second result, we apply the same machinery to improve upon the best known bounds for answering e-approximate polytope membership queries. Given a convex polytope P defined as the intersection of halfspaces, such a query determines whether a query point q lies inside or outside P, but may return either answer if q's distance from P's boundary is at most e. We show that, without increasing storage, it is possible to reduce the best known search times for e-approximate polytope membership significantly. This further implies improvements to the best known search times for approximate nearest neighbor searching in spaces of fixed dimension."
1732816,15514,23634,The Dyck Language Edit Distance Problem in Near-Linear Time,2014,"Given a string σ over alphabet Σ and a grammar G defined over the same alphabet, how many minimum number of repairs (insertions, deletions and substitutions) are required to map σ into a valid member of G? The seminal work of Aho and Peterson in 1972 initiated the study of this language edit distance problem providing a dynamic programming algorithm for context free languages that runs in O(|G|2n3) time, where n is the string length and |G| is the grammar size. While later improvements reduced the running time to O(|G|n3), the cubic time complexity on the input length held a major bottleneck for applying these algorithms to their multitude of applications. In this paper, we study the language edit distance problem for a fundamental context free language, DYCK(s) representing the language of well-balanced parentheses of s different types, that has been pivotal in the development of formal language theory. We provide the very first it near-linear time} algorithm to tightly approximate the DYCK(s) language edit distance problem for any arbitrary s. DYCK(s) language edit distance significantly generalizes the well-studied string edit distance problem, and appears in most applications of language edit distance ranging from data quality in databases, generating automated error-correcting parsers in compiler optimization to structure prediction problems in biological sequences. Its nondeterministic counterpart is known as the hardest context free language. Our main result is an algorithm for edit distance computation to DYCK(s) for any positive integer s that runs in O(n1+ e polylog(n)) time and achieves an approximation factor of O(1/eβ(n)log|OPT|), for any e > 0. Here OPT is the optimal edit distance to DYCK(s) and β(n) is the best approximation factor known for the simpler problem of string edit distance running in analogous time. If we allow O(n1+e+|OPT|2ne) time, then the approximation factor can be reduced to O(1/e log|OPT|). Since the best known near-linear time algorithm for the string edit distance problem has β(n) = polylog(n), under near-linear time computation model both DYCK(s) language and string edit distance problems have polylog(n) approximation factors. This comes as a surprise since the former is a significant generalization of the latter and their exact computations via dynamic programming show a stark difference in time complexity. Rather less surprisingly, we show that the framework for efficiently approximating edit distance to DYCK(s) can be utilized for many other languages. We illustrate this by considering various memory checking languages (studied extensively under distributed verification) such as stack, queue, PQ and DEQUE which comprise of valid transcripts of stacks, queues, priority queues and double-ended queues respectively. Therefore, any language that can be recognized by these data structures, can also be repaired efficiently by our algorithm."

By designing efficient communication protocols and proving their optimality, we establish a number of intriguing connections to fundamental measures in optimization, convex geometry, and information theory.#R##N##R##N#1. To generate a classical distribution P(x, y), we tightly characterize the minimum amount of quantum communication needed by the psd-rank of P (as a matrix), a measure recently proposed by Fiorini, Massar, Pokutta, Tiwary and de Wolf (Proceedings of the 44th A CM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pages 95-106, 2012) in studies of the minimum size of extended formulations of optimization problems such as TSP. This echos the previous characterization for the optimal classical communication cost by the nonnegative rank of P. The result is obtained via investigating the more general case of bipartite quantum state generation and designing an optimal protocol for it.#R##N##R##N#2. When an approximation of e is allowed to generate a distribution (X, Y) ~ P, we present a classical protocol of the communication cost O((C(X, Y) + 1)/e), where C(X, Y) is common information, a well-studied measure in information theory introduced by Wyner (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 21(2):163-179, 1975). This also links nonnegative rank and common information, two seemingly unrelated quantities in different fields.#R##N##R##N#3. For approximately generating a quantum pure state |ψ>, we completely characterize the minimum cost by a corresponding approximate rank, closing a possibly exponential gap left in Ambainis, Schulman, Ta-Shma, Vazirani and Wigderson (SIAM Journal on Computing, 32(6):1570-1585, 2003)."

Flows on skew-symmetric graphs have been used to generalize maximum flow and maximum matching problems on graphs, initially by Tutte [1967], and later by Goldberg and Karzanov [1994, 1995]. In this paper, we introduce a separation problem, d-Skew-Symmetric Multicut, where we are given a skew-symmetric graph D, a family of T of d-sized subsets of vertices and an integer k. The objective is to decide if there is a set X ⊆ A of k arcs such that every set J in the family has a vertex v such that v and σ(v) are in different strongly connected components of D' = (V, A \ (X ∪ σ(X)). In this paper, we give an algorithm for d-Skew-Symmetric Multicut which runs in time O((4d)k(m+n+e)), where m is the number of arcs in the graph, n the number of vertices and e the length of the family given in the input.#R##N##R##N#This problem, apart from being independently interesting, also abstracts out and captures the main combinatorial obstacles towards solving numerous classical problems. Our algorithm for d-Skew-Symmetric Multicut paves the way for the first linear time parameterized algorithms for several problems.

Then, using linear time parameter preserving reductions to Almost 2-SAT, we obtain algorithms for Odd Cycle Transversal and Edge Bipartization which run in time O(4kk4(m+n)) and O(4kk5(m+n)) respectively where k is size of the solution, m and n are the number of edges and vertices respectively. This resolves an open problem posed by Reed, Smith and Vetta [Operations Research Letters, 2003] and improves upon the earlier almost linear time algorithm of Kawarabayashi and Reed [SODA, 2010].#R##N##R##N#• We show that Deletion q-Horn Backdoor Set Detection is a special case of 3-Skew-Symmetric Multicut, giving us an algorithm for Deletion q-Horn Backdoor Set Detection which runs in time O(12kk5e) where k is the size of the solution and e is the length of the input formula.

1102267,15514,23634,Everywhere-Sparse Spanners via Dense Subgraphs,2012,"The significant progressg in constructing graph spanners that are sparse (small number of edges) or light (low total weight) has skipped spanners that are everywhere-sparse (small maximum degree). This disparity is in line with other network design problems, where the maximum-degree objective has been a notorious technical challenge. Our main result is for the Lowest Degree $2$-Spanner (LD2S) problem, where the goal is to compute a 2-spanner of an input graph so as to minimize the maximum degree. We design a polynomial-time algorithm achieving approximation factor O(\Delta^{3-2\sqrt{2}}) \approx O(\Delta^{0.172}), where \Delta is the maximum degree of the input graph. The previous O(\Delta^{1/4}) -- approximation was proved nearly two decades ago by Kortsarz and Peleg [SODA 1994, SICOMP 1998]. Our main conceptual contribution is to establish a formal connection between LD2S and a variant of the Densest k-Sub graph (DkS) problem. Specifically, we design for both problems strong relaxations based on the Sherali-Adams linear programming (LP) hierarchy, and show that ``faithful'' randomized rounding of the DkS-variant can be used to round LD2S solutions. Our notion of faithfulness intuitively means that all vertices and edges are chosen with probability proportional to their LP value, but the precise formulation is more subtle. Unfortunately, the best algorithms known for DkS use the Lovasz-Schrijver LP hierarchy in a non-faithful way [Bhaskara, Charikar, Chlamtac, Feige, and Vijayaraghavan, STOC 2010]. Our main technical contribution is to overcome this shortcoming, while still matching the gap that arises in random graphs by planting a sub graph with same log-density."

There has been much interest in developing models for programming active self-assembly processes in both the reconfigurable robotics community and the nanotechnology community. With respect to materials science and nanotechnology, the models proposed to date are either not yet implementable with our current understanding of synthetic chemistry or those that are implementable are limited to a set of features that do not capture the power of active components. Prior implementable models of molecular assembly only considered the passive behaviors of attaching and detaching from a complex.#R##N##R##N#Inspired by the algorithmic tile assembly model [Winfree, 1996] and the graph grammar assembly model [Klavins et al., 2004], we describe a formal model for studying the complexity of self-assembled structures with active molecular components. In particular, we add an insertion primitive and we show a direct mapping of our model to a molecular implementation using DNA. We show that the expressive power of this language is stronger than regular languages, but at most as strong as context free grammars. Here, we explore the trade-off between the complexity of the system (in terms of the number of unit types), and the behavior of the system and speed of its assembly. We find that we can grow a line of any given length n in expected time O(log3n) using O(log2n) monomers. If we grow a line with k insertion rules, either the expected final length is infinite or the expected length at time t is at most (2t + 2)"
1075851,15514,23634,Strong Backdoors to Bounded Treewidth SAT,2013,"There are various approaches to exploiting “hidden structure” in instances of hard combinatorial problems to allow faster algorithms than for general unstructured or random instances. For SAT and its counting version #SAT, hidden structure has been exploited in terms of decomposability and strong backdoor sets. Decomposability can be considered in terms of the treewidth of a graph that is associated with the given CNF formula, for instance by considering clauses and variables as vertices of the graph, and making a variable adjacent with all the clauses it appears in. On the other hand, a strong backdoor set of a CNF formula is a set of variables such that each assignment to this set moves the formula into a fixed class for which (#)SAT can be solved in polynomial time. In this paper we combine the two above approaches. In particular, we study the algorithmic question of finding a small strong backdoor set into the class Wν≤ t  of CNF formulas whose associated graphs have treewidth at most t. The main results are positive: (1) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F and two constants k, t ≥ 0, either finds a strong Wν≤ t -backdoor set of size at most 2k, or concludes that F has no strong Wν≤ t -backdoor set of size at most k. (2) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F, computes the number of satisfying assignments of F or concludes that sbt(F) > k, for any pair of constants k, t ≥ 0. Here, sbt(F) denotes the size of a smallest strong Wν≤ t -backdoor set of F. We establish both results by distinguishing between two cases, depending on whether the treewidth of the given formula is small or large. For both results the case of small treewidth can be dealt with relatively standard methods. The case of large treewidth is challenging and requires novel and sophisticated combinatorial arguments. The main tool is an auxiliary graph whose vertices represent subgraphs in F's associated graph. It captures various ways to assemble large-treewidth subgraphs in F's associated graph. This is used to show that every backdoor set of size k intersects a certain set of variables whose size is bounded by a function of k and t. For any other set of k variables, one can use the auxiliary graph to find an assignment τ to these variables such that the graph associated with F[τ] has treewidth at least t + 1. The significance of our results lies in the fact that they allow us to exploit algorithmically a hidden structure in formulas that is not accessible by any one of the two approaches (decomposability, backdoors) alone. Already a backdoor size 1 on top of treewidth 1 (i.e., sb 1 (F) = 1) entails formulas of arbitrarily large treewidth and arbitrarily large cycle cutsets (variables whose deletion makes the instance acyclic)."
1590877,15514,23735,Gait optimization for roombots modular robots — Matching simulation and reality,2013,"The design of efficient locomotion gaits for robots with many degrees of freedom is challenging and time consuming even if optimization techniques are applied. Control parameters can be found through optimization in two ways: (i) through online optimization where the performance of a robot is measured while trying different control parameters on the actual hardware and (ii) through offline optimization by simulating the robot's behavior with the help of models of the robot and its environment. In this paper, we present a hybrid optimization method that combines the best properties of online and offline optimization to efficiently find locomotion gaits for arbitrary structures. In comparison to pure online optimization, both the number of experiments using robotic hardware as well as the total time required for finding efficient locomotion gaits get highly reduced by running the major part of the optimization process in simulation using a cluster of processors. The presented example shows that even for robots with a low number of degrees of freedom the time required for optimization can be reduced by a factor of 2.5 to 30, at least, depending on how extensive the search for optimized control parameters should be. Time for hardware experiments becomes minimal. More importantly, gaits that can possibly damage the robotic hardware can be filtered before being tried in hardware. Yet in contrast to pure offline optimization, we reach well matched behavior that allows a direct transfer of locomotion gaits from simulation to hardware. This is because through a meta-optimization we adapt not only the locomotion parameters but also the parameters for simulation models of the robot and environment allowing for a good matching of the robot behavior in simulation and hardware. We validate the proposed hybrid optimization method on a structure composed of two Roombots modules with a total number of six degrees of freedom. Roombots are self-reconfigurable modular robots that can form arbitrary structures with many degrees of freedom through an integrated active connection mechanism."

Specifically, let  P  = ( P  1 ,  P  2 ,...,  P   n  ),  P   i   ∈ R for all  i , be a signal and let  C  be a constant. Our goal is to find a function  F : [ n ] → R which optimizes the following objective function:   [EQUATION]   The above optimization problem reduces to solving the following recurrence, which can be done using dynamic programming in  O ( n  2 ) time:   [EQUATION]   This recurrence arises naturally in several applications where one wants to approximate a given signal  P  with a signal  F  which ideally consists of few piecewise constant segments. Such applications include histogram construction in databases, determining DNA copy numbers in cancer cells from micro-array data, speech recognition, data mining and many others.   In this work we present two new techniques for optimizing dynamic programming that can handle cost functions not treated by other standard methods. The basis of our first algorithm is the definition of a constant-shifted variant of the objective function that can be efficiently approximated using state of the art methods for range searching. Our technique approximates the optimal value of our objective function within additive e error and runs in  O ( n  4/3+Δ  log ( U /e)) time, where Δ is an arbitrarily small positive constant and  U  = max{√ C , (| P   i  |)  i =1,...,  n  }. The second algorithm we provide solves a similar recurrence that's within a multiplicative factor of (1+e) and runs in  O ( n  log  n /e).

2403903,15514,8228,"Quick, decentralized, one-shot max function computation using timer-based selection",2014,"In several wireless sensor networks, it is of interest to determine the maximum of the sensor readings and identify the sensor responsible for it. This has been referred to as the max function computation problem in the literature. We propose a novel, decentralized, timer-based max function computation (TMC) algorithm. In it, the sensors do not transmit their readings in a centrally pre-defined sequence. Instead, they are divided into clusters. The computation occurs over two stages. In the first stage, the nodes contend with each other using a decentralized timer scheme to transmit their reading to their cluster heads. In the second stage, the cluster heads contend in a similar manner. The main challenge that arises with the use of the timer scheme is the possibility of collisions, which can make the algorithm fail in finding the maximum. We optimize the algorithm to minimize the average time required to determine the maximum subject to a constraint on the probability that it fails to find it due to collisions. Extensive benchmarking shows that TMC requires lower selection times and far fewer transmissions on average than other approaches proposed in the literature. I. INTRODUCTION While block computation reduces the number of trans- missions significantly, it does have its drawbacks. Firstly, it introduces a large delay since every node has to collect a sufficiently large number of measurements in a block, which can make it impractical (2). The block size also grows with the number of nodes in the network. Another practically relevant model that avoids the delays associated with block computa- tion is one shot computation, in which the max function is computed once in every coherence interval of the metrics (2), (5). We shall focus on one-shot computation in this paper. We propose a novel timer based max function computation (TMC) algorithm for one-shot computation, which differs markedly from the approaches pursued in the literature. Even for one-shot computation, we show that a marked reduction in the average selection time and average number of transmis- sions can be achieved."
2482132,15514,23684,An intersection model for multitolerance graphs: efficient algorithms and hierarchy,2011,"Tolerance graphs model interval relations in such a way that intervals can tolerate a certain degree of overlap without being in conflict. This class of graphs has attracted many research efforts, mainly due to its interesting structure and its numerous applications, especially in DNA sequence analysis and resource allocation, among others. In one of the most natural generalizations of tolerance graphs, namely  multitolerance  graphs, two tolerances are allowed for each interval -- one from the left and one from the right side of the interval. Then, in its interior part, every interval tolerates the intersection with others by an amount that is a convex combination of its two border-tolerances. In the comparison of DNA sequences between different organisms, the natural interpretation of this model lies on the fact that, in some applications, we may want to treat several parts of the genomic sequences differently. That is, we may want to be more tolerant at some parts of the sequences than at others. These two tolerances for every interval -- together with their convex hull -- define an infinite number of the so called  tolerance-intervals , which make the multitolerance model inconvenient to cope with. In this article we introduce the first non-trivial intersection model for multitolerance graphs, given by objects in the 3-dimensional space called  trapezoepipeds . Apart from being important on its own, this new intersection model proves to be a powerful tool for designing efficient algorithms. Given a multitolerance graph with  n  vertices and  m  edges, we present algorithms that compute a minimum coloring and a maximum clique in optimal  O ( n log  n ) time, and a maximum weight independent set in  O ( m  +  n  log  n ) time. Moreover, our results imply an optimal  O ( n  log  n ) time algorithm for the maximum weight independent set problem on tolerance graphs, thus closing the complexity gap for this problem. Additionally, by exploiting more the new 3D-intersection model, we completely classify multitolerance graphs in the hierarchy of perfect graphs."

Our data structure for an n x n Monge matrix takes O(n log n) space, O(n log2 n) preprocessing time, and can answer queries in O(log2 n) time. For a Monge partial matrix the space bound and the preprocessing time both grow by the small factor α(n), where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function. Our design exploits an interpretation of the column maxima in a Monge matrix (resp., Monge partial matrix) as an upper envelope of pseudo-lines (resp., pseudo-segments).#R##N##R##N#We give two applications for this data structure: (1) For a set of n points in a rectangle B in the plane, we build a data structure that, given a query point p, returns the largest-area empty axis-parallel rectangle contained in B and containing p, in O(log4 n) time. The preprocessing time is O(nα(n) log4 n), and the space required is O(nα(n) log3 n). This improves substantially a previous data structure of Augustine et al. [arXiv: 1004.0558] that requires quadratic space. (2) Given an n-node arbitrarily weighted planar digraph, with possibly negative edge weights, we build, in O(n log2 n/log log n) time, a linear-size data structure that supports edge-weight updates and distance queries between arbitrary pairs of nodes (where the distance is minimum weight of a path in the graph between the pair of nodes), in O(n2/3 log5/3n) time for each update and query. This improves the O(n4/5 log13/5n)-time bound of Fakcharoenphol and Rao [JCSS 72, 2006].

888928,15514,23735,Design and control of a spherical omnidirectional blimp,2013,"This paper presents Skye, a novel blimp design. Skye is a helium-filled sphere of diameter 2.7m with a strong inelastic outer hull and an impermeable elastic inner hull. Four tetrahedrally-arranged actuation units (AU) are mounted on the hull for locomotion, with each AU having a thruster which can be rotated around a radial axis through the sphere center. This design provides redundant control in the six degrees of freedom of motion, and Skye is able to move omnidirectionally and to rotate around any axis. A multi-camera module is also mounted on the hull for capture of aerial imagery or live video stream according to an `eyeball' concept - the camera module is not itself actuated, but the whole blimp is rotated in order to obtain a desired camera view. Skye is safe for use near people - the double hull minimizes the likelihood of rupture on an unwanted collision; the propellers are covered by grills to prevent accidental contact; and the blimp is near neutral buoyancy so that it makes only a light impact on contact and can be readily nudged away. The system is portable and deployable by a single operator - the electronics, AUs, and camera unit are mounted externally and are detachable from the hull during transport; operator control is via an intuitive touchpad interface. The motivating application is in entertainment robotics. Skye has a varied motion vocabulary such as swooping and bobbing, plus internal LEDs for visual effect. Computer vision enables interaction with an audience. Experimental results show dexterous maneuvers in indoor and outdoor environments, and non-dangerous impacts between the blimp and humans."

A new insect-based hovering control strategy is presented here for accurately stabilizing the position of a sighted twin-rotor equipped with a decoupled eye with a narrow field-of-view of only a few degrees. The main aim of this paper is to describe how accurately hovering flight above a target can be achieved by means of this fundamental bio-inspired mechanical decoupling system between the eye and the body. The simulated gaze control system implemented on-board the aerial robot has several advantages : — it enables the robot's gaze to be stabilized on the basis of three bio-inspired oculomotor reflexes (ORs) : a visual fixation reflex (VFR), a translational reflex and a rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex (tVOR and rVOR), — it makes the eye compensate quickly and accurately for any sudden, untoward disturbances caused by the vagaries of the supporting head or body, — it provides a reference visual signal to compensate for the rate gyro drift used to implement the VORs and to stabilize the hovering robot, — it greatly improves the stability of the robot's roll during voluntary lateral displacements with respect to the target. Close comparisons were made between two simulated robots with and without a decoupled eye, which were both subjected to strong lateral and roll disturbances. The simulations show that the robot with a decoupled eye can reject disturbances twice as fast as that with a fixed eye. This innovative bio-inspired hovering control method stabilizes the robot's attitude without any need for accelerometers, magnetometers or classical inertial measurement units."

Area laws provide a fundamental ingredient in the study of the complexity of ground states, since they offer a way to bound in a quantitative way the entanglement in such states. Although they have long been conjectured for many body systems in arbitrary dimensions, a general rigorous was only recently proved in Hastings' seminal paper \cite{ref:Has07} for 1D systems. In this paper, we give a combinatorial proof of the 1D area law for the special case of frustration free systems, improving by an exponential factor the scaling in terms of the inverse spectral gap and the dimensionality of the particles. The scaling in terms of the dimension of the particles is a potentially important issue in the context of resolving the 2D case and higher dimensions, which is one of the most important open questions in Hamiltonian complexity. Our proof is based on a reformulation of the detectability lemma, introduced by us in the context of quantum gap amplification\cite{ref:Aha09b}. We give an alternative proof of the detectability lemma, which is not only simpler and more intuitive than the original proof, but also removes a key restriction in the original statement, making it more suitable for this new context. We also give a one page proof of Hastings' proof that the correlations in the ground states of gapped Hamiltonians decay exponentially with the distance, demonstrating the simplicity of the combinatorial approach for those problems."
881040,15514,23634,Faster Canonical Forms for Strongly Regular Graphs,2013,"We show that a canonical form for strongly regular (s. r.) graphs can be found in time exp(Õ(n 1/5 ))and therefore isomorphism of s. r. graphs can be tested within the same time bound, where n is the number of vertices and the tilde hides a polylogarithmic factor. The best previous bound for testing isomorphism of s. r. graphs was exp(Õ(n 1/3 )) (Spielman, STOC 1996) while the bound for GI in general has been standing lirmly at exp(Õ(n 1/2 )) for three decades. (These results, too, provided canonical forms.) The previous bounds on isomorphism of s. r. graphs (Babai 1980 and Spielman 1996) were based on the analysis of the classical individualization/relinement (I/R) heuristic. The present bound depends on a combination of a deeper analysis of the I/R heuristic with Luks's group theoretic divide-and-conquer methods following BabaiLuks (STOC 1983) and Miller (1983). Our analysis builds on Spielman's work that brought Neumaier's 1979 classilication of s. r. graphs to bear on the problem. One of Neumaier's classes, the line-graphs of Steiner 2-designs, has been eliminated as a bottleneck in recent work by the present authors (STOC'13). In the remaining hard cases, we have the benelit of “Neumaier's claw bound” and its asymptotic consequences derived by Spielman, some of which we improve via a new “clique geometry.” We also prove, by an analysis of the I/R heuristic, that, with known (trivial) exceptions, s. r. graphs have exp(Õ(n 9/37 )) automorphisms, improving Spielman's exp(Õ(n 1/3 )) bound. No knowledge of group theory is required for this paper. The group theoretic method is only used through an easily stated combinatorial consequence (Babai-Luks, 1983 combined with Miller, 1983). While the bulk of this paper is joint work by the live authors, it also includes two contributions by subsets of the authors: the clique geometry [BW] and the automorphism bound [CST]."

The leakage-resilience limit of a cryptographic assumption, and hence of a computational search problem, is the maximal number of bits of information that can be leaked (adaptively) about an instance, without making the problem easy to solve. This implies security of the underlying scheme against arbitrary side channel attacks by a computationally unbounded adversary as long as the number of leaked bits of information is less than the leakage resilience limit.#R##N##R##N#The hardness of a computational problem is typically characterized by the running time of the fastest (known) algorithm for solving it. We propose to consider, as another natural complexity-theoretic quantity, the success probability of the best polynomial-time algorithm (which can be exponentially small). We refer to its negative logarithm as the unpredictability entropy of the problem (which is defined up to an additive logarithmic term).#R##N##R##N#A main result of the paper is that the leakage-resilience limit and the unpredictability entropy are equal. This demonstrates, for the first time, the practical relevance of studying polynomial-time algorithms even for problems believed to be hard, and even if the success probability is too small to be of practical interest. With this view, we look at the best probabilistic polynomial time algorithms for the learning with errors and lattice problems that have in recent years gained relevance in cryptography.#R##N##R##N#We also introduce the concept of witness compression for computational problems, namely the reduction of a problem to another problem for which the witnesses are shorter. The length of the smallest achievable witness for a problem also corresponds to the non-adaptive leakage-resilience limit, and it is also shown to be equal to the unpredictability entropy of the problem. The witness compression concept is also of independent theoretical interest. An example of an implication of our result is that 3-SAT for n variables can be witness compressed from n bits (the variable assignments) to 0.41 n bits."

Further, we establish a rather strongnegative result: all known graph theoretic bounds are within alogarithmic factor from the chromatic number. This is in strikingcontrast to minrank since prior work has shown that it canoutperform the chromatic number by a polynomial factor insome cases. The conclusion is that all known graph theoreticbounds are not much stronger than the chromatic number. I. I NTRODUCTION Index coding is a fundamental network information theoryproblem with deep connections with combinatorial optimiza-tion and graph theory [1]–[6]. Interest in index coding is fur-ther increasing due to two recent developments: The ﬁrst is thatit was recently shown [7], [8] that any arbitrary network codingproblem with potentially multiple sources and receivers canbe mapped to a properly constructed index coding instance.Therefore, statements about index coding can be translatedto constructions or bounds for general networks, showing thesurprising expressiveness of the problem. Second, interferencealignment alongside information theoretic approaches havebeen recently applied for index coding [5], [6], [9]–[11]introducing new interesting techniques for code constructions.Brieﬂy, index coding is a noiseless broadcast problem where mmessages needs to be sent to nusers each requesting one of themmessages. In addition, every user has some side informationpackets which is a subset of the mmessages not including therequest.

679866,15514,65,Design of a physiologically informed virtual reality based interactive platform for individuals with upper limb impairment,2014,"A large number of stroke-surviving individuals exhibit deficits related to upper limb movement, thereby making post stroke rehabilitation a critical part of patients' health care system. The patients are typically treated with conventional occupational therapy at the hospital after stroke. However, due to economic pressures and limited health care resources often the patients receive less therapy than required causing them to be deprived of the potential therapeutic benefits. Thus implementing a cost-effective home based technology-assisted rehabilitation system which is capable of providing intensive, adaptive and individualized rehabilitation service is critical. Virtual reality (VR) based rehabilitation system seems to address this challenge effectively. VR technology for rehabilitation allows us to create an interactive environment with precise control over intensity of practice that influence one's motor control in an individualized manner. In this study we developed an interactive VR-based platform which challenges the coordination skill of individuals with upper limb impairment. Additionally, we used patient's physiological indices to understand their stress level while they interact with the VR-based rehabilitation environment. The system developed in this work is a first step to understand its potential to provide individualized home-based rehabilitative service with minimal dependency on physiotherapist. In our initial study designed as a proof-of-concept application, one stroke-surviving patient participated in the interactive VR-based task. The preliminary results obtained from this initial study indicate the potential of mapping one's stress level to his physiological indices. Thus these results indicate the potential applicability of such a system for various stroke-rehabilitation applications"
1243511,15514,9748,Performance Tuning on Multicore Systems for Feature Matching within Image Collections,2013,"Parallel programming is the mainstream for today's HPC applications. Programmers need to parallelize their programs to achieve better performance on multicore systems. However, due to a lack of good understanding of parallelism in algorithms, scheduling policy in runtime systems, and multicore architectures, programmers usually find it very hard to write high-performance, scalable programs on these parallel platforms. Although using a parallelized library written by experts can reduce the amount of work for coding, it does not automatically guarantee good performance according to our study. A better understanding of parallelism in algorithms, the OS/runtime systems, and hardware architectures is necessary if programmers wish to further improve performance. In this paper, we use SIFT-based feature matching within large-scale image collections to show the importance of three factors-the level of parallelism, scheduling policy, and memory architecture-that affect the performance of large-scale feature matching on multicore systems. We demonstrate experimental results using programs based on OpenCV and OpenMP, which are executed on both 16-core and 64-core machines. From our experimental results, we find that images with a large number of features achieve poor scalability on the 64-core machine due to a poor cache utilization. To address this issue of cache performance, we propose a Divide-and-Merge algorithm that divides the feature space into several small sub-spaces so that they fit within the cache. Our experiments show that the performance tuning addressing all of the three factors improves the speedup of feature matching from 10.6× to 21.5× on the 64-core machine. While the speedup is improved by 103%, the scalability of the feature matching algorithm is improved by up to 6.45 times on the 64-core machine with our performance tuning. Our study indicates that performance tuning on multicore systems is very challenging even for a simple image processing algorithm."
2425752,15514,23634,"Justifications, Awareness and Epistemic Dynamics",2013,"The paper introduces a new kind of models for the logic of proofs LP, the group justification models. While being an elaboration of Fitting models, the group justification models are a special case of the models of general awareness. Soundness and completeness results of LP with respect to the new semantics are established. The paper also offers an interpretation of the group models, which pertains to awareness and group epistemic dynamics. Recent developments in justification logic include contributions to what may be called foundational research. This line of research stems from the fact that the usual kinds of semantics for justification logic (6,11,13) do not provide a specific interpretation of justification terms (let us call this 'the interpretation problem'). An interesting solution to the interpretation problem are Artemov's modular models (5), where terms are interpreted as sets of formulas. This paper treats the issue along different lines. It offers a solution to the interpretation problem that utilises the notion of awareness and pertains to in- formation dynamics as well. From our viewpoint, justification terms describe epistemic actions within specific groups of agents. As such, these actions result in alternations of awareness and explicit knowledge of the agents in the group. Justification formulas (t)F describe outcomes of such actions: the action corre- sponding to t results in F being explicitly known in the group corresponding to t. More specifically, justification formulas are seen as instructions for obtaining universal explicit knowledge in a group of agents. The connection with awareness has been there for a long time: the Fitting semantics for justification logic (11) bears a strong resemblance to the semantics of the logic of general awareness (9). 1 The connection with information dynam- ics stems from the fact that justification operations have an obvious dynamic flavour. You can see the operations as types of actions that create complex jus- tifications from simpler ones. 1 This fact has been pointed out many times in the justification logic literature (most notably in (12)). However, a closer analysis of the connection between these two branches of epistemic logic remains to be carried out."
1319614,15514,23634,A Unified Continuous Greedy Algorithm for Submodular Maximization,2011,"The study of combinatorial problems with a sub modular objective function has attracted much attention in recent years, and is partly motivated by the importance of such problems to economics, algorithmic game theory and combinatorial optimization. Classical works on these problems are mostly combinatorial in nature. Recently, however, many results based on continuous algorithmic tools have emerged. The main bottleneck of such continuous techniques is how to approximately solve a non-convex relaxation for the sub modular problem at hand. Thus, the efficient computation of better fractional solutions immediately implies improved approximations for numerous applications. A simple and elegant method, called ``continuous greedy'', successfully tackles this issue for monotone sub modular objective functions, however, only much more complex tools are known to work for general non-monotone sub modular objectives. In this work we present a new unified continuous greedy algorithm which finds approximate fractional solutions for both the non-monotone and monotone cases, and improves on the approximation ratio for many applications. For general non-monotone sub modular objective functions, our algorithm achieves an improved approximation ratio of about $1/e$. For monotone sub modular objective functions, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio that depends on the density of the poly tope defined by the problem at hand, which is always at least as good as the previously known best approximation ratio of $1 - 1/e$. Some notable immediate implications are an improved $1/e$-approximation for maximizing a non-monotone sub modular function subject to a matroid or $O(1)$-knapsack constraints, and information-theoretic tight approximations for Sub modular Max-SAT and Sub modular Welfare with $k$ players, for {\em any} number of players $k$. A framework for sub modular optimization problems, called the \emph{contention resolution framework}, was introduced recently by Chekuri et al. The improved approximation ratio of the unified continuous greedy algorithm implies improved approximation ratios for many problems through this framework. Moreover, via a parameter called \emph{stopping time}, our algorithm merges the relaxation solving and re-normalization steps of the framework, and achieves, for some applications, further improvements. We also describe new monotone balanced contention resolution schemes for various matching, scheduling and packing problems, thus, improving the approximations achieved for these problems via the framework."
1716402,15514,23684,Slightly superexponential parameterized problems,2011,"A central problem in parameterized algorithms is to obtain algorithms with running time  f ( k ) ·  n   O (1)  such that  f  is as slow growing function of the parameter  k  as possible. In particular, the first natural goal is to make  f ( k ) single-exponential, that is,  c   k   for some constant  c . This has led to the development of parameterized algorithms for various problems where  f ( k ) appearing in their running time is of form 2  O ( k ) . However there are still plenty of problems where the slightly superexponential  f ( k ) appearing in the best known running time has remained non single-exponential even after a lot of attempts to bring it down. A natural question to ask is whether the  f ( k ) appearing in the running time of the best-known algorithms is optimal for any of these problems.   In this paper, we examine parameterized problems where  f ( k ) is  k   O ( k )  = 2  O ( k  log  k )  in the best known running time and for a number of such problems, we show that the dependence on  k  in the running time cannot be improved to single exponential. More precisely we prove following tight lower bounds, for three natural problems, arising from three different domains:   • The pattern matching problem Closest String is known to be solvable in time 2  O ( d  log  d )  ·  n   O (1)  and 2  O ( d  log|Σ|)  ·  n   O (1) . We show that there is no 2  o ( d  log  d )  · n  O (1)  and 2  o ( d log|Σ|)  ·  n   O (1)  time algorithm, unless Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails.   • The graph embedding problem Distortion, that is, deciding whether a graph  G  has a metric embedding into the integers with distortion at most  d  can be done in time 2  O ( d  log  d )  ·  n   O (1) . We show that there is no 2  o ( d  log  d )  ·  n   O (1)  time algorithm, unless ETH fails.   • The Disjoint Paths problem can be solved in time in time 2  O ( w  log  w )  ·  n   O (1)  on graphs of treewidth at most  w . We show that there is no 2  o ( w  log  w )  ·  n   O (1)  time algorithm, unless ETH fails.   To obtain our result we first prove the lower bound for variants of basic problems: finding cliques, independent sets, and hitting sets. These artificially constrained variants form a good starting point for proving lower bounds on natural problems without any technical restrictions and could be of independent interest. We believe that many further results of this form can be obtained by using the framework of the current paper."
751728,15514,23735,Multi-cost Robotic Motion Planning Under Uncertainty,2014,"This paper describes an algorithm for robotic motion planning that is capable of optimising several cost functions simultaneously to provide optimised, feasible and collision-free paths. The algorithm is based on the best-first graph search algorithm using a Pareto frontier to evaluate costs at each node. Additionally, we include a calculation of the distribution of robot trajectories when the path is realised using a LQR based controller. This ensures that the possibility of collisions is greatly reduced. Results are provided that show multi-cost robotic path planning under position uncertainty and control constraints whilst simultaneously optimising distance travelled and fuel spent. I. INTRODUCTION When creating a motion plan for a robotic vehicle, it is desirable to choose the shortest path to ensure quick execution of the mission. It is also desirable to ensure the vehicle can localise itself with enough precision such that it does not collide with objects in the environment. To achieve this, the vehicle may have to deviate from the obvious shortest path solution. For example, a robot may need to move into open space to obtain a good GPS fix. Furthermore, a robot may have other constraints such as the fuel remaining, shock loading, weather conditions or daylight available that could have an impact on it completing the mission. It is therefore necessary to optimise a motion plan that considers all mission constraints as costs. We therefore propose that a multi-dimensional cost function is required to generate feasible and optimised paths for robotic vehicles to maximise the mission success. Robotic path planning research has traditionally focussed"

705377,15514,9475,"Online advertisement, optimization and stochastic networks",2011,"In this paper, we propose a stochastic model to describe how search service providers charge client companies based on users' queries for the keywords related to these companies' ads by using certain advertisement assignment strategies. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the long-term average revenue for the service provider under each client's long-term average budget constraint and design an online algorithm which captures the stochastic properties of users' queries and click-through behaviors. We solve the optimization problem by making connections to scheduling problems in wireless networks, queueing theory and stochastic networks. Unlike prior models, we do not assume that the number of query arrivals is known. Due to the stochastic nature of the arrival process considered here, either temporary “free” service, i.e., service above the specified budget (which we call “overdraft”) or under-utilization of the budget (which we call “underdraft”) is unavoidable. We prove that our online algorithm can achieve a revenue that is within  O (e) of the optimal revenue while ensuring that the overdraft or underdraft is  O (1/e) , where e can be arbitrarily small. With a view towards practice, we can show that one can always operate strictly under the budget. In addition, we extend our results to a click-through rate maximization model and also show how our algorithm can be modified to handle non-stationary query arrival processes and clients with short-term contracts. Our algorithm also allows us to quantify the effect of errors in click-through rate estimation on the achieved revenue. We show that we lose at most Δ/1+Δ fraction of the revenue if Δ is the relative error in click-through rate estimation. We also show that in the long run, an expected overdraft level of Ω(log(1/e)) is unavoidable (a universal lower bound) under any stationary ad assignment algorithm which achieves a long-term average revenue within  O (e) of the offline optimum."
1432287,15514,23634,Delays and the Capacity of Continuous-Time Channels,2011,"Any physical channel of communication offers two potential reasons why its capacity (the number of bits it can transmit in a unit of time) might be unbounded: (1) (Uncountably) infinitely many choices of signal strength at any given instant of time, and (2) (Uncountably) infinitely many instances of time at which signals may be sent. However channel noise cancels out the potential unboundedness of the first aspect, leaving typical channels with only a finite capacity per instant of time. The latter source of infinity seems less extensively studied. A potential source of unreliability that might restrict the capacity also from the second aspect is ``delay'': Signals transmitted by the sender at a given point of time may not be received with a predictable delay at the receiving end. In this work we examine this source of uncertainty by considering a simple discrete model of delay errors. In our model the communicating parties get to subdivide time as microscopically finely as they wish, but still have to cope with communication delays that are macroscopic and variable. The continuous process becomes the limit of our process as the time subdivision becomes infinitesimal. We taxonomize this class of communication channels based on whether the delays and noise are stochastic or adversarial, and based on how much information each aspect has about the other when introducing its errors. We analyze the limits of such channels and reach somewhat surprising conclusions: The capacity of a physical channel is finitely bounded only if at least one of the two sources of error (signal noise or delay noise) is adversarial. In particular the capacity is finitely bounded only if the delay is adversarial, or the noise is adversarial and acts with knowledge of the stochastic delay. If both error sources are stochastic, or if the noise is adversarial and independent of the stochastic delay, then the capacity of the associated physical channel is infinite!"

1055927,15514,23836,Optimizing Bandwidth Allocation in Flex-Grid Optical Networks with Application to Scheduling,2014,"All-optical networks have been largely investigated due to their high data transmission rates. In the traditional Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology, the spectrum of light that can be transmitted through the optical fiber has been divided into frequency intervals of fixed width, with a gap of unused frequencies between them. Recently, an alternative emerging architecture was suggested which moves away from the rigid Dense WDM (DWDM) model towards a flexible model, where usable frequency intervals are of variable width (even within the same link). Each light path has to be assigned a frequency interval (sub-spectrum), which remains fixed through all of the links it traverses. Two different light paths using the same link must be assigned disjoint sub-spectra. This technology is termed flex-grid (or, flex-spectrum), as opposed to fixed-grid (or, fixed-spectrum) current technology. In this work we study a problem of optimal bandwidth allocation arising in the flex-grid technology. In this setting, each light path has a lower and upper bound on the width of its frequency interval, as well as an associated profit, and we want to find a bandwidth assignment that maximizes the total profit. This problem is known to be NP-Complete. We observe that, in fact, the problem is inapproximable within any constant ratio even on a path network. We further derive NP-hardness results and present approximation algorithms for several special cases of the path and ring networks, which are of practical interest. Finally, while in general our problem is hard to approximate, we show that an optimal solution can be obtained by allowing resource augmentation. Our study has applications also in real time scheduling."

We take the approach of exploiting problem structure to achieve better results, by providing a geometry-inspired algorithm whose approximation guarantee depends solely on an instance-specific combinatorial property known as shallow cell complexity (SCC). Roughly speaking, a set cover instance has low SCC if any column-induced submatrix of the corresponding element-set incidence matrix has few distinct rows. By adapting and improving Varadarajan's recent quasi-uniform random sampling method for weighted geometric covering problems, we obtain strong approximation algorithms for a structurally rich class of weighted covering problems with low SCC. We also show how to derandomize our algorithm.#R##N##R##N#Our main result has several immediate consequences. Among them, we settle an open question of Chakrabarty et al. [8] by showing that weighted instances of the capacitated covering problem with underlying network structure have O(1)-approximations. Additionally, our improvements to Varadarajan's sampling framework yield several new results for weighted geometric set cover, hitting set, and dominating set problems. In particular, for weighted covering problems exhibiting linear (or near-linear) union complexity, we obtain approximability results agreeing with those known for the unweighted case. For example, we obtain a constant approximation for the weighted disk cover problem, improving upon the 2O(log* n)-approximation known prior to our work and matching the O(1)-approximation known for the unweighted variant."
1325352,15514,65,The wouse: A wearable wince detector to stop assistive robots,2012,"Persons with severe motor impairments depend heavily upon caregivers for the performance of everyday tasks. Ongoing work is exploring the potential of giving motor-impaired users control of semi-autonomous assistive mobile manipulators to enable them to perform some self-care tasks such as scratching or shaving. Because these users are less able to escape a robot malfunction, or operate a traditional run-stop, physical human-robot interaction poses safety risks. We review approaches to safety in assistive robotics with a focus on accessible run-stops, and propose wincing as an accessible gesture for activating a run-stop device. We also present the wouse, a novel device for detecting wincing from skin movement near the eye, consisting of optical mouse components mounted near a user's temple via safety goggles. Using this device, we demonstrate a complete system to run-stop a Willow Garage PR2 robot, and perform two preliminary user studies. The first study examines discrimination of wincing from self-produced facial expressions. The results indicate the possibility for discrimination, though variability between users and inconsistent detection of skin movement remain significant challenges. The second experiment examines discrimination of wincing from external mechanical manipulations of the face during self-care tasks. The results indicate that the wouse, using a classifier trained with data from the first experiment, can be used during face-manipulation tasks. The device produced no false positives, but succeeded in correctly identifying wincing events in only two of four subjects."
1060631,15514,23634,Approximation Algorithms for Correlated Knapsacks and Non-martingale Bandits,2011,"In the stochastic knapsack problem, we are given a knapsack of size B, and a set of items whose sizes and rewards are drawn from a known probability distribution. To know the actual size and reward we have to schedule the item -- when it completes, we get to know these values. The goal is to schedule the items (possibly making adaptive decisions based on the sizes seen so far) to maximize the expected total reward of items which successfully pack into the knapsack. We know constant-factor approximations when (i) the rewards and sizes are independent, and (ii) we cannot prematurely cancel items after we schedule them. What if either or both assumptions are relaxed? Related stochastic packing problems are the multi-armed bandit (and budgeted learning) problems, here one is given several arms which evolve in a specified stochastic fashion with each pull, and the goal is to (adaptively) decide which arms to pull, in order to maximize the expected reward obtained after B pulls in total. Much recent work on this problem focuses on the case when the evolution of each arm follows a martingale, i.e., when the expected reward from one pull of an arm is the same as the reward at the current state. What if the rewards do not form a martingale? In this paper, we give O(1)-approximation algorithms for the stochastic knapsack problem with correlations and/or cancellations. Extending the ideas developed here, we give O(1)-approximations for MAB problems without the martingale assumption. Indeed, we can show that previously proposed linear programming relaxations for these problems have large integrality gaps. So we propose new time-indexed LP relaxations, using a decomposition and gap-filling approach, we convert these fractional solutions to distributions over strategies, and then use the LP values and the time ordering information from these strategies to devise randomized adaptive scheduling algorithms."

Previous studies focus on Multi Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) which feeds a set of active voxels in a concatenated vector form to a machine learning algorithm to train and classify the cognitive processes. In most of the MVPA methods, after an image preprocessing step, the voxel intensity values are fed to a classifier to train and recognize the underlying cognitive process. Sometimes, the fMRI data is further processed for de-noising or feature selection where techniques, such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) or Principal Component Analysis are employed. Although these techniques are proved to be useful in MVPA, they do not model the spatial connectivity among the voxels. In this study, we attempt to represent the local relations among the voxel intensity values by forming a mesh network around each voxel to model the relationship of a voxel and its surroundings. The degree of connectivity of a voxel to its surroundings is represented by the arc weights of each mesh. The arc weights, which are estimated by a linear regression model, are fed to a classifier to discriminate the brain states during an object recognition task. This approach, called Mesh Learning, provides a powerful tool to analyze various cognitive states using fMRI data. Compared to traditional studies which focus either merely on multi-voxel pattern vectors or their reduced-dimension versions, the suggested Mesh Learning provides a better representation of object recognition task. Various machine learning algorithms are tested to compare the suggested Mesh Learning to the state-of-the art MVPA techniques. The performance of the Mesh Learning is shown to be higher than that of the available MVPA techniques."
867462,15514,23634,Mechanism Design for Crowdsourcing: An Optimal 1-1/e Competitive Budget-Feasible Mechanism for Large Markets,2014,"In this paper we consider a mechanism design problem in the context of large-scale crowdsourcing markets such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk mturk, ClickWorker clickworker, CrowdFlower crowdflower. In these markets, there is a requester who wants to hire workers to accomplish some tasks. Each worker is assumed to give some utility to the requester on getting hired. Moreover each worker has a minimum cost that he wants to get paid for getting hired. This minimum cost is assumed to be private information of the workers. The question then is -- if the requester has a limited budget, how to design a direct revelation mechanism that picks the right set of workers to hire in order to maximize the requester's utility? We note that although the previous work (Singer (2010) chen et al. (2011)) has studied this problem, a crucial difference in which we deviate from earlier work is the notion of large-scale markets that we introduce in our model. Without the large market assumption, it is known that no mechanism can achieve a competitive ratio better than 0.414 and 0.5 for deterministic and randomized mechanisms respectively (while the best known deterministic and randomized mechanisms achieve an approximation ratio of 0.292 and 0.33 respectively). In this paper, we design a budget-feasible mechanism for large markets that achieves a competitive ratio of 1 -- 1/e = 0.63. Our mechanism can be seen as a generalization of an alternate way to look at the proportional share mechanism, which is used in all the previous works so far on this problem. Interestingly, we can also show that our mechanism is optimal by showing that no truthful mechanism can achieve a factor better than 1 -- 1/e, thus, fully resolving this setting. Finally we consider the more general case of submodular utility functions and give new and improved mechanisms for the case when the market is large."
1097172,15514,23735,Anticipating human activities for reactive robotic response,2013,"An important aspect of human perception is anticipation, which we use extensively in our day-to-day activities when interacting with other humans as well as with our surroundings. Anticipating which activities will a human do next (and how to do them) can enable an assistive robot to plan ahead for reactive responses in the human environments. In this work, our goal is to enable robots to predict the future activities as well as the details of how a human is going to perform them in short-term (e.g., 1-10 seconds). For example, if a robot has seen a person move his hand to a coffee mug, it is possible he would move the coffee mug to a few potential places such as his mouth, to a kitchen sink or just move it to a different location on the table. If a robot can anticipate this, then it would rather not start pouring milk into the coffee when the person is moving his hand towards the mug, thus avoiding a spill. We represent each possible future using an anticipatory temporal conditional random field (ATCRF) that models the rich spatial-temporal relations through object affordances. We then consider each ATCRF as a particle and represent the distribution over the potential futures using a set of particles. We evaluate our anticipation approach extensively on CAD-120 human activity dataset, which contains 120 RGB-D videos of daily human activities, such as microwaving food, taking medicine, etc. For robotic evaluation, we measure how many times the robot anticipates and performs the correct reactive response. The accompanying video shows a PR2 robot performing assistive tasks based on the anticipations generated by our proposed method."
2702463,15514,23684,"Maintaining assignments online: matching, scheduling, and flows",2014,"Consider the following edge-orientation problem: edges of a graph appear online one-by-one and they to be directed---given an orientation. We want to ensure that the in-degree of each vertex remains low. (This is a simple case of scheduling unit-sized jobs on machines, where each job can only go on one of two machines.) If the edge-orientations we assign are irrevocable, we suffer a significant loss in quality due to online decision-making (as compared to the offline performance). For instance the best online competitive ratio achievable is Θ(log m) for even this toy problem.#R##N##R##N#But what if the decisions are not irrevocable --- what if we allow a limited number of reassignments? Can we do much better? We show that indeed we can. For instance, for edge-orientation, we can achieve a constant-competitive load while doing only a constant number of re-orientations per edge (in an amortized sense). For more substantial problems, our results are as follows:#R##N##R##N#• For online matching, where the left vertices arrive online and must be matched to the right vertices, we give an algorithm that reassigns the left vertices an (amortized) constant number of times, and maintains a constant factor to the optimal load on the right vertices. We extend this to restricted machine scheduling with arbitrary sized jobs and give an algorithm that maintains load which is O(log log mn) times the optimum, and reassigns each job only an (amortized) constant number of times.#R##N##R##N#• Consider a digraph with a single source, where sinks arrive online and want to send unit flow to the source. The goal is to minimize the congestion on the edges. Suppose there is an offline flow such that the total length of the flow paths is F*. We give an algorithm that reroutes flow along O(F*) edges and achieves a O(1)-approximation to the congestion."
2092698,15514,8960,A provable SVD-based algorithm for learning topics in dominant admixture corpus,2014,"Topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), posit that documents are drawn from admixtures of distributions over words, known as topics. The inference problem of recovering topics from such a collection of documents drawn from admixtures, is NP-hard. Making a strong assumption called separability, [4] gave the first provable algorithm for inference. For the widely used LDA model, [6] gave a provable algorithm using clever tensor-methods. But [4, 6] do not learn topic vectors with bounded l1 error (a natural measure for probability vectors).#R##N##R##N#Our aim is to develop a model which makes intuitive and empirically supported assumptions and to design an algorithm with natural, simple components such as SVD, which provably solves the inference problem for the model with bounded l1 error. A topic in LDA and other models is essentially characterized by a group of co-occurring words. Motivated by this, we introduce topic specific Catchwords, a group of words which occur with strictly greater frequency in a topic than any other topic individually and are required to have high frequency together rather than individually. A major contribution of the paper is to show that under this more realistic assumption, which is empirically verified on real corpora, a singular value decomposition (SVD) based algorithm with a crucial pre-processing step of thresholding, can provably recover the topics from a collection of documents drawn from Dominant admixtures. Dominant admixtures are convex combination of distributions in which one distribution has a significantly higher contribution than the others. Apart from the simplicity of the algorithm, the sample complexity has near optimal dependence on w0, the lowest probability that a topic is dominant, and is better than [4]. Empirical evidence shows that on several real world corpora, both Catchwords and Dominant admixture assumptions hold and the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms the state of the art [5]."
1144413,15514,23735,Design of omnidirectional mobile robots with ACROBAT wheel mechanisms,2013,"In this paper, we study the design of omnidirectional mobile robots with Active-Caster RObotic drive with BAll Transmission (ACROBAT). ACROBAT system has been developed by the authors group which realizes mechanical coordination of wheel and steering motions for creating caster behaviors without computer calculations. A motion in the specific direction relative to a robot body is fully depends on the motion of a specific motor. This feature gives a robot designer to build an omnidirectional mobile robot propelled by active-casters with no redundant actuation with a simple control. A controller of the robot becomes as simple as that for omni-wheeled robotic bases. Namely 3DOF of the omnidirectional robot is controlled by three motors using a simple and constant kinematics. ACROBAT includes a unique dual-ball transmission to transmit traction power to rotate and orient a drive wheel with distributing velocity components to wheel and steering axes in an appropriate ratio. Therefore a sensor for measuring a wheel orientation and calculations for velocity distributions are totally removed from a conventional control system. To build an omnidirectional vehicle by ACROBAT, the significant feature is some multiple drive shafts can be driven by a common motor which realizes non-redundant actuation of the robotic platform. A kinematic model of the proposed robot with ACROBAT is analyzed and a mechanical condition for realizing a non-redundant actuation is derived. Based on the kinematic model and the mechanical condition, computer simulations of the mechanism are performed. A prototype two-wheeled robot with two ACROBATs is designed and built to verify the availability of the proposed system. In the experiments, the prototype robot shows successful omnidirectional motions with a simple and constant kinematics based control."
715856,15514,20524,Exploiting ensemble techniques for automatic virtual machine clustering in cloud systems,2014,"Cloud computing has recently emerged as a new paradigm to provide computing services through large-size data centers where customers may run their applications in a virtualized environment. The advantages of cloud in terms of flexibility and economy encourage many enterprises to migrate from local data centers to cloud platforms, thus contributing to the success of such infrastructures. However, as size and complexity of cloud infrastructures grow, scalability issues arise in monitoring and management processes. Scalability issues are exacerbated because available solutions typically consider each virtual machine (VM) as a black box with independent characteristics, which is monitored at a fine-grained granularity level for management purposes, thus generating huge amounts of data to handle. We claim that scalability issues can be addressed by leveraging the similarity between VMs in terms of resource usage patterns. In this paper, we propose an automated methodology to cluster similar VMs starting from their resource usage information, assuming no knowledge of the software executed on them. This is an innovative methodology that combines the Bhattacharyya distance and ensemble techniques to provide a stable evaluation of similarity between probability distributions of multiple VM resource usage, considering both system- and network-related data. We evaluate the methodology through a set of experiments on data coming from an enterprise data center. We show that our proposal achieves high and stable performance in automatic VMs clustering, with a significant reduction in the amount of data collected which allows to lighten the monitoring requirements of a cloud data center."
1323231,15514,23684,Risk-averse stochastic optimization: probabilistically-constrained models and algorithms for black-box distributions,2011,"We consider various stochastic models that incorporate the notion of risk-averseness into the standard 2-stage recourse model, and develop novel techniques for solving the algorithmic problems arising in these models. A key notable feature of our work that distinguishes it from work in some other related models, such as the (standard) budget model and the (demand-) robust model, is that we obtain results in the  black-box  setting, that is, where one is given  only  sampling access to the underlying distribution. Our first model, which we call the  risk-averse budget model , incorporates the notion of risk-averseness via a  probabilistic constraint  that restricts the probability (according to the underlying distribution) with which the second-stage cost may exceed a given budget  B  to at most a given input threshold ρ. We also a consider a closely-related model that we call the  risk-averse robust model , where we seek to minimize the first-stage cost and the (1 − ρ)- quantile  (according to the distribution) of the second-stage cost.   We obtain approximation algorithms for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems including the set cover, vertex cover, multicut on trees, and facility location problems, in the risk-averse budget and robust models with  black-box distributions . Our main contribution is to devise a  fully polynomial approximation scheme  for solving the  LP-relaxations  of a wide-variety of risk-averse budgeted problems. Complementing this, we give a simple rounding procedure that shows that one can exploit existing LP-based approximation algorithms for the 2-stage-stochastic and/or deterministic counterpart of the problem to round the fractional solution and obtain an approximation algorithm for the risk-averse problem. To the best of our knowledge, these are the  first approximation results  for problems involving  probabilistic constraints and black-box distributions . A notable feature of our scheme is that it extends easily to handle a significantly richer class of risk-averse problems, where we impose a  joint probabilistic budget constraint  on different components of the second-stage cost. Consequently, we also obtain approximation algorithms in the setting where we have a joint budget constraint on different portions of the second-stage cost."
2594337,15514,23684,Tight lower bounds for greedy routing in higher-dimensional small-world grids,2014,"We consider Kleinberg's celebrated small world graph model [12, 13], in which a D-dimensional grid {0, ..., n - 1}D is augmented with a constant number of additional unidirectional edges leaving each node. These long range edges are determined at random according to a probability distribution (the augmenting distribution), which is the same for each node. Kleinberg suggested using the inverse D-th power distribution, in which node v is the long range contact of node u with a probability proportional to ||u - v||1-D. He showed that such an augmenting distribution allows to route a message efficiently in the resulting random graph: The greedy algorithm, where in each intermediate node the message travels over a link that brings the message closest to the target w.r.t. the Manhattan distance, finds a path of expected length O((log n)2) between any two nodes. In this paper we prove that greedy routing does not perform asymptotically better for any uniform and isotropic augmenting distribution, i. e., the probability that node u has a particular long range contact v is independent of the labels of u and v and only a function of ||u - v||1. In particular, we show that for such graphs the expected greedy routing time between two arbitrary nodes s and t is Ω((log ||s - t||1)2). This lower bound proves and strengthens a conjecture by Aspnes, Diamadi, and Shah [1].#R##N##R##N#In order to obtain the result, we introduce a novel proof technique: We define a so-called budget game, in which a token travels over a game board, from one end to the other, while the player manages a probability budget. In each round, the player bets part of her remaining probability budget on step sizes. A step size is chosen at random according to a probability distribution of the player's bet. The token then makes progress as determined by the chosen step size, while some of the player's bet is removed from her probability budget. We prove a tight lower bound for such a budget game, and then obtain a lower bound for greedy routing in the D-dimensional grid by a reduction."
1861189,15514,23735,High-accuracy hand-eye calibration from motion on manifolds,2011,"The hand-eye problem consists in computing the poses between pairs of different coordinate frames fixed to the same rigid body from measurements of such poses as the body moves. Various procedures have been proposed over the past two decades for solving this problem in presence of noise, especially for a robot as the moving body. As a matter of fact, different formulations of the problem in terms of the well known AX=XB or AX=ZB equations implement different flavors of an error minimization procedure, either least-square or non-linear, on the basis of a common algebra. It is shown in this paper that better results in terms of accuracy can be obtained outside the conventional approach. Rather than fitting the calibration matrices out of a number of random poses, the presented method superimposes easily programmable robot poses in order to attain a set of constant manifolds, like points, circles and axes, among the different coordinate frames. Such manifolds are used for identifying the constant relationships between the coordinate frames that are in fact the poses under estimation. The proposed method presents the implementation of a simple robot motion routine for generating the manifolds. Standard mathematical tools are used for fitting the manifolds out of an actual realization of the procedure with tracked markers. The geometry of the proposed manifolds also reduces the propagation of the measurement noise that usually affects the conventional computation based on relative poses. Results are given in simulation and with a real setup in comparison with the most popular state-of-the-art algorithms."
1062639,15514,65,Comparison of trajectory generation methods for a human-robot interface based on motion tracking in the Int 2 Bot,2014,"The acceptance of artificial devices like prostheses or other wearable robots requires their integration into the body schemas of the users. Different factors induce, influence and support the integration and acceptance of the device that substitutes or augments a part of the body. Previous studies have shown that the inducing and maintaining factors are visual, tactile and proprioceptive informations as well as their multi-sensory integration. This paper describes the vision-based part of the human-robot interface in the Int 2 Bot, which is a robot for the investigation of lower limb body schema integration during postural movements. The psychological approach and the technical setup of the robot, which is designed to imitate postural movements in the sagittal plane to imitate the human subject while performing squats, are outlined. To realize the imitation, an RGB-D sensor, in form of a Microsoft Kinect, is used to capture the subjects motions without contact and thereby avoid disturbances of body schema integration. For generation of the desired joint trajectories to be tracked by the control algorithm, different methods like an extended Kalman filter, inverse kinematics, an inverse kinematics algorithm using Jacobian transpose and approaches based on kinematic assumptions are presented, evaluated and compared based on human data. Benchmarking the results with data acquired using a professional motion capturing system shows that best overall joint angle estimations are achieved with the extended Kalman filter. Finally, the practical implementation within the robot is presented and the tracking behavior using the trajectories generated with the extended Kalman filter are analyzed."
2276899,15514,23922,"The More, the Merrier: the Blessing of Dimensionality for Learning Large Gaussian Mixtures",2013,"In this paper we show that very large mixtures of Gaussians are efficiently learnable in high dimension. More precisely, we prove that a mixture with known identical covariance matrices whose number of components is a polynomial of any fixed degree in the dimension n is polynomially learnable as long as a certain non-degeneracy condition on the means is satisfied. It turns out that this condition is generic in the sense of smoothed complexity, as soon as the dimensionality of the space is high enough. Moreover, we prove that no such condition can possibly exist in low dimension and the problem of learning the parameters is generically hard. In contrast, much of the existing work on Gaussian Mixtures relies on low-dimensional projections and thus hits an artificial barrier. Our main result on mixture recovery relies on a new Poissonization-based technique, which transforms a mixture of Gaussians to a linear map of a product distribution. The problem of learning this map can be efficiently solved using some recent results on tensor decompositions and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), thus giving an algorithm for recovering the mixture. In addition, we combine our low-dimensional hardness results for Gaussian mixtures with Poissonization to show how to embed difficult instances of low-dimensional Gaussian mixtures into the ICA setting, thus establishing exponential information-theoretic lower bounds for underdetermined ICA in low dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result in the literature. In addition to contributing to the problem of Gaussian mixture learning, we believe that this work is among the first steps toward better understanding the rare phenomenon of the blessing of dimensionality in the computational aspects of statistical inference."
1495497,15514,23634,On the Hardness of Signaling,2014,"There has been a recent surge of interest in the role of information in strategic interactions. Much of this work seeks to understand how the realized equilibrium of a game is influenced by uncertainty in the environment and the information available to players in the game. Lurking beneath this literature is a fundamental, yet largely unexplored, algorithmic question: how should a market maker who is privy to additional information, and equipped with a specified objective, inform the players in the game? This is an informational analogue of the mechanism design question, and views the information structure of a game as a mathematical object to be designed, rather than an exogenous variable. We initiate a complexity-theoretic examination of the design of optimal information structures in general Bayesian games, a task often referred to as signaling. We focus on one of the simplest instantiations of the signaling question: Bayesian zero-sum games, and a principal who must choose an information structure maximizing the equilibrium payoff of one of the players. In this setting, we show that optimal signaling is computationally intractable, and in some cases hard to approximate, assuming that it is hard to recover a planted clique from an Erdos-Renyi random graph. This is despite the fact that equilibria in these games are computable in polynomial time, and therefore suggests that the hardness of optimal signaling is a distinct phenomenon from the hardness of equilibrium computation. Necessitated by the non-local nature of information structures, en-route to our results we prove an amplification lemma for the planted clique problem which may be of independent interest. Specifically, we show that even if we plant many cliques in an Erdos-Renyi random graph, so much so that most nodes in the graph are in some planted clique, recovering a constant fraction of the planted cliques is no easier than the traditional planted clique problem."
432751,15514,23684,On the optimality of approximation schemes for the classical scheduling problem,2014,"We consider the classical scheduling problem on parallel identical machines to minimize the makespan. There is a long history of studies on this problem, focusing on exact and approximation algorithms, and it is thus natural to consider whether these algorithms are best possible in terms of the running time. Under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), we achieve the following results in this paper:#R##N##R##N#• The scheduling problem on a constant number m of identical machines, which is denoted as Pm||Cmax, is known to admit a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) of running time O(n) + (1/e)O(m) (indeed, the algorithm works for an even more general problem where machines are unrelated). We prove this algorithm is essentially the best possible in the sense that a (1/e)O(m1-δ) + nO(1) time FPTAS for any δ > 0 implies that ETH fails.#R##N##R##N#• The scheduling problem on an arbitrary number of identical machines, which is denoted as P||Cmax, is known to admit a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) of running time 2O(1/e2 log3(1/e))+nO(1). We prove this algorithm is nearly optimal in the sense that a 2O((1/e)1-δ+nO(1) time PTAS for any δ > 0 implies that ETH fails, leaving a small room for improvement.#R##N##R##N#In addition, we also consider exact algorithms for the scheduling problem and prove the following result:#R##N##R##N#• The traditional dynamic programming algorithm for P||Cmax is known to run in 2O(n) time. We prove this is essentially the best possible in the sense that even if we restrict that there are n jobs and the processing time of each job is bounded by O(n), an exact algorithm of running time 22O(n1-δ) for any δ > 0 implies that ETH fails.#R##N##R##N#To obtain these results we will provide two new reductions from 3SAT, one for Pm||Cmax and another for P||Cmax. Indeed, the new reductions explore the structure of scheduling problems and can also lead to other interesting results. For example, using the framework of our reduction for P||Cmax, Chen et al. [5] are able to prove the APX-hardness of the scheduling problem in which the matrix of job processing times P = (pij)mxn is of rank 3, solving the open problem mentioned in [2]."
2388220,15514,23735,Recursive state-parameter estimation of haptic robotic systems,2011,"In this paper, a nonlinear signal-processing scheme is developed for robotic systems that exploits a joint state-parameter formulation for simultaneous recursive estimation of the states (e.g. joint angles and rates) and uncertain parameters (e.g. inertial and friction parameters), out of noisy measurements (e.g. joint angles). Unscented Kalman filtering was employed to overcome restrictions such as linearity in the parameters and the need for availability of joint velocities and accelerations (present in linear recursive least square methods), and the linearization problems associated with extended Kalman filtering. Owing to the unscented transform concept which requires only input-output evaluations of the dynamic model, a more general and modular implementation is realizable. This allows for the utilization of computational modeling tools without the requirement of symbolically manipulating or deriving the equations of motion. Also, the recursive nature of the scheme allows for both offline processing and online implementation. The practical performance of the proposed scheme was verified through an experiment involving a five-bar linkage based haptic device configured to render a virtual box. The torque pair commands generated by the haptic controller to render the virtual box and the encoder angular measurements acquired through the experiment were processed twice in two different input-output directions: once, for state-parameter estimation of the robot; and, another time for identification of supposedly unknown environmental parameters. Results demonstrate successfulness of the scheme for recursive state-parameter estimation of the robot and the environment, as well as promising applicability in online settings."
2116528,15514,23735,The impact of different competence levels of Care-Receiving Robot on children,2011,"A Care-Receiving Robot (CRR) receives care from the people around it. The concept of CRR was first proposed in 2009 [1], [2] by the second author of this paper. This is a novel concept developed in response to the need for continuing to involve human teachers and adult care-givers in raising and nurturing children even as we move on to the next step in technological development and gradually begin to incorporate robots in our daily lives and most importantly in our educational environment. In the past decade, the interest in the development of educational agents has gradually grown to include robots [3]. Educational robots so far have been seen in the teaching role [4], [5], [6]. In contrast, this concept explores the learner role for the robot even though its goal is to teach. The idea behind CRR is inspired by the concept of learning by teaching developed formally in the 1980s [7] and further tested in other works [8]. We have conducted a series of experiments to test the concept of CRR. We have formally launched an investigation into the feasibility, benefits, and requirements for implementing CRR in real classrooms [9]. In this paper, we will report our early findings about the environmental and circumstantial setup for successfully implementing CRR and its impact on students in terms of learning reinforcement. We have set CRR's competence level to two opposite values in the set of experiments we describe in this paper. We present here the comparison data from our analysis of the interaction rate during the two conditions. Our most prominent finding is that children are quite happy to play ‘teacher’ to a weaker student (CRR). The benefit of this opportunity is that it not only boosts the child's self-confidence about the topic, but also reinforces the existing knowledge of the child."
2077710,15514,9969,Cryptography with Streaming Algorithms,2014,"We put forth the question of whether cryptography is fea- sible using streaming devices. We give constructions and prove lower bounds. In streaming cryptography (not to be confused with stream- ciphers) everything—the keys, the messages, and the seeds—are huge compared to the internal memory of the device. These streaming algo- rithms have small internal memory size and make a constant number of passes over big data maintained in a constant number of read/write external tapes. Typically, the internal memory size is O(log n )a nd we use 2 external tapes; whereas 1 tape is provably insufficient. In this set- ting we cannot compute instances of popular intractability assumptions. Nevertheless, we base cryptography on these assumptions by employing non-black-box techniques, and study its limitations. We introduce new techniques to obtain unconditional lower bounds showing that no super-linear stretch pseudorandom generator exists, and no Public Key Encryption (PKE) exists with private-keys of size sub- linear in the plaintext length. For possibility results, assuming the existence of one-way functions computable in NC 1 —e.g. factoring, lattice assumptions—we obtain streaming algorithms computing one-way functions and pseudorandom generators. Given the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption we con- struct PKE where both the encryption and decryption are streaming algorithms. The starting point of our work is the groundbreaking work of Applebaum-Ishai-Kushilevitz on Cryptography in NC 0 . In the end, our developments are technically orthogonal to their work; e.g. there is a PKE where the decryption is a streaming algorithm, whereas no PKE decryption can be in NC 0 ."
1241162,15514,23634,New Extension of the Weil Bound for Character Sums with Applications to Coding,2011,"The Weil bound for character sums is a deep result in Algebraic Geometry with many applications both in mathematics and in the theoretical computer science. The Weil bound states that for any polynomial $f(x)$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ and any additive character $\chi:\mathbb{F} \to \mathbb{C}$, either $\chi(f(x))$ is a constant function or it is distributed close to uniform. The Weil bound is quite effective as long as $\deg(f) \ll \sqrt{|\mathbb{F}|}$, but it breaks down when the degree of $f$ exceeds $\sqrt{|\mathbb{F}|}$. As the Weil bound plays a central role in many areas, finding extensions for polynomials of larger degree is an important problem with many possible applications. In this work we develop such an extension over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ of small characteristic: we prove that if $f(x)=g(x)+h(x)$ where $\deg(g) \ll \sqrt{|\mathbb{F}|}$ and $h(x)$ is a sparse polynomial of arbitrary degree but bounded weight degree, then the same conclusion of the classical Weil bound still holds: either $\chi(f(x))$ is constant or its distribution is close to uniform. In particular, this shows that the sub code of Reed-Muller codes of degree $\omega(1)$ generated by traces of sparse polynomials is a code with near optimal distance, while Reed-Muller of such a degree has no distance (i.e. $o(1)$ distance), this is one of the few examples where one can prove that sparse polynomials behave differently from non-sparse polynomials of the same degree. As an application we prove new general results for affine invariant codes. We prove that any affine-invariant subspace of quasi-polynomial size is (1) indeed a code (i.e. has good distance) and (2) is locally testable. Previous results for general affine invariant codes were known only for codes of polynomial size, and of length $2^n$ where $n$ needed to be a prime. Thus, our techniques are the first to extend to general families of such codes of super-polynomial size, where we also remove the requirement from $n$ to be a prime. The proof is based on two main ingredients: the extension of the Weil bound for character sums, and a new Fourier-analytic approach for estimating the weight distribution of general codes with large dual distance, which may be of independent interest."
2590259,15514,23684,Submodular maximization with cardinality constraints,2014,"We consider the problem of maximizing a (non-monotone) submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint. In addition to capturing well-known combinatorial optimization problems, e.g., Max-k-Coverage and Max-Bisection, this problem has applications in other more practical settings such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. In this work we present improved approximations for two variants of the cardinality constraint for non-monotone functions. When at most k elements can be chosen, we improve the current best 1/e -- o(1) approximation to a factor that is in the range [1/e + 0.004, 1/2], achieving a tight approximation of 1/2 -- o(1) for k = n/2 and breaking the 1/e barrier for all values of k. When exactly k elements must be chosen, our algorithms improve the current best 1/4 -- o(1) approximation to a factor that is in the range [0.356, 1/2], again achieving a tight approximation of 1/2 -- o(1) for k = n/2. Additionally, some of the algorithms we provide are very fast with time complexities of O(nk), as opposed to previous known algorithms which are continuous in nature, and thus, too slow for applications in the practical settings mentioned above.#R##N##R##N#Our algorithms are based on two new techniques. First, we present a simple randomized greedy approach where in each step a random element is chosen from a set of reasonably good elements. This approach might be considered a natural substitute for the greedy algorithm of Nemhauser, Wolsey and Fisher [45], as it retains the same tight guarantee of 1--1/e for monotone objectives and the same time complexity of O(nk), while giving an approximation of 1/e for general non-monotone objectives (while the greedy algorithm of Nemhauser et. al. fails to provide any constant guarantee). Second, we extend the double greedy technique, which achieves a tight 1/2 approximation for unconstrained submodular maximization, to the continuous setting. This allows us to manipulate the natural rates by which elements change, thus bounding the total number of elements chosen."
2193654,15514,23684,New constructions of RIP matrices with fast multiplication and fewer rows,2014,"In this paper, we present novel constructions of matrices with the restricted isometry property (RIP) that support fast matrix-vector multiplication. Our guarantees are the best known, and can also be used to obtain the best known guarantees for fast Johnson Lindenstrauss transforms.#R##N##R##N#In compressed sensing, the restricted isometry property is a sufficient condition for the efficient reconstruction of a nearly k-sparse vector x e Cd from m linear measurements Φx. It is desirable for m to be small, and further it is desirable for Φ to support fast matrix-vector multiplication. Among other applications, fast multiplication improves the runtime of iterative recovery algorithms which repeatedly multiply by Φ or Φ*.#R##N##R##N#The main contribution of this work is a novel randomized construction of RIP matrices Φ e Cmxd, preserving the e2 norms of all k-sparse vectors with distortion 1 + e, where the matrix-vector multiply Φx can be computed in nearly linear time. The number of rows m is on the order of e-2k log dlog2(kl oge d), an improvement on previous analyses by a logarithmic factor. Our construction, together with a connection between RIP matrices and the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma in [Krahmer-Ward, SIAM. J. Math. Anal. 2011], also implies fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings with asymptotically fewer rows than previously known.#R##N##R##N#Our construction is actually a recipe for improving any existing family of RIP matrices. Briefly, we apply an appropriate sparse hash matrix with sign flips to any suitable family of RIP matrices. We show that the embedding properties of the original family are maintained, while at the same time improving the number of rows. The main tool in our analysis is a recent bound for the supremum of certain types of Rademacher chaos processes in [Krahmer-Mendelson-Rauhut, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. to appear]."
910833,15514,208,Resource Allocation with Non-deterministic Demands and Profits,2013,"Support for intelligent and autonomous resource management is one key factor to the success of modern sensor network systems. The limited resources, such as exhaustible battery life, moderate processing ability and finite bandwidth, restrict the system's ability to serve multiple users simultaneously. It always happens that only a subset of tasks is selected with the goal of maximizing total profit. Besides, because of uncertain factors like unreliable wireless medium or variable quality of sensor outputs, it is not practical to assume that both demands and profits of tasks are deterministic and known a priori, both of which may be stochastic following certain distributions. In this paper, we model this resource allocation challenge as a stochastic knapsack problem. We study a specific case in which both demands and profits follow normal distributions, which are then extended to Poisson and Binomial variables. A couple of tunable parameters are introduced to configure two probabilities: one limits the capacity overflow rate with which the combined demand is allowed to exceed the available supply, and the other sets the minimum chance at which expected profit is required to be achieved. We define relative values for random variables in given conditions, and utilize them to search for the best resource allocation solutions. We propose heuristics with different optimality/efficiency tradeoffs, and find that our algorithms run relatively fast and provide results considerably close to the optimum."
1625183,15514,8228,Memory consumption analysis for the GOE and PET Unequal Erasure Protection schemes,2012,"Unequal Erasure Protection (UEP) is an attractive approach to protect data flows that contain information of different priority levels. The various solutions that have been proposed can be classified into three families. The first one consists of specific, UEP-aware FEC codes, that map the information dependency within the code structure. It enables to design a specific solution, valid for a specific data flow, as in [3]. However, because this is a specific solution, its practical interest is also narrowed. In this work we focus on two additional solution families. One family implements UEP thanks to a dedicated packetization scheme, as it is the case with Priority Encoding Transmission (PET) [2], while the other family uses a dedicated signaling scheme, as is the case with the Generalized Object Encoding (GOE) [6]. These two solutions have the main benefit of being compatible with existing standardized Application Layer FEC (AL-FEC) schemes, which is a major practical benefit. Through a careful modeling of both proposals, we have demonstrated that the protection performance of both approaches are equivalent [7]. However additional key differences become apparent when considering such a practical metric as the peak memory consumption. Thanks to a modeling of the packet storage behavior at the receiver side, and by considering two major parameters, namely the channel loss probability and the permutation type, we show that the GOE scheme (without interleaver) requires a smaller memory storage than PET. This result is reversed if GOE uses a uniform interleaver."
659042,15514,23684,Bidimensionality and geometric graphs,2012,"Bidimensionality theory was introduced by Demaine et al. [JACM 2005] as a framework to obtain algorithmic results for hard problems on minor closed graph classes. The theory has been successfully applied to yield subex-ponential time parameterized algorithms, EPTASs and linear kernels for many problems on families of graphs excluding a fixed graph H as a minor. In this paper we use several of the key ideas from Bidimensionality to give a new generic approach to design EPTASs and subexponential time parameterized algorithms for problems on classes of graphs which are not minor closed, but instead exhibit a geometric structure. In particular we present EPTASs and subexponential time parameterized algorithms for Feedback Vertex Set, Vertex Cover, Connected Vertex Cover, on map graphs and unit disk graphs, PTASs for Diamond Hitting Set on map graphs and unit disk graphs, and a PTAS and a subexponential time algorithm for Cycle Packing on unit disk graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these results were previously unknown, with the exception of the EPTAS and a subexponential time parameterized algorithm on unit disk graphs for Vertex Cover, which were obtained by Marx [ESA 2005] and Alber and Fiala [J. Algorithms 2004], respectively.#R##N##R##N#Our results are based on the recent decomposition theorems proved by Fomin et al. in [SODA 2011] and novel grid-excluding theorems in unit disk and map graphs without large cliques. Our algorithms work directly on the input graph and do not require the geometric representations of the input graph. We also show that our approach can not be extended in its full generality to more general classes of geometric graphs, such as intersection graphs of unit balls in Rd, d ≥ 3. Specifically, we prove that Feedback Vertex Set on unit-ball graphs in R3 neither admits PTASs unless P=NP, nor subexponential time algorithms unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails. Additionally, we show that the decomposition theorems which our approach is based on, fail for disk graphs and that therefore any extension of our results to disk graphs would require new algorithmic ideas. On the other hand, we prove that our EPTASs and subexponential time algorithms for Vertex Cover and Connected Vertex Cover carry over both to disk graphs and to unit-ball graphs in Rd for every fixed d."
989608,15514,23634,Approximating the Expansion Profile and Almost Optimal Local Graph Clustering,2012,"Spectral partitioning is a simple, nearly-linear time, algorithm to find sparse cuts, and the Cheeger inequalities provide a worst-case guarantee of the quality of the approximation found by the algorithm. Local graph partitioning algorithms [ST08, ACL06, AP09] run in time that is nearly linear in the size of the output set, and their approximation guarantee is worse than the guarantee provided by the Cheeger inequalities by a poly-logarithmic $\log^{\Omega(1)} n$ factor. It has been an open problem to design a local graph clustering algorithm with an approximation guarantee close to the guarantee of the Cheeger inequalities and with a running time nearly linear in the size of the output. In this paper we solve this problem, we design an algorithm with the same guarantee (up to a constant factor) as the Cheeger inequality, that runs in time slightly super linear in the size of the output. This is the first sub linear (in the size of the input) time algorithm with almost the same guarantee as the Cheeger's inequality. As a byproduct of our results, we prove a bicriteria approximation algorithm for the expansion profile of any graph. Let $\mu(S)=\sum_{v\in S} d(v)$ be the volume, and $\phi(S):=|E(S, \over line{S})|/\mu(S)$, be the conductance of a set $S$ of vertices. If there is a set of volume at most $\gamma$ and conductance $\phi$, we can find a set of volume at most $\gamma^{1+\eps}$ and conductance at most $O( \sqrt{\phi/\eps} )$, for any $\eps>0$. Our proof techniques also provide a simpler proof of the structural result of Arora, Barak, Steurer [ABS10], that can be applied to irregular graphs. Our main technical tool is a lemma stating that, for any set $S$ of vertices of a graph, a lazy $t$-step random walk started from a randomly chosen vertex of $S$, will remain entirely inside $S$ with probability at least $(1-\phi(S)/2)^t$. The lemma also implies a new lower bound to the uniform mixing time of any finite states reversible markov chain."
385981,15514,23684,On multiplicative λ-approximations and some geometric applications,2012,"Let F be a set system over an underlying finite set X, and let μ be a nonnegative measure over X. I.e., for every S ⊆ X, μ(S) = ΣxeS μ(x). A measure μ* on X is called a multiplicative λ-approximation of μ on (F, X) if for every S e F it holds that aμ(S) ≤ μ* (S) ≤ bμ(S), and b/a = λ ≥ 1. The central question raised and partially answered in the present paper is about the existence of meaningful structural properties of F implying that for any μ on X there exists an 1+e/1-e-approximation μ* supported on a small subset of X.#R##N##R##N#It turns out that the parameter that governs the support size of a multiplicative approximation is the triangular rank of F, trk(F). It is defined as the maximal length of a sequence of sets {Si}ti=1 in F such that for all 1 < i ≤ t, Si n ∪j<i Sj. We show that for any μ on X and 0 < e < 1, there is measure μ* that 1+e/1-e-approximates μ on (X, F), and has support of size O(trk(F)2log(trk(F))/poly(e)). We also present two alternative constructions which in some cases improve upon this bound. Conversely, we show that for any 0 ≤ e < 1 there exists a μ on X that cannot be 1+e/1-e-approximated on (F, X) by any μ* with support of size < trk(F). For special families F this bound can be improved to Ω(trk(F)/e).#R##N##R##N#As an application we show a new dimension-reduction result for l1 metrics: Any l1-metric on n points can be (efficiently) embedded with 1+e/1-e-distortion into RO(n/e2 equipped with the l1 norm. This improves over the best previously known bound of O(n log n/poly(e)) on dimension, due to Schechtman.#R##N##R##N#We obtain also some new results on efficient sampling of Euclidean volumes. In order to make the general framework applicable to this setting, we develop the basic theory of finite volumes, analogous to the theory of finite metrics, and get results of independent interest in this direction. To do so, we use basic combinatorial/topological facts about simplicial complexes, and study the naturally arising questions."
1388192,15514,23735,Underwater object tracking using electrical impedance tomography,2012,"Few effective technologies exist for sensing in dark or murky underwater situations. For this reason, we have been exploring the use of a novel biologically-inspired approach to non-visual sensing based on the detection of perturbations to a self generated electric field. This is used by many species of neotropical nocturnal freshwater fish. This approach, termed active electrosense, presents unique challenges for sensing and tracking of nearby objects. We explore two methods for estimating the velocity of objects through active electrosense. The first of these methods uses a simple cross-correlation method, which depends on the uniformity of the electric field. We show some of the ramifications of making this assumption for a self-generated field around a cylindrical pod-shaped sensor in a rectangular tank. We then evaluate the use of methods developed for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for localization and tracking. This is an unusual application of EIT in that typical applications involve surrounding the volume of interest (such as the thorax of humans) with sensor/emitters. Here, rather than this “outside in” approach, we are using EIT “inside out.” In simulation, we nonetheless find significant improvements in the accuracy of estimated velocity when using the EIT approach. Additionally, we demonstrate how EIT may be used for accurate position estimation. Under the conditions evaluated, the computation time for inversion is low enough to make its use feasible as a primary position and velocity estimator in an on- line system or as a secondary system to augment a computationally inexpensive estimator."
1027535,15514,23735,A two party haptic guidance controller via a hard rein,2013,"In the case of human intervention in disaster response operations like indoor firefighting, where the environment perception is limited due to thick smoke, noise in the oxygen masks and clutter, not only limit the environmental perception of the human responders, but also causes distress. An intelligent agent (man/machine) with full environment perceptual capabilities is an alternative to enhance navigation in such unfavorable environments. Since haptic communication is the least affected mode of communication in such cases, we consider human demonstrations to use a hard rein to guide blindfolded followers with auditory distraction to be a good paradigm to extract salient features of guiding using hard reins. Based on numerical simulations and experimental systems identification based on demonstrations from eight pairs of human subjects, we show that, the relationship between the orientation difference between the follower and the guider, and the lateral swing patterns of the hard rein by the guider can be explained by a novel 3 rd  order auto regressive predictive controller. Moreover, by modeling the two party voluntary movement dynamics using a virtual damped inertial model, we were able to model the mutual trust between two parties. In the future, the novel controller extracted based on human demonstrations can be tested on a human-robot interaction scenario to guide a visually impaired person in various applications like fire fighting, search and rescue, medical surgery, etc."
1546480,15514,23735,Uncalibrated 3D stereo image-based dynamic visual servoing for robot manipulators,2013,"This paper introduces a new comprehensive solution for the open problem of uncalibrated 3D image-based stereo visual servoing for robot manipulators. One of the main contributions of this article is a novel 3D stereo camera model to map positions in the task space to positions in a new 3D Visual Cartesian Space (a visual feature space where 3D positions are measured in pixel). This model is used to compute a full-rank Image Jacobian Matrix (J img ), which solves several common problems presented on the classical image Jacobians, e.g., image space singularities and local minima. This Jacobian is a fundamental key for the image-based control design, where uncalibrated stereo camera systems can be used to drive a robot manipulator. Furthermore, an adaptive second order sliding mode visual servo control is designed to track 3D visual motions using the 3D trajectory errors defined in the Visual Cartesian Space. The stability of the control in closed loop with a dynamic robot system is formally analyzed and proved, where exponential convergence of errors in the Visual Cartesian Space and task space without local minima are demonstrated. The complete control system is evaluated both in simulation and on a real industrial robot. The robustness of the control scheme is evaluated for cases where the extrinsic parameters of the stereo camera system change on-line and the kinematic/dynamic robot parameters are considered as unknown. This approach offers a proper solution for the common problem of visual occlusion, since the stereo system can be moved to obtain a clear view of the task at any time."
1461108,15514,23634,Beck's Three Permutations Conjecture: A Counterexample and Some Consequences,2012,"Given three permutations on the integers 1 through $n$, consider the set system consisting of each interval in each of the three permutations. In 1982, Beck conjectured that the discrepancy of this set system is $O(1)$. In other words, the conjecture says that each integer from 1 through $n$ can be colored either red or blue so that the number of red and blue integers in each interval of each permutations differs only by a constant. (The discrepancy of a set system based on two permutations is at most two.) Our main result is a counterexample to this conjecture: for any positive integer $n = 3^k$, we construct three permutations whose corresponding set system has discrepancy $\Omega(\log{n})$. Our counterexample is based on a simple recursive construction, and our proof of the discrepancy lower bound is by induction. This construction also disproves a generalization of Beck's conjecture due to Spencer, Srinivasan and Tetali, who conjectured that a set system corresponding to $\ell$ permutations has discrepancy $O(\sqrt{\ell})$. Our work was inspired by an intriguing paper from SODA 2011 by Eisenbrand, P{\'a}lv{\o}lgyi and Rothvo\ss, who show a surprising connection between the discrepancy of three permutations and the bin packing problem: They show that Beck's conjecture implies a constant worst-case bound on the additive integrality gap for the Gilmore-Gomory LP relaxation for bin packing in the special case when all items have sizes strictly between $1/4$ and $1/2$, also known as the three partition problem. Our counterexample shows that this approach to bounding the additive integrality gap for bin packing will not work. We can, however, prove an interesting implication of our construction in the reverse direction: there are instances of bin packing and corresponding optimal basic feasible solutions for the Gilmore-Gomory LP relaxation such that any packing that contains only patterns from the support of these solutions requires at least ${\rm opt} + \Omega(\log{m})$ bins, where $m$ is the number of items. Finally, we discuss some implications that our construction has for other areas of discrepancy theory."
2704875,15514,23735,Group induction,2013,"Machine perception often requires a large amount of user-annotated data which is time-consuming, difficult, or expensive to collect. Perception systems should be easy to train by regular users, and this is currently far from the case. Our previous work, tracking-based semi-supervised learning [14], helped reduce the labeling burden by using tracking information to harvest new and useful training examples. However, [14] was designed for offline use; it assumed a fixed amount of unlabeled data and did not allow for corrections from users. In many practical robot perception scenarios we A) desire continuous learning over a long period of time, B) have a stream of unlabeled sensor data available rather than a fixed dataset, and C) are willing to periodically provide a small number of new training examples. In light of this, we present group induction, a new mathematical framework that rigorously encodes the intuition of [14] in an alternating optimization problem similar to expectation maximization (EM), but with the assumption that the unlabeled data comes in groups of instances that share the same hidden label. The mathematics suggest several improvements to the original heuristic algorithm, and make clear how to handle user interaction and streams of unlabeled data. We evaluate group induction on a track classification task from natural street scenes, demonstrating its ability to learn continuously, adapt to user feedback, and accurately recognize objects of interest."
1326340,15514,23634,On the AC0 Complexity of Subgraph Isomorphism,2014,"Let P be a fixed graph (hereafter called a pattern), and let Subgraph(P) denote the problem of deciding whether a given graph G contains a subgraph isomorphic to P. We are interested in AC0-complexity of this problem, determined by the smallest possible exponent C(P) for which Subgraph(P) possesses bounded-depth circuits of size nC(P)+o(1). Motivated by the previous research in the area, we also consider its colorful version Subgraphcol(P) in which the target graph G is V(P)-colored, and the average-case version Subgraphave(P) under the distribution G(n, n-?(P)), where ?(P) is the threshold exponent of P. Defining Ccol(P) and Cave(P) analogously to C(P), our main contributions can be summarized as follows. Ccol(P) coincides with the tree-width of the pattern P within a logarithmic factor. This shows that the previously known upper bound by Alon, Yuster, Zwick [3] is almost tight. We give a characterization of Cave(P) in purely combinatorial terms within a multiplicative factor of 2. This shows that the lower bound technique of Rossman [21] is essentially tight, for any pattern P whatsoever. We prove that if Q is a minor of P then Subgraphcol(Q) is reducible to Subgraphcol(P) via a linear-size monotone projection. At the same time, we show that there is no monotone projection whatsoever that reduces Subgraph(M3) to Subgraph(P3 + M2) (P3 is a path on 3 vertices, Mk is a matching with k edges, and + stands for the disjoint union). This result strongly suggests that the colorful version of the subgraph isomorphism problem is much better structured and well-behaved than the standard (worst-case, uncolored) one."
761824,15514,23735,A pipeline for structured light bathymetric mapping,2012,"This paper details a methodology for using structured light laser imaging to create high resolution bathymetric maps of the sea floor. The system includes a pair of stereo cameras and an inclined 532nm sheet laser mounted to a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). While a structured light system generally requires a single camera, a stereo vision set up is used here for in-situ calibration of the laser system geometry by triangulating points on the laser line. This allows for quick calibration at the survey site and does not require precise jigs or a controlled environment. A batch procedure to extract the laser line from the images to sub-pixel accuracy is also presented. The method is robust to variations in image quality and moderate amounts of water column turbidity. The final maps are constructed using a reformulation of a previous bathymetric Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm called incremental Smoothing and Mapping (iSAM). The iSAM framework is adapted from previous applications to perform sub-mapping, where segments of previously visited terrain are registered to create relative pose constraints. The resulting maps can be gridded at one centimeter and have significantly higher sample density than similar surveys using high frequency multibeam sonar or stereo vision. Results are presented for sample surveys at a submerged archaeological site and sea floor rock outcrop."
2693608,15514,23684,Improved bounds and algorithms for graph cuts and network reliability,2014,"Karger (SIAM Journal on Computing, 1999) developed the first fully-polynomial approximation scheme to estimate the probability that a graph G becomes disconnected, given that its edges are removed independently with probability p. This algorithm runs in O(n5+o(1)e-3) time to obtain an estimate within relative error e.#R##N##R##N#We improve this runtime in two key ways, one algorithmic and one graph-theoretic. From an algorithmic point of view, there is a certain key sub-problem encountered by Karger, for which a generic estimation procedure is employed. We show that this sub-problem has a special structure for which a much more efficient algorithm can be used. From a graph-theoretic point of view, we show better bounds on the number of edge cuts which are likely to fail. Karger's analysis depends on bounds for various graph parameters; we show that these bounds cannot be simultaneously tight. We describe a new graph parameter, which simultaneously influences all the bounds used by Karger, and use it to obtain much tighter estimates of the behavior of the cuts of G. These techniques allow us to improve the runtime to n3+o(1)e-2, which is essentially best-possible for the meta-approach proposed by Karger; our results also rigorously prove certain experimental observations of Karger & Tai (Proc. ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 1997). A key driver of Karger's approach (and other cut-related results) is his earlier bound on the number of small cuts: we also show how to improve this when the min-cut size is small and odd, augmenting, in part, a result of Bixby (Bull. AMS, 1974)."
1090791,15514,23735,From Template to Anchor: A Novel Control Strategy for Spring- Mass Running of Bipedal Robots*,2014,"In this paper, we present a novel control strategy for running of bipedal robots with compliant legs. To achieve this goal and to take advantage of the characteristics of the template, we match the dynamics of the full multibody model of a real biped robot with the dynamics of a well-known running template called spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model. This can be viewed as a template and anchor approach. Because the SLIP model is theoretically conservative, it always operates at a constant energy level. However, real robots operate at various energy levels due to the positive and/or negative work done by the motors, inherent damping/friction of the components and more importantly, the regular ground impact that occurs during the running process. As a case study the proposed controller was implemented on a simulation of the bipedal robot called ATRIAS. The full dynamic equations for running of the ATRIAS robot are derived using the Lagrangian approach. To make our multibody biped robot run with a steady and stable gait that tracks the SLIP model dynamics, a two-level controller is proposed. The upper level controller in stance phase is designed with feedback linearization to make the active SLIP model follow the SLIP model trajectory. The lower level controller in stance phase is designed for the multibody model to track the toe force profile of the active SLIP model. Two active SLIP architectures are proposed for locked and unlocked torso cases of the robot. Simulation results demonstrate stable running based on this strategy for both cases of the ATRIAS model with locked and unlocked torso angle. Matching the SLIP dynamics on running biped robots not designed for spring-mass gaits is impossible due to actuator limitations, or, at best, inefficient."
402579,15514,23684,Improved concentration bounds for count-sketch,2014,"We present a refined analysis of the classic Count-Sketch streaming heavy hitters algorithm [CCF02]. Count-Sketch uses O(k log n) linear measurements of a vector x e Rn to give an estimate x of x. The standard analysis shows that this estimate x satisfies Vx-xV2/∞, where x[k] is the vector containing all but the largest k coordinates of x. Our main result is that most of the coordinates of x have substantially less error than this upper bound; namely for any c < O(log n), we show that each coordinate i satisfies#R##N##R##N#[EQUATION]#R##N##R##N#with probability 1--2-Ω(c), as long as the hash functions are fully independent. This subsumes the previous bound and is optimal for all c. Using these improved point estimates, we prove a stronger concentration result for set estimates by first analyzing the covariance matrix and then using a median-of-median-of-medians argument to bootstrap the failure probability bounds. These results also give improved results for e2 recovery of exactly k-sparse estimates x* when x is drawn from a distribution with suitable decay such as a power law or lognormal.#R##N##R##N#We complement our results with simulations of Count-Sketch on a power law distribution. The empirical evidence indicates that our theoretical bounds give a precise characterization of the algorithm's performance: the asymptotics are correct and the associated constants are small.#R##N##R##N#Our proof shows that any symmetric random variable with finite variance and positive Fourier transform concentrates around 0 at least as well as a Gaussian. This result, which may be of independent interest, gives good concentration even when the noise does not converge to a Gaussian."
1070000,15514,23735,Using haptics to extract object shape from rotational manipulations,2014,"Increasingly widespread available haptic sensors mounted on articulated hands offer new sensory channels that can complement shape extraction from vision to enable a more robust handling of objects in cases when vision is restricted or even unavailable. However, to estimate object shape from haptic interaction data is a difficult challenge due to the complexity of the contact interaction between the movable object and sensor surfaces, leading to a coupled estimation problem of shape and object pose. While for vision efficient solutions to the underlying SLAM problem are known, the available information is much sparser in the tactile case, posing great difficulties for a straightforward adoption of standard SLAM algorithms. In the present paper, we thus explore whether a biologically inspired model based on dynamic neural fields can offer a route towards a practical algorithm for tactile SLAM. Our study is focused on a restricted scenario where a two-fingered robot hand manipulates an n-gon with a fixed rotational axis. We demonstrate that our model can accumulate shape information from reasonably short interaction sequences and autonomously build a representation despite significant ambiguity of the tactile data due to the rotational periodicity of the object. We conclude that the presented framework may be a suitable basis to solve the tactile SLAM problem also in more general settings which will be the focus of subsequent work. I. INTRODUCTION"
2243757,15514,23735,Switchblade: An agile treaded rover,2011,"A versatile unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) should be able to traverse rough terrain while retaining a small form factor for navigating confined spaces. Such a (patent pending) vehicle, dubbed Switchblade, is developed in the present work via an effective combination of a novel transforming mechanical design, capable onboard electronics, and advanced feedback control algorithms. A single chassis holds the actuators, sensors, electronics, and battery. Shafts protruding from either side of this chassis connect to tread assemblies. Rotation of this shaft causes the treads to advance for translational movement; rotation about this shaft causes the entire tread assembly to rotate with respect to the chassis. Vehicle orientation is estimated via onboard filtering of optical encoders and MEMS accelerometers and gyros. In its horizontal configuration, Switchblade operates as a differential-drive treaded platform. In its various upright configurations, Switchblade operates as a mobile inverted pendulum, capable of surmounting obstacles, including stairs, that would otherwise be impassable by a vehicle of its size. Design-for-manufacturing (DFM) and design-for-assembly (DFA) techniques are employed to reduce cost, part count, complexity, and assembly time without sacrificing system capabilities. Results from a working prototype are discussed. The resulting platform is well suited for a variety of socially-relevant applications, including reconnaissance, mine exploration, and search & rescue."
1904076,15514,369,Compressive Sensing with Sparse Measurement Matrices,2011,"This paper discusses compressive sensing with sparse measurement matrices. Sparse matrices have several attractive properties, like low computational complexity in both encoding and recovery, easy incremental updates to signals, and low storage requirement, etc. Typical examples of existing algorithms for sparse signal recovery with sparse measurement matrices include convex relaxation, matching pursuit, and Bayesian framework based approaches. In this paper, we propose an alternative technique to this problem. The proposed technique has a linear recovery complexity and relatively good empirical behavior. In this technique, we employ a permutation-based multi-dimensional measurement matrix, which is composed of several sub-matrices, each consisting of a block-diagonal matrix and a random permutation matrix. The measurement symbols generated from the same permutation matrix are referred to as a dimension. Such a measurement matrix brings some useful features to the measurement symbols. Fully exploiting these features enables us to design a simple and effective recovery algorithm. The proposed recovery algorithm employs an iterative process. In each iteration, the algorithm looks for measurement symbols with certain features, and uses such features to recover the source symbols related to these measurements. An iterative process is then applied, along with an interference cancellation operation, to reconstruct all source symbols gradually. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is relatively low, which grows linearly with the source signal length. Numerical results show that the proposed technique empirically offers a much lower sketch length than l1-minimization-based convex relaxation and Bayesian framework based algorithms. It achieves the empirical lower bound of sketch length and linear recovery complexity at the same time."
569040,15514,20358,Spectral analysis of communication networks using Dirichlet eigenvalues,2013,"Good clustering can provide critical insight into potential locations where congestion in a network may occur. A natural measure of congestion for a collection of nodes in a graph is its Cheeger ratio, defined as the ratio of the size of its boundary to its volume. Spectral methods provide effective means to estimate the smallest Cheeger ratio via the spectral gap of the graph Laplacian. Here, we compute the spectral gap of the truncated graph Laplacian, with the so-called Dirichlet boundary condition, for the graphs of a dozen communication networks at the IP-layer, which are subgraphs of the much larger global IP-layer network. We show that i) the Dirichlet spectral gap of these networks is substantially larger than the standard spectral gap and is therefore a better indicator of the true expansion properties of the graph, ii) unlike the standard spectral gap, the Dirichlet spectral gaps of progressively larger subgraphs converge to that of the global network, thus allowing properties of the global network to be efficiently obtained from them, and (iii) the (first two) eigenvectors of the Dirichlet graph Laplacian can be used for spectral clustering with arguably better results than standard spectral clustering. We first demonstrate these results analytically for finite regular trees. We then perform spectral clustering on the IP-layer networks using Dirichlet eigenvectors and show that it yields cuts near the network core, thus creating genuine single-component clusters. This is much better than traditional spectral clustering where several disjoint fragments near the network periphery are liable to be misleadingly classified as a single cluster. Since congestion in communication networks is known to peak at the core due to large-scale curvature and geometry, identification of core congestion and its localization are important steps in analysis and improved engineering of networks. Thus, spectral clustering with Dirichlet boundary condition is seen to be more effective at finding bona-fide bottlenecks and congestion than standard spectral clustering."
1201745,15514,65,Upper extremity assist exoskeleton robot,2014,"Need to develop human body's posture supervised robots, gave the push to researchers to think over dexterous design of exoskeleton robots. It requires to develop quantitative techniques to assess motor function and generate the command for the robots to act accordingly with complex human structure. In this paper, we focus on developing new technique for the upper limb power exoskeleton in which load is handled by the human subject and not by the robot. Main challenge along with the design complexity is to find the desired human motion intention and to develop an algorithm to assist as needed accordingly. For this purpose, we used newly developed Muscle Circumference Sensor (MCS) instead of electromyogram (EMG) sensors. MCS together with the load cells is used to estimate the desired human intention by which desired trajectory is generated. The desired trajectory is then tracked by passivity based adaptive control technique. Developed Upper limb power exoskeleton has seven degrees of freedom (DOF) in which five are passive and two are active. Active joints include shoulder and elbow, powered by electric motors and move in Sagittal plane while abduction and adduction motion in shoulder joint is provided by the passive joint. Performance of the exoskeleton is evaluated experimentally by a neurologically intact subject. The results show that after adjusting the motion intention recognition algorithm for the subject, the robot assisted effectively and the subject only felt nominal load regardless of the weight in hand."
1861510,15514,8306,Quantum rotations: a case study in static and dynamic machine-code generation for quantum computers,2013,"Work in quantum computer architecture has focused on communication, layout and fault tolerance, largely driven by Shor's factorization algorithm. For the first time, we study a larger range of benchmarks and find that another critical issue is the generation of code sequences for quantum rotation operations. Specifically, quantum algorithms require arbitrary rotation angles, while quantum technologies and error correction codes provide only for discrete angles and operators. A sequence of quantum machine instructions must be generated to approximate the arbitrary rotation to the required precision.   While previous work has focused exclusively on static compilation, we find that some applications require dynamic code generation and explore the advantages and disadvantages of static and dynamic approaches. We find that static code generation can, in some cases, lead to a terabyte of machine code to support required rotations. We also find that some rotation angles are unknown until run time, requiring dynamic code generation. Dynamic code generation, however, exhibits significant trade-offs in terms of time overhead versus code size. Furthermore, dynamic code generation will be performed on classical (non-quantum) computing resources, which may or may not have a clock speed advantage over the target quantum technology. For example, operations on trapped ions run at kilohertz speeds, but superconducting qubits run at gigahertz speeds.   We introduce a new method for compiling arbitrary rotations dynamically, designed to minimize compilation time. The new method reduces compilation time by up to five orders of magnitude while increasing code size by one order of magnitude.   We explore the design space formed by these trade-offs of dynamic versus static code generation, code quality, and quantum technology. We introduce several techniques to provide smoother trade-offs for dynamic code generation and evaluate the viability of options in the design space."
1519446,15514,23634,"Fourier Sparsity, Spectral Norm, and the Log-Rank Conjecture",2013,"We study Boolean functions with sparse Fourier spectrum or small spectral norm, and show their applications to the Log-rank Conjecture for XOR functions f(x ⊕ y) - a fairly large class of functions including well studied ones such as Equality and Hamming Distance. The rank of the communication matrix M f  for such functions is exactly the Fourier sparsity of f. Let d = deg 2 (f) be the F 2 -degree of f and DCC(f · ⊕) stand for the deterministic communication complexity for f(x ⊕ y). We show that 1) DCC(f · ⊕) = O(2 d2/2  log d- 2 ∥f̂∥ 1 ). In particular, the Log-rank conjecture holds for XOR functions with constant F 2 -degree. 2) D CC (f · ⊕) = O(d∥f̂∥ 1 ) = O(√(rank(M f ))). This improves the (trivial) linear bound by nearly a quadratic factor. We obtain our results through a degree-reduction protocol based on a variant of polynomial rank, and actually conjecture that the communication cost of our protocol is at most log O(1)  rank(M f ). The above bounds are obtained from different analysis for the number of parity queries required to reduce f's F 2 -degree. Our bounds also hold for the parity decision tree complexity of f, a measure that is no less than the communication complexity. Along the way we also prove several structural results about Boolean functions with small Fourier sparsity ∥f̂∥ 0  or spectral norm ∥f̂∥ 1 , which could be of independent interest. For functions f with constant F 2 -degree, we show that: 1) f can be written as the summation of quasi-polynomially many indicator functions of subspaces with ±-signs, improving the previous doubly exponential upper bound by Green and Sanders; 2) being sparse in Fourier domain is polynomially equivalent to having a small parity decision tree complexity; and 3) f depends only on polylog∥f̂∥ 1  linear functions of input variables. For functions f with small spectral norm, we show that: 1) there is an affine subspace of co dimension ∥f̂∥ 1  on which f(x) is a constant, and 2) there is a parity decision ∥f̂∥ 1 log∥f̂∥ 0  for computing f."
2094791,15514,23735,Contact-based navigation for an autonomous flying robot,2013,"Autonomous navigation in obstacle-dense indoor environments is very challenging for flying robots due to the high risk of collisions, which may lead to mechanical damage of the platform and eventual failure of the mission. While conventional approaches in autonomous navigation favor obstacle avoidance strategies, recent work showed that collision-robust flying robots could hit obstacles without breaking and even self-recover after a crash to the ground. This approach is particularly interesting for autonomous navigation in complex environments where collisions are unavoidable, or for reducing the sensing and control complexity involved in obstacle avoidance. This paper aims at showing that collision-robust platforms can go a step further and exploit contacts with the environment to achieve useful navigation tasks based on the sense of touch. This approach is typically useful when weight restrictions prevent the use of heavier sensors, or as a low-level detection mechanism supplementing other sensing modalities. In this paper, a solution based on force and inertial sensors used to detect obstacles all around the robot is presented. Eight miniature force sensors, weighting 0.9g each, are integrated in the structure of a collision-robust flying platform without affecting its robustness. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates the use of contact sensing for exploring autonomously a room in 3D, showing significant advantages compared to a previous strategy. To our knowledge this is the first fully autonomous flying robot using touch sensors as only exteroceptive sensors."
862430,15514,65,Human gesture segmentation based on change point model for efficient gesture interface,2013,"Interacting naturally with artificial agents and environments including virtual avatars and robots rely mainly on gestures. However, the later require heavy setup procedures before any effective use. Specific and personalized training sessions are needed. In addition, performers have to indicate clear separations between gestures, namely, specifying pre- and post-strokes as well as the gesture used to perform the command. Thus, time series segmentation appears as a central problem. Indeed, clustering human motions into meaningful segments or isolating meaningful segments forming a continuous movement flow present the same problem: how to find the post and the pre strokes. For machine learning, this problem is solved by having training sets of carefully labeled data. Good segmentation improves the quality of the gesture recognition-based interface. In our contribution, we focus on developing a non-parametric stochastic segmentation algorithm. Once the segmentation has been validated, we show how any novice user can create in a semi-supervised way, his or her, own gestures library. In addition, we show how the obtained system is efficient in finding meaningful gestures (the once learned earlier) within continuous movements flow, thus removing the constraint of performing manual specification of respectively the beginning of the movement and its end. The proposed technique is assessed through a real-life example, where a novice user creates an ad-hoc interface to control a robot in a natural way."
886940,15514,23735,Time scaled collision cone based trajectory optimization approach for reactive planning in dynamic environments,2014,"The current paper proposes a trajectory optimization approach for navigating a non-holonomic wheeled mobile robot in dynamic environments. The dynamic obstacle's motion is not known and hence is represented by a band of predicted trajectories. The trajectory optimization can account for large number of predicted obstacle trajectories and seeks to avoid each predicted trajectory of every obstacle in the sensing range of the robot. The two primary contributions of the proposed trajectory optimization are (1): A computationally efficient method for computing the intersection space of collision avoidance constraints of large number of predicted obstacle trajectories. (2): A optimization framework to connect the current state to the solution space in time optimal fashion. The intersection/solution space computation is build on our earlier proposed concept of time scaled collision cone, which can be solved in closed form to obtain a set of formulae. These formulae describe how much and in what manner the temporal specification of a trajectory needs to be changed to avoid a given set of dynamic obstacles. This allows us to quickly evaluate solution space of time scaled collision cone over various candidate trajectories, thus reducing the problem of computing the intersection space to that of generating multiple homotopic trajectories. The optimization framework used to connect the current state to the solution space in time optimal fashion is based on the concept of non-linear time scaling, which induces a difference of convex form structure. Thus, on the theoretical side, we show that the various components of the proposed framework are computationally simple and involves solving sets of linear equations and using state of the art convex programming techniques. On the practical side we show that the proposed planner performs better than sampling based planners which treat dynamic obstacles as static over a short duration of time"
1459501,15514,23634,Efficient Accelerated Coordinate Descent Methods and Faster Algorithms for Solving Linear Systems,2013,"In this paper we show how to accelerate randomized coordinate descent methods and achieve faster convergence rates without paying per-iteration costs in asymptotic running time. In particular, we show how to generalize and efficiently implement a method proposed by Nesterov, giving faster asymptotic running times for various algorithms that use standard coordinate descent as a black box. In addition to providing a proof of convergence for this new general method, we show that it is numerically stable, efficiently implementable, and in certain regimes, asymptotically optimal. To highlight the power of this algorithm, we show how it can used to create faster linear system solvers in several regimes: - We show how this method achieves a faster asymptotic runtime than conjugate gradient for solving a broad class of symmetric positive definite systems of equations. - We improve the convergence guarantees for Kaczmarz methods, a popular technique for image reconstruction and solving over determined systems of equations, by accelerating an algorithm of Strohmer and Vershynin. - We achieve the best known running time for solving Symmetric Diagonally Dominant (SDD) system of equations in the unit-cost RAM model, obtaining a running time of O(m log3/2n (log log n)1/2 log((log n)/eps)) by accelerating a recent solver by Kelner et al. Beyond the independent interest of these solvers, we believe they highlight the versatility of the approach of this paper and we hope that they will open the door for further algorithmic improvements in the future."
2782469,15514,23684,A near-optimal planarization algorithm,2014,"The problem of testing whether a graph is planar has been studied for over half a century, and is known to be solvable in O(n) time using a myriad of different approaches and techniques. Robertson and Seymour established the existence of a cubic algorithm for the more general problem of deciding whether an n-vertex graph can be made planar by at most k vertex deletions, for every fixed k. Of the known algorithms for k-Vertex Planarization, the algorithm of Marx and Schlotter (WG 2007, Algorithmica 2012) running in time 2kO(k3·n2 achieves the best running time dependence on k. The algorithm of Kawarabayashi (FOCS 2009), running in time f(k)n for some f(k) e Ω(2kΩ(k3)) that is not stated explicitly, achieves the best dependence on n.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we present an algorithm for k-Vertex Planarization with running time 2O(k log k) · n, significantly improving the running time dependence on k without compromising the linear dependence on n. Our main technical contribution is a novel scheme to reduce the treewidth of the input graph to O(k) in time 2O(k log k) · n. It combines new insights into the structure of graphs that become planar after contracting a matching, with a Baker-type subroutine that reduces the number of disjoint paths through planar parts of the graph that are not affected by the sought solution. To solve the reduced instances we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm for Weighted Vertex Planarization on graphs of treewidth w with running time 2O(w log w) · n, thereby improving over previous double-exponential algorithms.#R##N##R##N#While Kawarabayashi's planarization algorithm relies heavily on deep results from the graph minors project, our techniques are elementary and practically self-contained. We expect them to be applicable to related edge-deletion and contraction variants of planarization problems."
672091,15514,11321,Near-Optimal Joint Object Matching via Convex Relaxation,2014,"Joint object matching aims at aggregating information from a large collection of similar instances (e.g. images, graphs, shapes) to improve the correspondences computed between pairs of objects, typically by exploiting global map compatibility. Despite some practical advances on this problem, from the theoretical point of view, the error-correction ability of existing algorithms are limited by a constant barrier — none of them can provably recover the correct solution when more than a constant fraction of input correspondences are corrupted. Moreover, prior approaches focus mostly on fully similar objects, while it is practically more demanding and realistic to match instances that are only partially similar to each other. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to jointly match multiple objects that exhibit only partial similarities, where the provided pairwise feature correspondences can be densely corrupted. By encoding a consistent partial map collection into a 0-1 semidefinite matrix, we attempt recovery via a two-step procedure, that is, a spectral technique followed by a parameter-free convex program called MatchLift. Under a natural randomized model, MatchLift exhibits nearoptimal error-correction ability, i.e. it guarantees the recovery of the ground-truth maps even when a dominant fraction of the inputs are randomly corrupted. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on various benchmark data sets including synthetic examples and real-world examples, all of which confirm the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm."
1377657,15514,23735,Manipulator state estimation with low cost accelerometers and gyroscopes,2012,"Robot manipulator designs are increasingly focused on low cost approaches, especially those envisioned for use in unstructured environments such as households, office spaces and hazardous environments. The cost of angular sensors varies based on the precision offered. For tasks in these environments, millimeter order manipulation errors are unlikely to cause drastic reduction in performance. In this paper, estimates the joint angles of a manipulator using low cost triaxial accelerometers by taking the difference between consecutive acceleration vectors. The accelerometer-based angle is compensated with a uniaxial gyroscope using a complementary filter to give robust measurements. Three compensation strategies are compared: complementary filter, time varying complementary filter, and extended Kalman filter. This sensor setup can also accurately track the joint angle even when the joint axis is parallel to gravity and the accelerometer data does not provide useful information. In order to analyze this strategy, accelerometers and gyroscopes were mounted on one arm of a PR2 robot. The arm was manually moved smoothly through different trajectories in its workspace while the joint angle readings from the on-board optical encoders were compared against the joint angle estimates from the accelerometers and gyroscopes. The low cost angle estimation strategy has a mean error 1.3° over the three joints estimated, resulting in mean end effector position errors of 6.1 mm or less. This system provides an effective angular measurement as an alternative to high precision encoders in low cost manipulators and as redundant measurements for safety in other manipulators."
691596,15514,23735,"Shrinkable, stiffness-controllable soft manipulator based on a bio-inspired antagonistic actuation principle",2014,"This paper explores a new hybrid actuation principle combining pneumatic and tendon-driven actuators for a soft robotic manipulator. The fusion of these two actuation principles leads to an overall antagonistic actuation mechanism whereby pneumatic actuation opposes tendon actuation - a mechanism commonly found in animals where muscles can oppose each other to vary joint stiffness. We are taking especially inspiration from the octopus who belongs to the class of Cephalopoda; the octopus uses its longitudinal and transversal muscles in its arms to achieve varied motion patterns; activating both sets of muscles, the octopus can control the arm stiffness over a wide range. Our approach mimics this behavior and achieves comparable motion patterns, including bending, elongation and stiffening. The proposed method combines the advantages of tendon-driven and pneumatic actuated systems and goes beyond what current soft, flexible robots can achieve: because the new robot structure is effectively an inflatable, sleeve, it can be pumped up to its fully inflated volume and, also, completely deflated and shrunk. Since, in the deflated state, it comprises just its outer “skin” and tendons, the robot can be compressed to a very small size, many times smaller when compared to its fully-inflated state. In this paper, we describe the mechanical structure of the soft manipulator. Proof-of-concept experiments focus on the robot's ability to bend, to morph from completely shrunk to entirely inflated as well as to vary its stiffness."
1199430,15514,65,Comfortable approach distance with small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,2013,"This paper presents the first known human-subject study of comfortable approach distance and height for human interaction with a small unmanned aerial vehicle (sUAV), finding no conclusive difference in comfort with a sUAV approaching a human at above head height or below head height. Understanding the amount, if any, of discomfort introduced by a sUAV flying in close proximity to a human is critical for law enforcement, crowd control, entertainment, or flying personal assistants. Previous work has focused on how humans interact with each other or with unmanned ground vehicles, and the experimental methods typically rely on the human participant to consciously express distress. The approach taken was to duplicate the experimental set up in human proxemics studies, while adding psychophysiological sensing, under the hypothesis that human-robot interaction will mirror human-human interaction. The 16 participant, within-subjects experiment did not confirm this hypothesis. Instead a sUAV above height of a “tall” person in human experiments (2.13 m) did not produce statistically different heart rate variability nor cause the participant to stop the robot further away than for a sUAV at a “short” height (1.52 m). The lack of effect may be due to two possible confounds: i) duplicating prior human proxemics experiments did not capture how a sUAV would likely move or interact and ii) telling the participants that the robot could not hurt them. Despite possible confounding, the results raise the question of whether human-human psychological and physical distancing behavior transfers to human-aerial robot interactions."
939440,15514,23684,Improved approximation results for stochastic knapsack problems,2011,"In the  stochastic knapsack  problem, we are given a set of items each associated with a probability distribution on sizes and a profit, and a knapsack of unit capacity. The size of an item is revealed as soon as it is inserted into the knapsack, and the goal is to design a  policy  that maximizes the expected profit of items that are successfully inserted into the knapsack. The stochastic knapsack problem is a natural generalization of the classical knapsack problem, and arises in many applications, including bandwidth allocation, budgeted learning, and scheduling.   An  adaptive  policy for stochastic knapsack specifies the next item to be inserted based on observed sizes of the items inserted thus far. The adaptive policy can have an exponentially large explicit description and is known to be PSPACE-hard to compute. The best known approximation for this problem is a (3 + e)-approximation for any e > 0. Our first main result is a relaxed PTAS (Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme) for the adaptive policy, that is, for any e > 0, we present a poly-time computable (1 + e)-approximate adaptive policy when knapsack capacity is relaxed to 1+e. At a high-level, the proof is based on transforming an arbitrary collection of item size distributions to  canonical  item size distributions that admit a compact description. We then establish a  coupling  that shows a (1 + e)-approximation can be achieved for the original problem by a canonical policy that makes decisions at each step by observing events drawn from the sample space of canonical size distributions. Finally, we give a mechanism for approximating the optimal canonical policy.   Our second main result is an (8/3 + e)-approximate adaptive policy for any e > 0 without relaxing the knapsack capacity, improving the earlier (3 + e)-approximation result. Interestingly, we obtain this result by using the PTAS described above. We establish an existential result that the optimal policy for the knapsack with capacity 1 can be  folded  to get a policy with expected profit 3OPT/8 for a knapsack with capacity (1 − e), with capacity relaxed to 1  only  for the first item inserted. We then use our PTAS result to compute the (1 + e)-approximation to such policy.   Our techniques also yield a relaxed PTAS for  non-adaptive  policies. Finally, we also show that our ideas can be extended to yield improved approximation guarantees for multi-dimensional and fixed set variants of the stochastic knapsack problem."
29769,15514,23684,Outperforming LRU via competitive analysis on parametrized inputs for paging,2012,"Competitive analysis was often criticized because of its too pessimistic guarantees which do not reflect the behavior of paging algorithms in practice. For instance, many deterministic paging algorithms achieve the optimal competitive ratio of k, yet LRU and its variants clearly outperform the rest in practice. In this paper we aim to reuse and refine insights from the competitive analysis to obtain new algorithms that cause few cache misses in practice. We propose a new measure of the evilness of the adversary, which results in a parametrization of the input that we denote attack rate. This measure is based on the characterization in [22] of the optimal offline algorithm and uses the fact that a number of pages are for sure in its memory. We show that the attack rate r is a tight bound on the competitive ratio of deterministic paging algorithms and give experimental results which show that r is usually much smaller than the cache size k and thus provides more realistic upper bounds for the competitive ratio of existing algorithms. Furthermore, we show that our input parametrization compares favorably concerning the fault rate with approaches based on locality of reference by Albers et al. [2] and Dorrigiv et al. [14] We use a priority-based framework, which always yields r-competitive algorithms regardless of the priority assignment. In this framework, LRU can be obtained under a certain priority assignment and is thus only one algorithm among many other r-competitive ones. Using the enhanced flexibility given by this framework, we give a priority policy which leads to an algorithm outperforming LRU, RLRU and other practical algorithms on a wide selection of real-world cache traces."

The main intention is to offer a practical course including hands-on experiences being close to current research topics in the field of mobile robotics. For this purpose, a commercial mobile robot is equipped with state of the art sensors, allowing autonomous execution of manipulation tasks. The course consists of three thematical sections. At the beginning of each, lectures provide the theoretical background. On this basis, the participants are addressed to develop algorithms and to solve specific tasks, delivered in homework packages, self-reliantly or in a team. Finally, the developed software components need to be merged to solve a predefined scenario, e.g. autonomous part handling. At the end of a thematic section, students demonstrate their developed solutions within a challenge and explain their approaches in a presentation. Starting with teleoperation and object recognition, the RobotChallenge ends up with navigation in unknown terrain. Besides others, the participants acquire soft-skills, such as project and team management. Being carried out for the first time in winter term 2011/2012, the RobotChallenge successfully promotes profound understanding of mobile robotics that is applied during practical experiences.

1110768,15514,65,FMRI study of young adults with autism interacting with a humanoid robot,2012,"The belief that artificial agents are useful interaction partners in cognitive therapies of social disorders such as autism fuels an increasing number of research projects involving the developments of robots and computer avatars. Yet, for an appropriate use of these new tools, it is necessary to understand how perception of and interaction with artificial agents differ from natural agents, both in normally developed adults and in patients with disorders of social cognition. Here we investigated the neural bases of social interactions with a human or with a humanoid robot using fMRI. During interaction, participants were playing a computerized version of the game chifumi (stone-paper-scissors), while believing they were interacting ‘live’ either with a fellow human (Intentional agent, Int), a humanoid robot endowed with an artificial intelligence (Artificial agent, Art), or a random number generator running on a laptop (Rnd). The belief was built both with an extensive briefing before the actual experiment, including a live interaction with the human and humanoid robot opponents, and with videos of the opponent, presented as live but actually recorded prior to the experiment, that preceded and followed each series of 5 games played against one opponent in a block. Results indicate that the brain network found when interacting with an active opponent (Art & Int vs Rnd) was more activated when interacting with the human than with the robot agent, implying that interacting with a human is more engaging than interacting with an artificial agent. Areas involved in social interactions in the posterior temporal sulcus were activated when controls, but not high-functioning autistic patients patients, interacted with a fellow human."
1299614,15514,23634,Noisy Interactive Quantum Communication,2014,"We study the problem of simulating protocols in a quantum communication setting over noisy channels. This problem falls at the intersection of quantum information theory and quantum communication complexity, and will be of importance for eventual real-world applications of interactive quantum protocols, which can be proved to have exponentially lower communication costs than their classical counterparts for some problems. These are the first results concerning the quantum version of this problem, originally studied by Schulman in a classical setting (FOCS '92, STOC '93). We simulate a length N quantum communication protocol by a length O(N) protocol with arbitrarily small error. Our simulation strategy has a far higher communication rate than a naive one that encodes separately each particular round of communication to achieve comparable success. Such a strategy would have a communication rate going to 0 in the worst interaction case as the length of the protocols increases, in contrast to our strategy, which has a communication rate proportional to the capacity of the channel used. Under adversarial noise, our strategy can withstand, for arbitrarily small aepsi; > 0, error rates as high as 1/2 -- aepsi; when parties preshare perfect entanglement, but the classical channel is noisy. We show that this is optimal. Note that in this model, the naive strategy would not work for any constant fraction of errors. We provide extension of these results in several other models of communication, including when also the entanglement is noisy, and when there is no pre-shared entanglement but communication is quantum and noisy. We also study the case of random noise, for which we provide simulation protocols with positive communication rates and no pre-shared entanglement over some quantum channels with quantum capacity Q = 0, proving that Q is in general not the right characterization of a channel's capacity for interactive quantum communication. Our results are stated for a general quantum communication protocol in which Alice and Bob collaborate, and hold in particular in the quantum communication complexity settings of the Yao and Cleve-Buhrman models."
1781733,15514,23735,FAS A flexible antagonistic spring element for a high performance over actuated hand,2011,"In robotic hands design tendon driven systems have been considered for years. The main advantage is a small end effector inertia e.g. a light, small hand with high dynamics due to remote actuators. To protect the actuators from impact in unknown environments a compliant mechanism can be used. It absorbs energy during an impact or saves energy to enhance the joint dynamics. In this paper an antagonistic tendon mechanism is presented. It fits 38 times in the DLR Hand Arm System forearm and enables is adapted to the different finger joints and different tendon lengths. A magnetic sensor was developed for the force measurement of the tendons. Finally, the calibration and the robustness are demonstrated through a set of experiments. the tendon has no load. Moreover, it results in an increased tendon inertia. The points shown above and the creep of the tendons (Fig. 3) lead to the choice of an antagonistic configuration. Based on the mechanism shown in (6), a new mechanism that fits 38 times into the forearm has been designed. It can be tuned to the different needed force to deflection behaviors by modifying the equilibrium point, the spring rate and the spring position regarding the lever. In this paper the development of a highly integrated variable stiffness element is presented. In the first section, the mechanism is presented along with the constraints it has to fulfill. A second section presents the test system used to verify and calibrate the sensors. Finally, the third section gives primilinary results on the tendon force control performance, that can be achieved using this sensor."
544054,15514,23684,Better bounds for matchings in the streaming model,2013,"In this paper we present improved bounds for approximating maximum matchings in bipartite graphs in the streaming model. First, we consider the question of how well maximum matching can be approximated in a single pass over the input when O(n) space is allowed, where n is the number of vertices in the input graph. Two natural variants of this problem have been considered in the literature: (1) the edge arrival setting, where edges arrive in the stream and (2) the vertex arrival setting, where vertices on one side of the graph arrive in the stream together with all their incident edges. The latter setting has also been studied extensively in the context of on-line algorithms, where each arriving vertex has to either be matched irrevocably or discarded upon arrival. In the online setting, the celebrated algorithm of Karp-Vazirani-Vazirani achieves a 1--1/e approximation by crucially using randomization (and using O(n) space). Despite the fact that the streaming model is less restrictive in that the algorithm is not constrained to match vertices irrevocably upon arrival, the best known approximation in the streaming model with vertex arrivals and O(n) space is the same factor of 1--1/e.#R##N##R##N#We show that no (possibly randomized) single pass streaming algorithm constrained to use O(n) space can achieve a better than 1--1/e approximation to maximum matching, even in the vertex arrival setting. This leads to the striking conclusion that no single pass streaming algorithm can get any advantage over online algorithms unless it uses significantly more than O(n) space. Additionally, our bound yields the best known impossibility result for approximating matchings in the edge arrival model (improving upon the bound of 2/3 proved by Goel at al[SODA'12]).#R##N##R##N#Second, we consider the problem of approximating matchings in multiple passes in the vertex arrival setting.

1255396,15514,23735,A practical obstacle detection system for autonomous orchard vehicles,2012,"Safe robot navigation in tree fruit orchards requires that the vehicle be capable of robustly navigating between rows of trees and turning from one aisle to another; that the vehicle be dynamically stable, especially when carrying workers; and that the vehicle be able to detect obstacles on its way and adjust its speed accordingly. In this paper we address the latter, in particular the problem of detecting people and apple bins in the aisles between rows. One of our requirements is that the obstacle avoidance subsystem shouldn't add to the robot's hardware cost, so as to keep the acquisition cost to growers as low as possible. Therefore, we confine ourselves to solutions that use only the sensor suite already installed on the robot for navigation-in our case, a laser scanner, low-cost inertial measurement unit, and steering and wheel encoders. Our methodology is based on the classification and clustering of registered 3D points as obstacles. In the current implementation, obstacle avoidance takes in 3D point clouds collected in apple orchards and generates an off-line assessment of obstacle position. Tests conducted at our experimental orchard-like environment in Pittsburgh and an actual apple orchard in Washington state indicate that the method is able to detect people and bins located along the vehicle path. Stretch tests indicate that it is also capable of dealing with objects as small as 15 cm tall as long as they aren't covered by grass, and to detect people crossing the aisles at walking speed."
712464,15514,23634,Enumerative Lattice Algorithms in any Norm Via M-ellipsoid Coverings,2011,"We give a novel algorithm for enumerating lattice points in any convex body, and give applications to several classic lattice problems, including the Shortest and Closest Vector Problems (SVP and CVP, respectively) and Integer Programming (IP). Our enumeration technique relies on a classical concept from asymptotic convex geometry known as the M-ellipsoid, and uses as a crucial subroutine the recent algorithm of Micciancio and Voulgaris (STOC 2010)for lattice problems in the l2 norm. As a main technical contribution, which may be of independent interest, we build on the techniques of Klartag (Geometric and Functional Analysis, 2006) to give an expected 2^O(n)-time algorithm for computing an M-ellipsoid for any n-dimensional convex body. As applications, we give deterministic 2^O(n)-time and -space algorithms for solving exact SVP, and exact CVP when the target point is sufficiently close to the lattice, on n-dimensional lattices in any (semi-)norm given an M-ellipsoid of the unit ball. In many norms of interest, including all lp norms, an M-ellipsoid is computable in deterministic poly(n) time, in which case these algorithms are fully deterministic. Here our approach may be seen as a derandomization of the âAKS sieveâfor exact SVP and CVP (Ajtai, Kumar, and Siva Kumar, STOC2001 and CCC 2002). As a further application of our SVP algorithm, we derive an expected O(f*(n))^n-time algorithm for Integer Programming, where f*(n) denotes the optimal bound in the so-called âflatnesstheorem, â which satisfies f*(n) = O(n^(4/3) polylog(n))and is conjectured to be f*(n) = O(n). Our runtime improves upon the previous best of O(n^2)^n by Hildebrand and Koppe(2010)."
499506,15514,23684,Near linear time approximation schemes for uncapacitated and capacitated b-matching problems in nonbipartite graphs,2014,"We present the first fully polynomial approximation schemes for the maximum weighted (uncapacitated or capacitated) b-Matching problem for nonbipartite graphs that run in time (near) linear in the number of edges, that is, given any δ > 0 the algorithm produces a (1 -- δ) approximation in O(m poly(δ-1, log n)) time. We provide fractional solutions for the standard linear programming formulations for these problems and subsequently also provide fully polynomial (near) linear time approximation schemes for rounding the fractional solutions.#R##N##R##N#Through these problems as a vehicle, we also present several ideas in the context of solving linear programs approximately using fast primal-dual algorithms. First, we show that approximation algorithms can be used to reduce the width of the formulation, and as a consequence we induce faster convergence. Second, even though the dual of these problems have exponentially many variables and an efficient exact computation of dual weights is infeasible, we can efficiently compute and use a sparse approximation of the dual weights using a combination of (i) adding perturbation to the constraints of the polytope and (ii) amplification followed by thresholding of the dual weights.#R##N##R##N#These algorithms also have the advantage that they use O(n poly(δ-1, log n)) storage space and only make O(δ-4 log2(1/δ) log n) (or better) passes over a read only list of edges. These algorithms therefore can be run in the semi-streaming model and serve as exemplars where algorithms and ideas developed for the streaming model gives us algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems that were not known in absence of the streaming constraints."
1321332,15514,23735,Eliciting collective behaviors through automatically generated environments,2013,"Many groups of agents exhibit emergent collective behaviors. The environment in which the agents operate is one determinant of the resulting behaviors. This work shows how automatic enumeration of environments enables exploration of various collective behaviors that perform useful group functions (e.g. segregation, corralling, shape formation). Although groups of agents, such as mobile robots, can be manipulated through explicit control, this study shows that these systems can be usefully manipulated without resorting to such imperative means. This method has obvious uses for heterogeneous robot systems, especially those which include large numbers of simple agents. The method introduced is general, in that it takes as input: (1) algorithmic specifications of the environment generation, (2) a black-box model of the individual agent's control laws, and (3) a mathematical description of the task objective. To show the validity of the proposed method this investigation studies two behaviors (splitting and corralling) for three commonly studied motion models, including the well known Reynold's model. Simulations and physical multi-robot trials show that automatically generated environments can elicit pre-specified behaviors from a group of individual agents. Additionally, this work investigates the effects of a group's emergent properties on the ability to elicit the specified behavior via the environment. The findings suggest that automatically exploring environments can lead to better exploration and understanding of collective behaviors, including the identification of previously unknown emergent behaviors."
501770,15514,23684,Prophet inequalities with limited information,2014,"In the classical prophet inequality, a gambler observes a sequence of stochastic rewards V1, ..., Vn and must decide, for each reward Vi, whether to keep it and stop the game or to forfeit the reward forever and reveal the next value Vi. The gambler's goal is to obtain a constant fraction of the expected reward that the optimal offline algorithm would get. Recently, prophet inequalities have been generalized to settings where the gambler can choose k items, and, more generally, where he can choose any independent set in a matroid. However, all the existing algorithms require the gambler to know the distribution from which the rewards V1, ..., Vn are drawn.#R##N##R##N#The assumption that the gambler knows the distribution from which V1, ..., Vn are drawn is very strong. Instead, we work with the much simpler assumption that the gambler only knows a few samples from this distribution. We construct the first single-sample prophet inequalities for many settings of interest, whose guarantees all match the best possible asymptotically, even with full knowledge of the distribution. Specifically, we provide a novel single-sample algorithm when the gambler can choose any k elements whose analysis is based on random walks with limited correlation. In addition, we provide a black-box method for converting specific types of solutions to the related secretary problem to single-sample prophet inequalities, and apply it to several existing algorithms. Finally, we provide a constant-sample prophet inequality for constant-degree bipartite matchings.#R##N##R##N#In addition, we apply these results to design the first posted-price and multi-dimensional auction mechanisms with limited information in settings with asymmetric bidders. Connections between prophet inequalities and posted-price mechanisms are already known, but applying the existing framework requires knowledge of the underlying distributions, as well as the so-called virtual values even when the underlying prophet inequalities do not. We therefore provide an extension of this framework that bypasses virtual values altogether, allowing our mechanisms to take full advantage of the limited information required by our new prophet inequalities."
1058637,15514,23735,Learning muscle activation patterns via nonlinear oscillators: Application to lower-limb assistance,2013,"Achieving coordination between a lower-limb exoskeleton and its user is challenging because walking is a dynamic process that involves multiple, precisely timed muscle activations. Electromyographical (EMG) feedback, in spite of its drawbacks, provides an avenue for assistance by enabling users to reduce the level of muscle activation required for walking. As an alternative to direct EMG feedback, we present a method for exoskeleton control based on learning the activation pattern of specific muscles during cyclic movements. Using the example of pendular leg motion, the torque profile of one muscle group (hip flexors) is learned in a two-step process. First, the estimated torque profile is indexed to the phase of the swing movement using an adaptive frequency oscillator (AFO). The profile is then encoded using linear weighted regression. In the algorithm's assistive mode, the learned profile is reconstructed by means of the AFO and without need for additional EMG input. The reconstructed profile is converted into a torque profile to be physically delivered by the exoskeleton. We tested our method on a single-actuator exoskeleton that assists the hip joint during stationary leg swing. The learning and assistance functions were built on top of an admittance controller that enhances the exoskeleton's mechanical transparency. Initial tests showed a high level of coordination, i.e. simultaneous positive work, between the subjects' hip flexor torque and the exoskeleton's assistive torque. This result opens the door for future studies to test the users' ability to reduce their muscle activation in proportion to the assistance delivered by the exoskeleton."

In fact, we obtain the same bound for the harder problem of three-sided orthogonal range reporting. In this problem, we are to preprocess a set of n two-dimensional points in rank space, such that all points inside a query rectangle of the form [x1, x2] x (−∞, y] can be reported. The best previous bounds for this problem is either O(n lg2B n) space and O(1 + k/B) query I/Os, or O(n) space and O(lg(h)B n + k/B) query I/Os, where lg(h)B n is the base B logarithm iterated h times, for any constant integer h. The previous bounds are both achieved under the indivisibility assumption, while our solution exploits the full capabilities of the underlying machine. Breaking the indivisibility assumption thus provides us with cleaner and optimal bounds.#R##N##R##N#Our results also imply an optimal solution to the following colored prefix reporting problem. Given a set S of strings, each O(1) disk blocks in length, and a function c: S → 2>{1,...,σ}, support queries of the kind: Given a string p, report the set [EQUATION], where p* denotes the set of strings with prefix p.

611446,15514,20332,Toward addressing human behavior with observational uncertainty in security games,2011,"Stackelberg games have recently gained significant attention for resource allocation decisions in security settings. One critical assumption of traditional Stackelberg models is that all players are perfectly rational and that the followers perfectly observe the leader's strategy. However, in real-world security settings, security agencies must deal with human adversaries who may not always follow the utility maximizing rational strategy. Accounting for these likely deviations is important since they may adversely affect the leader's (security agency's) utility. In fact, a number of behavioral gametheoretic models have begun to emerge for these domains. Two such models in particular are COBRA (Combined Observability and Bounded Rationality Assumption) and BRQR (Best Response to Quantal Response), which have both been shown to outperform game-theoretic optimal models against human adversaries within a security setting based on Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Under perfect observation conditions, BRQR has been shown to be the leading contender for addressing human adversaries. In this work we explore these models under limited observation conditions. Due to human anchoring biases, BRQR's performance may suffer under limited observation conditions. An anchoring bias is when, given no information about the occurrence of a discrete set of events, humans will tend to assign an equal weight to the occurrence of each event (a uniform distribution). This study makes three main contributions: (i) we incorporate an anchoring bias into BRQR to improve performance under limited observation; (ii) we explore finding appropriate parameter settings for BRQR under limited observation; (iii) we compare BRQR's performance versus COBRA under limited observation conditions."
1452940,15514,23634,"On the Complexity of Commuting Local Hamiltonians, and Tight Conditions for Topological Order in Such Systems",2011,"The local Hamiltonian problem plays the equivalent role of SAT in quantum complexity theory. Understanding the complexity of the intermediate case in which the constraints are quantum but all local terms in the Hamiltonian commute, is of importance for conceptual, physical and computational complexity reasons. Bravyi and Vyalyi showed in 2003, using a clever application of the representation theory of C*-algebras, that if the terms in the Hamiltonian are all two-local, the problem is in NP, and the entanglement in the ground states is local. The general case remained open since then. In this paper we extend this result beyond the two-local case, to the case of three-qubit interactions. We then extend our results even further, and show that NP verification is possible for three-wise interaction between qutrits as well, as long as the interaction graph is planar and also  nearly Euclidean & quot, in some well-defined sense. The proofs imply that in all such systems, the entanglement in the ground states is local. These extensions imply an intriguing sharp transition phenomenon in commuting Hamiltonian systems: the ground spaces of 3-local  physical & quot, systems based on qubits and qutrits are diagonalizable by a basis whose entanglement is highly local, while even slightly more involved interactions (the particle dimensionality or the locality of the interaction is larger) already exhibit an important long-range entanglement property called Topological Order. Our results thus imply that Kitaev's celebrated Toric code construction is, in a well defined sense, optimal as a construction of Topological Order based on commuting Hamiltonians."
1560842,15514,23735,Surface sensor networks for Underwater Vehicle positioning with bearings-only measurements,2012,"There is increasing interest in the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to substantially improve the means available for ocean exploration and exploitation. A key element in the operation of certain classes of AUVs is the availability of good underwater positioning systems to localize one or more vehicles simultaneously based on information received on-board a support ship or a set of autonomous surface vehicles. In an interesting operational scenario, the set of autonomous surface vehicles carries a network of acoustic units that measure the elevation and azimuth angles between the target and each of the receivers. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper we address the problem of determining the optimal geometric configuration of an acoustic sensor network at the ocean surface that will maximize the angle-related information available for underwater target positioning. It is assumed that the angle measurements are corrupted by white Gaussian noise, the variance of which is distance-dependent. Using the Cramer-Rao lower bound inequality, the trace of the inverse of the Fisher Information matrix (also called the Cramer-Rao Bound matrix) for the problem at hand is used to determine the sensor configuration that yields the minimum possible covariance of any unbiased target estimator. It is shown that the optimal configuration lends itself to an interesting geometrical interpretation and that the spreading of the sensor configuration depends explicitly on the intensity of the measurement noise and the target depth. Simulation examples illustrate the key results derived."
2455195,15514,23634,Faster SDP Hierarchy Solvers for Local Rounding Algorithms,2012,"Convex relaxations based on different hierarchies of linear/semi-definite programs have been used recently to devise approximation algorithms for various optimization problems. The approximation guarantee of these algorithms improves with the number of {\em rounds} $r$ in the hierarchy, though the complexity of solving (or even writing down the solution for) the $r$'th level program grows as $n^{\Omega(r)}$ where $n$ is the input size. In this work, we observe that many of these algorithms are based on {\em local} rounding procedures that only use a small part of the SDP solution (of size $n^{O(1)} 2^{O(r)}$ instead of $n^{\Omega(r)}$). We give an algorithm to find the requisite portion in time polynomial in its size. The challenge in achieving this is that the required portion of the solution is not fixed a priori but depends on other parts of the solution, sometimes in a complicated iterative manner. Our solver leads to $n^{O(1)} 2^{O(r)}$ time algorithms to obtain the same guarantees in many cases as the earlier $n^{O(r)}$ time algorithms based on $r$ rounds of the Lasserre hierarchy. In particular, guarantees based on $O(\log n)$ rounds can be realized in polynomial time. For instance, one can (i) get $O(1/\lambda_r)$ approximations for graph partitioning problems such as minimum bisection and small set expansion in $n^{O(1)} 2^{O(r)}$ time, where $\lambda_r$ is the $r$'th smallest eigenvalue of the graph's normalized Laplacian, (ii) a similar guarantee in $n^{O(1)} k^{O(r)}$ for Unique Games where $k$ is the number of labels (the polynomial dependence on $k$ is new), and (iii) find an independent set of size $\Omega(n)$ in $3$-colorable graphs in $(n 2^r)^{O(1)}$ time provided $\lambda_{n-r}"
737362,15514,23735,Efficient seabed coverage path planning for ASVs and AUVs,2012,"Coverage path planning is the problem of moving an effector (e.g. a robot, a sensor) over all points in a given region. In marine robotics, a number of applications require to cover a region on the seafloor while navigating above it at a constant depth. This is the case of Autonomous Surface Vehicles, that always navigate at the water surface level, but also of several Autonomous Underwater Vehicle tasks as well. Most existing coverage algorithms sweep the free space in the target region using lawnmower-like back-and-forth motions, and the inter-lap spacing between these back-and-forth laps is determined by the robot's sensor coverage range. However, while covering the seafloor surface by navigating above it at a constant depth, the sensor's field of view varies depending on the seafloor height. Therefore, to ensure full coverage one would need to use the inter-lap spacing determined by the shallowest point on the target surface, resulting in undesired coverage overlapping among the back-and-forth laps. In this work, we propose a novel method to generate a coverage path that completely covers a surface of interest on the seafloor by navigating in a constant-depth plane above it. The proposed method uses environment information to minimize the coverage overlapping by segmenting the target surface in regions of similar depth features and addressing them as individual coverage path planning problems. A cell decomposition coverage method is applied to each region. The surface gradient is used to determine the best sweep orientation in each cell, and the inter-lap spacing in the lawnmower-like paths used to cover each cell is maximized on a lap-by-lap basis, hence obtaining a shorter, more efficient coverage path. The proposal is validated in simulation experiments conducted with a real-world bathymetric dataset that show a significant increase on path efficiency in comparison with a standard boustrophedon coverage path."
608725,15514,23922,Learning Coverage Functions and Private Release of Marginals,2013,"We study the problem of approximating and learning coverage functions. A function $c: 2^{[n]} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{+}$ is a coverage function, if there exists a universe $U$ with non-negative weights $w(u)$ for each $u \in U$ and subsets $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ of $U$ such that $c(S) = \sum_{u \in \cup_{i \in S} A_i} w(u)$. Alternatively, coverage functions can be described as non-negative linear combinations of monotone disjunctions. They are a natural subclass of submodular functions and arise in a number of applications. #R##N#We give an algorithm that for any $\gamma,\delta>0$, given random and uniform examples of an unknown coverage function $c$, finds a function $h$ that approximates $c$ within factor $1+\gamma$ on all but $\delta$-fraction of the points in time $poly(n,1/\gamma,1/\delta)$. This is the first fully-polynomial algorithm for learning an interesting class of functions in the demanding PMAC model of Balcan and Harvey (2011). Our algorithms are based on several new structural properties of coverage functions. Using the results in (Feldman and Kothari, 2014), we also show that coverage functions are learnable agnostically with excess $\ell_1$-error $\epsilon$ over all product and symmetric distributions in time $n^{\log(1/\epsilon)}$. In contrast, we show that, without assumptions on the distribution, learning coverage functions is at least as hard as learning polynomial-size disjoint DNF formulas, a class of functions for which the best known algorithm runs in time $2^{\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}$ (Klivans and Servedio, 2004). #R##N#As an application of our learning results, we give simple differentially-private algorithms for releasing monotone conjunction counting queries with low average error.

1643411,15514,507,Shortest path and distance queries on road networks: towards bridging theory and practice,2013,"Given two locations s and t in a road network, a distance query returns the minimum network distance from s to t, while a shortest path query computes the actual route that achieves the minimum distance. These two types of queries find important applications in practice, and a plethora of solutions have been proposed in past few decades. The existing solutions, however, are optimized for either practical or asymptotic performance, but not both. In particular, the techniques with enhanced practical efficiency are mostly heuristic-based, and they offer unattractive worst-case guarantees in terms of space and time. On the other hand, the methods that are worst-case efficient often entail prohibitive preprocessing or space overheads, which render them inapplicable for the large road networks (with millions of nodes) commonly used in modern map applications.   This paper presents  Arterial Hierarchy (AH) , an index structure that narrows the gap between theory and practice in answering shortest path and distance queries on road networks. On the theoretical side, we show that, under a realistic assumption, AH answers any distance query in O(log α) time, where α =  d  max / d  min , and  d  max  (resp.  d  min ) is the largest (resp. smallest)  L  ∞  distance between any two nodes in the road network. In addition, any shortest path query can be answered in O( k  + log α) time, where k is the number of nodes on the shortest path. On the practical side, we experimentally evaluate AH on a large set of real road networks with up to twenty million nodes, and we demonstrate that (i) AH outperforms the state of the art in terms of query time, and (ii) its space and pre-computation overheads are moderate."

Executing jobs at high speeds and then setting the processor asleep is an approach that can lead to further energy savings compared to standard dynamic speed scaling. We consider classical deadline-based scheduling, i.e. each job is specified by a release time, a deadline and a processing volume. For general convex power functions, Irani et al. [12] devised an offline 2-approximation algorithm. Roughly speaking, the algorithm schedules jobs at a critical speed Scrit that yields the smallest energy consumption while jobs are processed. For power functions P(s) = sα + γ, where s is the processor speed, Han et al. [11] gave an (αα + 2)-competitive online algorithm.#R##N##R##N#We investigate the offline setting of speed scaling with a sleep state. First we prove NP-hardness of the optimization problem. Additionally, we develop lower bounds, for general convex power functions: No algorithm that constructs Scrit-schedules, which execute jobs at speeds of at least scrit, can achieve an approximation factor smaller than 2. Furthermore, no algorithm that minimizes the energy expended for processing jobs can attain an approximation ratio smaller than 2.#R##N##R##N#We then present an algorithmic framework for designing good approximation algorithms. For general convex power functions, we derive an approximation factor of 4/3. For power functions P(s) = βsα + γ, we obtain an approximation of 137/117 < 1.171. We finally show that our framework yields the best approximation guarantees for the class of Scrit-schedules. For general convex power functions, we give another 2-approximation algorithm. For functions P(s) = βsα + γ, we present tight upper and lower bounds on the best possible approximation factor.

1008461,15514,23634,"Simple Tabulation, Fast Expanders, Double Tabulation, and High Independence",2013,"Simple tabulation dates back to Zobrist in 1970 who used it for game playing programs. Keys are viewed as consisting of c characters from some alphabet Φ. We initialize c tables h 0 , ... , h c-1  mapping characters to random hash values. A key x = (x 0 , ... , x c-1 ) is hashed to h 0 [x 0 ]⊕· · ·⊕h c-1 [x c-1 ], where ⊕ denotes bit-wise exclusive-or. The scheme is extremely fast when the character hash tables h i  are in cache. Simple tabulation hashing is not even 4-independent, but we show here that if we apply it twice, then we do get high independence. First we hash to some intermediate keys that are 6 times longer than the original keys, and then we hash the intermediate keys to the final hash values. The intermediate keys have d = 6c characters from Φ. We can then view the hash function as a highly unbalanced bipartite graph with keys on one side, each with edges to d output characters on the other side. We show that this graph has nice expansion properties, and from that it follows that if we perform another level of simple tabulation on the intermediate keys, then the composition is a highly independent hash function. More precisely, the independence we get is |Φ|Ω (1/c) . In our O-notation, we view both |Φ| and c is going to infinity, but with c much smaller than |Φ|. Our space is O(c|Φ|) and the hash function is evaluated in O(c) time. Siegel [FOCS'89, SICOMP'04] has proved that with this space, if the hash function is evaluated in o(c) time, then the independence can only be o(c), so our evaluation time is best possible for Ω(c) independence-our independence is much higher if c = |Φ| o(1/c) . Siegel used O(c) c  evaluation time to get the same independence with similar space. Siegel's main focus was c = O(1), but we are exponentially faster when c = ω(1). Applying our scheme recursively, we can increase our independence to |Φ| Ω(1)  with o(c logc)  evaluation time. Compared with Siegel's scheme this is both faster and higher independence. Siegel states about his scheme that it is “far too slow for any practical application”. Our scheme is trivial to implement, and it does provide realistic implementations of 100-independent hashing for, say, 32-bit and 64-bit keys."
2653367,15514,23684,New approximations for reordering buffer management,2014,"In this paper we consider the buffer reordering management problem. In this model there are n elements that arrive over time with different colors. There is a buffer that can store up to k elements and when the buffer becomes full an element must be output. If an element is output that has a color different from the previous element, a cost depending on the color must be paid. This cost could be uniform or non-uniform over colors; these are called unweighted and weighted cases, respectively. The goal is to reorder elements within the buffer before outputting them to minimize the total cost incurred.#R##N##R##N#There has been a search over the last decade to resolve the complexity of this problem online and offline. Very recently, there has been substantial progress for the unweighted case - an O(1)-approximation algorithm and an O(log log k)-competitive randomized algorithm were given [6, 7]. These results resolve the complexity of the unweighted buffer problem, up to constant factors, since the problem is NP-Hard and there is a matching lower bound on the competitive ratio. However, the progress for the weighted case has not been as satisfactory as for the unweighted case.#R##N##R##N#Our main result is a randomized O(log log kγ)-approximation for the weighted case, which gives an exponential improvement over the previously best known result of O(√log k) which assumed γ = poly(k). Here γ is the ratio of the maximum to minimum weight. We also revisit the unweighted case and give an improved randomized 66.0823-approximation which improves (modestly) upon the approximation guarantee given in [6]. The algorithm and analysis we use for the unweighted case was done independently of [6]. We believe that our new interpretation of the problem and our analysis of an underlying random process could be of potential use in other settings."

This knowledge serves as a basis for developing better tools for human skill training and rehabilitation, exploring more effective methods of designing and controlling robotic hands, and creating more sophisticated human-computer interaction devices which use complex hand motions as control inputs. This paper presents work on the design, fabrication, and experimental validation of a soft sensor-embedded glove which measures both hand motion and contact pressures during human gesturing and manipulation tasks. We design an array of liquid-metal embedded elastomer sensors to measure up to hundreds of Newtons of interaction forces across the human palm during manipulation tasks and to measure skin strains across phalangeal and carpal joints for joint motion tracking. The elastomeric sensors provide the mechanical compliance necessary to accommodate anatomical variations and permit a normal range of hand motion. We explore methods of assembling this soft sensor glove from modular, individually fabricated pressure and strain sensors and develop design guidelines for their mechanical integration. Experimental validation of a soft finger glove prototype demonstrates the sensitivity range of the designed sensors and the mechanical robustness of the proposed assembly method, and provides a basis for the production of a complete soft sensor glove from inexpensive modular sensor components."
1229459,15514,23735,A relative-change-based hierarchical taxonomy for cantilever-snap assembly verification,2012,"Snap assembly automation remains a challenging task. While progress is being made in localization of parts, force controllers, and control strategies, little work has been done to help the robot reason about its current state, such that if necessary, the robot can assume corrective actions to accomplish the task. Error prone situations caused by the unexpected motion of parts, localization errors, jamming or wedging, cannot be solved by force controllers alone. For this reason we propose a snap assemblies verification system for cantilever-snap fasteners. The verification works in concert with a control strategy that makes use of constraint designs embedded in the snap parts' physical design. The constrained assembly motion generates similar sensory-signal patterns across trials that facilitates force signal discrimination into higher level abstractions of intuitive behavior. This work's contribution is the design of a hierarchical taxonomy for cantilever-snap verification based on increasingly abstract layers that encode relative-change in the task's force signatures. A five-layered taxonomy is built on the concept that relative-change patterns can be classified through a small category set and aided by contextual information. The verification system yielded human apropos intuitive categorizations of task behavior for every state and effectively determined the assembly result. This simple yet effective approach will be expanded to perform probabilistic online system verification to aid in fault tolerance and the automation of cantilever-based snap assemblies."

In practice, the mapping activities carried out by AUVs consist of flying either pre-programmed tracklines (most propeller-driven AUVs), or else reporting data to human operators at regular intervals that permit retasking (typical for month-long underwater glider deployments). AUVs equipped with the ability to reason about scientific objectives in real time could significantly increase the value of individual deployments by enabling sampling efforts to be focused on targets or areas identified autonomously or semi-autonomously as scientifically interesting [1]. In this paper, we focus on AUV autonomy as it pertains to water-column sensing and argue that the classification of water-column sensor data represents an important enabling capability. We demonstrate practical, semi-supervised classification of water-column sensor data using a particular Bayesian, non-parametric clustering method, the Variational Dirichlet Process, combined with operator-supplied semantic labeling. The method is applied to the detection of a deep subsea hydrocarbon plume using data collected by the Woods Hole Oceanographic's Sentry AUV during an expedition to the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon blowout disaster."
1059549,15514,23684,Subsampling mathematical relaxations and average-case complexity,2011,"We initiate a study of when the value of mathematical relaxations such as linear and semi-definite programs for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) is approximately preserved when restricting the instance to a sub-instance induced by a small random subsample of the variables.   Let  C  be a family of CSPs such as 3SAT, Max-Cut, etc., and let Π be a mathematical program that is a  relaxation  for  C , in the sense that for every instance  P  ∈  C , Π( P ) is a number in [0, 1] upper bounding the maximum fraction of satisfiable constraints of  P . Loosely speaking, we say that  subsampling holds  for  C  and Π if for every sufficiently dense instance  P  ∈  C  and every e > 0, if we let  P ' be the instance obtained by restricting  P  to a sufficiently large constant number of variables, then Π( P ') ∈ (1 ± e)Π( P ). We say that  weak subsampling  holds if the above guarantee is replaced with Π( P ') = 1 − θ(γ) whenever Π( P ) = 1 − γ, where θ hides only absolute constants. We obtain both positive and negative results, showing that:   1. Subsampling holds for the BasicLP and BasicSDP programs. BasicSDP is a variant of the semi-definite program considered by Raghavendra (2008), who showed it gives an optimal approximation factor for every constraint-satisfaction problem under the unique games conjecture. BasicLP is the linear programming analog of BasicSDP.   2. For tighter versions of BasicSDP obtained by adding additional constraints from the Lasserre hierarchy,  weak  subsampling holds for CSPs of unique games type.   3. There are non-unique CSPs for which even weak subsampling fails for the above tighter semi-definite programs. Also there are unique CSPs for which (even weak) subsampling fails for the Sherali-Adams  linear programming  hierarchy.   As a corollary of our weak subsampling for strong semi-definite programs, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm to certify that  random geometric graphs  (of the type considered by Feige and Schechtman, 2002) of max-cut value 1 − γ have a cut value at most 1 − γ/10. More generally, our results give an approach to obtaining average-case algorithms for CSPs using semi-definite programming hierarchies."
1554616,15514,8927,Scalable K-Means by ranked retrieval,2014,"The k-means clustering algorithm has a long history and a proven practical performance, however it does not scale to clustering millions of data points into thousands of clusters in high dimensional spaces. The main computational bottleneck is the need to recompute the nearest centroid for every data point at every iteration, aprohibitive cost when the number of clusters is large. In this paper we show how to reduce the cost of the k-means algorithm by large factors by adapting ranked retrieval techniques. Using a combination of heuristics, on two real life data sets the wall clock time per iteration is reduced from 445 minutes to less than 4, and from 705 minutes to 1.4, while the clustering quality remains within 0.5% of the k-means quality.   The key insight is to invert the process of point-to-centroid assignment by creating an inverted index over all the points and then using the current centroids as queries to this index to decide on cluster membership. In other words, rather than each iteration consisting of points picking centroids, each iteration now consists of centroids picking points. This is much more efficient, but comes at the cost of leaving some points unassigned to any centroid. We show experimentally that the number of such points is low and thus they can be separately assigned once the final centroids are decided. To speed up the computation we sparsify the centroids by pruning low weight features. Finally, to further reduce the running time and the number of unassigned points, we propose a variant of the WAND algorithm that uses the results of the intermediate results of nearest neighbor computations to improve performance."
1736545,15514,23735,Distributed algorithm design for multi-robot generalized task assignment problem,2013,"We present a provably-good distributed algorithm for generalized task assignment problem in the context of multirobot systems, where robots cooperate to complete a set of given tasks. In multi-robot generalized assignment problem (MR-GAP), each robot has its own resource constraint (e.g., energy constraint), and needs to consume a certain amount of resource to obtain a payoff for each task. The objective is to find a maximum payoff assignment of tasks to robots such that each task is assigned to at most one robot while respecting robots' resource constraints. MR-GAP is a NP-hard problem. It is an extension of multi-robot linear assignment problem since different robots can use different amount of resource for doing a task (due to the heterogeneity of robots and tasks). We first present an auction-based iterative algorithm for MR-GAP assuming the presence of a shared memory (or centralized auctioneer), where each robot uses a knapsack algorithm as a subroutine to iteratively maximize its own objective (using a modified payoff function based on an auxiliary variable, called price of a task). Our iterative algorithm can be viewed as (an approximation of) best response assignment update rule of each robot to the assignment of other robots at that iteration. We prove that our algorithm converges to an assignment (approximately) at equilibrium under the assignment update rule, with an approximation ratio of 1+α (where α is the approximation ratio for the Knapsack problem). We also combine our algorithm with a message passing mechanism to remove the requirement of a shared memory and make our algorithm totally distributed assuming the robots' communication network is connected. Finally, we present simulation results to depict our algorithm's performance."

In this work we focus on the k-colouring model} and the hard-core model with fugacity \lambda when the underlying graph is an instance of Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,p), where p=d/n and d is fixed. #R##N#We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for sampling from the aforementioned distributions. In particular, we consider Glauber (block) dynamics. We show a dramatic improvement on the bounds for rapid mixing in terms of the number of colours and the fugacity for the corresponding models. For both models the bounds we get are only within small constant factors from the conjectured ones by the statistical physicists. #R##N#We use Path Coupling to show rapid mixing. For k and \lambda in the range of our interest the technical challenge is to cope with the high degree vertices, i.e. vertices of degree much larger than the expected degree d. The usual approach to this problem is to consider block updates rather than single vertex updates for the Markov chain. Taking appropriately defined blocks the effect of high degree vertices somehow diminishes. However, devising such a construction of blocks is a highly non trivial task. #R##N#We develop for a first time a weighting schema for the paths of the underlying graph. Vertices which belong to light paths, only, can be placed at the boundaries of the blocks. Then the tree-like local structure of G(n,d/n) allows the construction of simple structured blocks."
2476021,15514,9969,Differential Privacy with Imperfect Randomness,2012,"In this work we revisit the question of basing cryptography on imperfect randomness. Bosley and Dodis TCC'07 showed that if a source of randomness $$\mathcal {R}$$ is good enough to generate a secret key capable of encrypting k bits, then one can deterministically extract nearly k almost uniform bits from $$\mathcal {R}$$, suggesting that traditional privacy notions namely, indistinguishability of encryption requires an extractable source of randomness. Other, even stronger impossibility results are known for achieving privacy under specific non-extractable sources of randomness, such as the $$\gamma $$-Santha-Vazirani SV source, where each next bit has fresh entropy, but is allowed to have a small bias $$\gamma < 1$$ possibly depending on prior bits.#R##N##R##N#We ask whether similar negative results also hold for a more recent notion of privacy called differential privacy Dwork et al., TCC'06, concentrating, in particular, on achieving differential privacy with the Santha-Vazirani source. We show that the answer is no. Specifically, we give a differentially private mechanism for approximating arbitrary low sensitivity functions that works even with randomness coming from a $$\gamma $$-Santha-Vazirani source, for any $$\gamma <1$$. This provides a somewhat surprising separation between traditional privacy and differential privacy with respect to imperfect randomness.#R##N##R##N#Interestingly, the design of our mechanism is quite different from the traditional additive-noise mechanisms e.g., Laplace mechanism successfully utilized to achieve differential privacy with perfect randomness. Indeed, we show that any non-trivial SV-robust mechanism for our problem requires a demanding property called consistent sampling, which is strictly stronger than differential privacy, and cannot be satisfied by any additive-noise mechanism."
1961492,15514,23634,Quadratic Goldreich-Levin Theorems,2011,"Decomposition theorems in classical Fourier analysis enable us to express a bounded function in terms of few linear phases with large Fourier coefficients plus a part that is pseudorandom with respect to linear phases. The Gold Reich-Levin algorithm can be viewed as an algorithmic analogue of such a decomposition as it gives a way to efficiently find the linear phases associated with large Fourier coefficients. In the study of & quot; quadratic Fourier analysis & quot;, higher-degree analogues of such decompositions have been developed in which the pseudorandomness property is stronger but the structured part correspondingly weaker. For example, it has previously been shown that it is possible to express a bounded function as a sum of a few quadratic phases plus a part that is small in the $U^3$ norm, defined by Gowers for the purpose of counting arithmetic progressions of length 4. We give a polynomial time algorithm for computing such a decomposition. A key part of the algorithm is a local self-correction procedure for Reed-Muller codes of order 2 (over $\F_2^n$) for a function at distance $1/2-\epsilon$ from a codeword. Given a function $f:\F_2^n \to \{-1,1\}$ at fractional Hamming distance $1/2-\epsilon$ from a quadratic phase (which is a codeword of Reed-Muller code of order 2), we give an algorithm that runs in time polynomial in $n$ and finds a codeword at distance at most $1/2-\eta$ for $\eta = \eta(\epsilon)$. This is an algorithmic analogue of Samorodnitsky's result, which gave a tester for the above problem. To our knowledge, it represents the first instance of a correction procedure for any class of codes, beyond the list-decoding radius. In the process, we give algorithmic versions of results from additive combinatorics used in Samorodnitsky's proof and a refined version of the inverse theorem for the Gowers $U^3$ norm over $\F_2^n$ or a function at distance 1/2 -- episilon from a codeword. Given a function f : $\F_2^n$ right arrow { -- 1, 1} at fractional Hamming distance 1/2 -- epsilon  from a quadratic phase (which is a codeword of Reed-Muller code of order 2), we give an algorithm that runs in time polynomial in n and finds a codeword at distance at most 1.2 -- n for n = n (epsilon). This is an algorithmic analogue of Samorodnitsky's result [17], which gave a tester for the above problem.

612530,15514,23684,Kernelization of packing problems,2012,"Kernelization algorithms are polynomial-time reductions from a problem to itself that guarantee their output to have a size not exceeding some bound. For example, d-Set Matching for integers d ≥ 3 is the problem of finding a matching of size at least k in a given d-uniform hypergraph and has kernels with O(kd) edges. Recently, Bodlaender et al. [ICALP 2008], Fortnow and Santhanam [STOC 2008], Dell and Van Melkebeek [STOC 2010] developed a framework for proving lower bounds on the kernel size for certain problems, under the complexity-theoretic hypothesis that coNP is not contained in NP/poly. Under the same hypothesis, we show lower bounds for the kernelization of d-Set Matching and other packing problems.#R##N##R##N#Our bounds are tight for d-Set Matching: It does not have kernels with O(kd−e) edges for any e > 0 unless the hypothesis fails. By reduction, this transfers to a bound of O(kd−1−e) for the problem of finding k vertex-disjoint cliques of size d in standard graphs. It is natural to ask for tight bounds on the kernel sizes of such graph packing problems. We make first progress in that direction by showing non-trivial kernels with O(k2.5) edges for the problem of finding k vertex-disjoint paths of three edges each. This does not quite match the best lower bound of O(k2−e) that we can prove.#R##N##R##N#Most of our lower bound proofs follow a general scheme that we discover: To exclude kernels of size O(kd−e) for a problem in d-uniform hypergraphs, one should reduce from a carefully chosen d-partite problem that is still NP-hard. As an illustration, we apply this scheme to the vertex cover problem, which allows us to replace the number-theoretical construction by Dell and Van Melkebeek [STOC 2010] with shorter elementary arguments."
1281788,15514,23735,Fast voxel maps with counting bloom filters,2012,"In order to achieve good and timely volumetric mapping for mobile robots, we improve the speed and accuracy of multi-resolution voxel map building from 3D data. Mobile robot capabilities, such as SLAM and path planning, often involve algorithms that query a map many times and this lookup is often the bottleneck limiting the execution speed. As such, fast spatial proximity queries has been the topic of much active research. Various data structures have been researched including octrees, k-d trees, approximate nearest neighbours and even dense 3D arrays. We tackle this problem by extending previous work that stores the map as a hash table containing occupied voxels at multiple resolutions. We apply Bloom filters to the problem of spatial querying and voxel maps for the example application of SLAM. Their efficacy is demonstrated building 3D maps with both simulated and real 3D point cloud data. Looking up whether a voxel is occupied is three times faster than the hash table and within 10% of the speed of querying a dense 3D array, potentially the upper limit to query speed. Map generation was done with scan to map alignment on simulated depth images, for which the true pose is available. The calculated poses exhibited sub-voxel error of 0.02m and 0.3 degrees for a typical indoor scene with a map resolution of 0.04m."
2670398,15514,23684,New approximability results for two-dimensional bin packing,2013,"We study the two-dimensional bin packing problem: Given a list of n rectangles the objective is to find a feasible, i.e. axis-parallel and non-overlapping, packing of all rectangles into the minimum number of unit sized squares, also called bins. Our problem consists of two versions; in the first version it is not allowed to rotate the rectangles while in the other it is allowed to rotate the rectangles by 90°, i.e. to exchange the widths and the heights.#R##N##R##N#Two-dimensional bin packing is a generalization of its one-dimensional counterpart and is therefore strongly NP-hard. Furthermore Bansal et al. [2] showed that even an APTAS is ruled out for this problem, unless P = NP. This lower bound of asymptotic approximability was improved by Chlebik & Chlebikova [4] to values 1 + 1/3792 and 1 + 1/2196 for the version with and without rotations, respectively. On the positive side there is an asymptotic 1.69.. approximation by Caprara [3] without rotations and an asymptotic 1.52... approximation by Bansal et al.

We cut a small vertical or horizontal strip out of each bin and move the intersecting rectangles into additional bins. This enables us to either round the widths of all wide rectangles, or the heights of all long rectangles in this bin. After this step we round the other, unrounded side of these rectangles and we achieve a solution with a simple structure and only few types of rectangles. Our algorithm initially rounds the instance and computes a solution that nearly matches the modified optimal solution."
1168483,15514,23634,Learning Sums of Independent Integer Random Variables,2013,"Let S = X 1 +···+X n  be a sum of n independent integer random variables X i , where each X i  is supported on {0, 1, ..., k - 1} but otherwise may have an arbitrary distribution (in particular the Xi's need not be identically distributed). How many samples are required to learn the distribution S to high accuracy? In this paper we show that the answer is completely independent of n, and moreover we give a computationally efficient algorithm which achieves this low sample complexity. More precisely, our algorithm learns any such S to e-accuracy (with respect to the total variation distance between distributions) using poly(k, 1/e) samples, independent of n. Its running time is poly(k, 1/e) in the standard word RAM model. Thus we give a broad generalization of the main result of [DDS12b] which gave a similar learning result for the special case k = 2 (when the distribution S is a Poisson Binomial Distribution). Prior to this work, no nontrivial results were known for learning these distributions even in the case k = 3. A key difficulty is that, in contrast to the case of k = 2, sums of independent {0, 1, 2}-valued random variables may behave very differently from (discretized) normal distributions, and in fact may be rather complicated - they are not log-concave, they can be Θ(n)-modal, there is no relationship between Kolmogorov distance and total variation distance for the class, etc. Nevertheless, the heart of our learning result is a new limit theorem which characterizes what the sum of an arbitrary number of arbitrary independent {0, 1, ... , k-1}-valued random variables may look like. Previous limit theorems in this setting made strong assumptions on the “shift invariance” of the random variables Xi in order to force a discretized normal limit. We believe that our new limit theorem, as the first result for truly arbitrary sums of independent {0, 1, ... , k-1}-valued random variables, is of independent interest."
1996650,15514,23634,The Graph Minor Algorithm with Parity Conditions,2011,"We generalize the seminal Graph Minor algorithm of Robertson and Seymour to the parity version. We give polynomial time algorithms for the following problems:\begin{enumerate}\itemthe parity $H$-minor (Odd $K_k$-minor) containment problem, and\itemthe disjoint paths problem with $k$ terminals and the parity condition for each path, \end{enumerate}as well as several other related problems. We present an $O(m \alpha(m,n) n)$ time algorithm for these problems for any fixed $k$, where $n,m$ are the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively, and the function $\alpha(m,n)$ is the inverse of the Ackermann function (see Tarjan \cite{tarjan}). Note that the first problem includes the problem of testing whether or not a given graph contains $k$ disjoint odd cycles (which was recently solved in \cite{tony, oddstoc}), if we fix $H$ to be equal to the graph of $k$ disjoint triangles. The algorithm for the second problem generalizes the Robertson Seymour algorithm for the $k$-disjoint paths problem. As with the Robertson-Seymour algorithm for the $k$-disjoint paths problem for any fixed $k$, in each iteration, we would like to either use the presence of a huge clique minor, or alternatively exploit the structure of graphs in which we cannot find such a minor. Here, however, we must maintain the parity of the paths and can only use an ``odd clique minor & quot;. This requires new techniques to describe the structure of the graph when we cannot find such a minor. We emphasize that our proof for the correctness of the above algorithms does not depend on the full power of the Graph Minor structure theorem \cite{RS16}. Although the original Graph Minor algorithm of Robertson and Seymour does depend on it and our proof does have similarities to their arguments, we can avoid the structure theorem by building on the shorter proof for the correctness of the graph minor algorithm in \cite{kw}. Consequently, we are able to avoid the much of the heavy machinery of the Graph Minor structure theory. Utilizing some results of \cite{kw} and \cite{lex1, lex2}, our proof is less than 50 pages."
742952,15514,23735,Nonlinear model predictive control of joint ankle by electrical stimulation for drop foot correction,2013,"In this paper we investigate the use of optimal control techniques to improve Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) for drop foot correction on hemiplegic patients. A model of the foot and the tibialis anterior muscle, the contraction of which is controlled by electrical stimulation has been established and is used in the optimal control problem. The novelty in this work is the use of the ankle accelerations and shank orientations (so-called external states) in the model, which have been measured on hemiplegic patients in a previous experiment using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The optimal control problem minimizes the square of muscle excitations which serves the overall goal of reducing energy consumption in the muscle. In a first step, an offline optimal control problem is solved for test purposes and shows the efficiency of the FES optimal control for drop foot correction. In a second step, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) problem - or online optimal control problem, is solved in a simulated environment. While the ulitmate goal is to use NMPC on the real system, i.e. directly on the patient, this test in simulation was meant to show the feasibility of NMPC for online drop foot correction. In the optimization problem, a set of fixed constraints of foot orientation was applied. Then, an original adaptive constraint taking into account the current ankle height, was introduced and tested. Comparisons between results under fixed and adaptive constraints highlight the advantage of the adaptive constraints in terms of energy consumption, where its quadratic sum of controls, obtained by NMPC, was three times lower than with the fixed constraint. This feasibility study was a first step in application of NMPC on real hemiplegic patients for online FES-based drop foot correction. The adaptive constraints method presents a new and efficient approach in terms of muscular energy consumption minimization."

We validate the technical feasibility and efficacy of our system in guiding, motivating, and administering an upper extremity rehabilitation task. The robot, which consists of a humanoid torso on a mobile base, monitors user performance on a wire puzzle task through a wearable inertial measurement unit and signals from the puzzle. Smoothness of stroke-affected limb movement is used as the evaluation metric. Five adults of mild to moderate functional ability in the chronic phase of stroke recovery interacted with our SAR system over three separate days. The inertial data from the five participants were analyzed using frequency domain techniques. Subsequently, the amount of power in frequency bands corresponding to voluntary (0.1 to 2Hz) and involuntary motion/jerk (4 to 8Hz) was evaluated. We found that, in adults of mild severity (Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores greater than 40), the motion becomes smoother (the amount of jerk is reduced) over 3 days of task practice. In adults of moderate motor severity (scores below 40), the motion became less smooth. This may indicate that the combination of our task and SAR system is better suited for individuals with higher functional ability, and needs augmentation in order to aid those of lower functional ability levels."
1867354,15514,20649,"Software Only, Extremely Compact, Keccak-based Secure PRNG on ARM Cortex-M",2014,"The ability to generate secure random numbers is fundamental to the security of cryptographic protocols. Random Number Generators (RNGs) start to appear in recent modern Intel CPUs as used in desktops and servers. Solutions for embedded devices, such as e.g. sensor nodes and wireless routers, are still severely lacking however.   In this paper we present the implementation of a secure pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) for the ARM Cortex-M microcontroller family, one of the most popular embedded platforms at this moment. For compactness and compatibility reasons, our implementation is software only. It uses the start-up values of on-chip SRAM as random seed and uses the Keccak hash function for both entropy extraction as well as pseudo-random number generation.   Getting Keccak very compact in terms of memory requirements is therefore essential. Keccak is a tunable algorithm: in this paper we discuss the minimum security requirements and the storage costs as a function of the Keccak variant.   The Keccak permutation of our choice, Keccak-f [200], is implemented in only 400 bytes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the smallest Keccak implementation published so far. With the addition of initialization, hashing, padding and output generation functions, our complete solution fits within 496 bytes of ROM and requires 52 bytes of RAM. One byte of pseudo-random data, with a security level of at least 128 bits, can be generated in 3337 cyles on an ARM Cortex-M3/4, i.e. 50KiB/s on a development board, plenty fast for a cryptographic PRNG in an embedded setting."
2259804,15514,23735,Perturbation theory to plan dynamic locomotion in very rough terrains,2011,"Although the problem of dynamic locomotion in very rough terrain is critical to the advancement of various areas in robotics and health devices, little progress has been made on generalizing gait behavior with arbitrary paths. Here, we report that perturbation theory, a set of approximation schemes that has roots in celestial mechanics and non-linear dynamical systems, can be adapted to predict the behavior of non-integrable state-space trajectories of a robot's center of mass, given its arbitrary contact state and center of mass (CoM) kinematic path. Given an arbitrary kinematic path of the CoM and known step locations, we use perturbation theory to determine phase curves of CoM behavior. We determine step transitions as the points of intersection between adjacent phase curves. To discover intersection points, we fit polynomials to the phase curves of neighboring steps and solve their differential roots. The resulting multi-step phase diagram is the locomotion plan suited to drive the behavior of a robot or device maneuvering in the rough terrain. We provide two main contributions to legged locomotion: (1) predicting CoM state-space behavior for arbitrary paths by means of perturbation theory, and (2) finding step transitions by locating common intersection points between neighboring phase curves. Because these points are continuous in phase they correspond to the desired contact switching policy. We validate our results on a human-size avatar navigating in a very rough environment and compare its behavior to a human subject maneuvering through the same terrain."
1598065,15514,8235,Contract & Expand: I/O Efficient SCCs Computing,2014,"As an important branch of big data processing, big graph processing is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. Strongly connected component (SCC) computation is a fundamental graph operation on directed graphs, where an SCC is a maximal subgraph S of a directed graph G in which every pair of nodes is reachable from each other in S. By contracting each SCC into a node, a large general directed graph can be represented by a small directed acyclic graph (DAG). In the literature, there are I/O efficient semi-external algorithms to compute all SCCs of a graph G, by assuming that all nodes of a graph G can fit in the main memory. However, many real graphs are large and even the nodes cannot reside entirely in the main memory. In this paper, we study new I/O efficient external algorithms to find all SCCs for a directed graph G whose nodes cannot fit entirely in the main memory. To overcome the deficiency of the existing external graph contraction based approach that usually cannot stop in finite iterations, and the external DFS based approach that will generate a large number of random I/Os, we explore a new contraction-expansion based approach. In the graph contraction phase, instead of contracting the whole graph as the contraction based approach, we only contract the nodes of a graph, which are much more selective. The contraction phase stops when all nodes of the graph can fit in the main memory, such that the semi-external algorithm can be used in SCC computation. In the graph expansion phase, as the graph is expanded in the reverse order as it is contracted, the SCCs of all nodes in the graph are computed. Both graph contraction phase and graph expansion phase use only I/O efficient sequential scans and external sorts of nodes/edges in the graph. Our algorithm leverages the efficiency of the semi-external SCC computation algorithm and usually stops in a small number of iterations. We further optimize our approach by reducing the size of nodes and edges of the contracted graph in each iteration. We conduct extensive experimental studies using both real and synthetic web-scale graphs to confirm the I/O efficiency of our approaches."

Equivalently, if we are given two sets of n vectors each in Rd+1, is there a pair of vectors (one from each set) that are orthogonal? This problem has a long history and a multitude of applications. It is widely believed that for large d, the problem is subject to the curse of dimensionality: all known algorithms need at least f(d) · n2-1/O(d) time for fast-growing functions f, and at the present time there is little hope that a n2-e · poly(d) time algorithm will be found.#R##N##R##N#We consider Hopcroft's problem over finite fields and integers modulo composites, leading to both surprising algorithms and hardness reductions.

We show the randomized communication complexity of the problem is closely related to the sizes of matching vector families, which have been studied in the design of locally decodable codes. Letting HOPCROFTR denote Hopcroft's problem over a ring R, we give randomized algorithms and almost matching lower bounds (modulo a breakthrough in SAT algorithms) for HOPCROFTR, when R is the ring of integers modulo m or a finite field.#R##N##R##N#Building on the ideas developed here, we give a very simple and efficient output-sensitive algorithm for matrix multiplication that works over any field."
1769758,15514,23735,Market-based coordination of coupled robot systems,2011,"Tasks such as street mapping and security surveillance seek a route that traverses a given space to perform a function. These task functions may involve mapping the space for accurate modeling, sensing the space for unusual activity, or searching the space for an object. In many cases, the use of multiple robots can greatly improve the performance of these tasks. We assume a prior map is available, but it may be inaccurate due to factors such as occlusion, age, dynamic objects, and resolution limitations. In this work, we address the NP-hard problem of environmental coverage with incomplete prior map information using multiple robots. To utilize related algorithms in graph theory, we represent the environment as a graph and model the coverage problem as a k-Rural Postman Problem where k represents the number of robots. Using this representation, the problem can be solved using a branch-and-bound approach to find an optimal route, and a route division heuristic to separate the route into k pieces. Since the branch-and-bound technique is exponential time, we present an approach to decompose the search problem into subtasks that are distributed among the robots. Using ideas from market-based approaches, we allow the robots to auction particular sections of the problem space to other robots as a way to more evenly divide the work and focus the search. Finally, we evaluate these methods on test graphs in simulation."

Our focus is on token-forwarding algorithms, which do not manipulate tokens in any way other than storing, copying and forwarding them.#R##N##R##N#We first consider the strongly adaptive adversary model where in each round, each node first chooses a token to broadcast to all its neighbors (without knowing who they are), and then an adversary chooses an arbitrary connected communication network for that round with the knowledge of the tokens chosen by each node.

The bound applies to a wide class of initial token distributions, including those in which each token is held by exactly one node and well-mixed ones in which each node has each token independently with a constant probability.#R##N##R##N#Our result for the strongly adaptive adversary model motivates us to study the weakly adaptive adversary model where in each round, the adversary is required to lay down the network first, and then each node sends a possibly distinct token to each of its neighbors. We propose a simple randomized distributed algorithm where in each round, along every edge (u, v), a token sampled uniformly at random from the symmetric difference of the sets of tokens held by node u and node v is exchanged. We prove that starting from any well-mixed distribution of tokens where each node has each token independently with a constant probability, this algorithm solves the k-gossip problem in O((n + k) log n log k) rounds with high probability over the initial token distribution and the randomness of the protocol. We then show how the above uniform sampling problem can be solved using O(log n) bits of communication, making the overall algorithm communication-efficient.#R##N##R##N#We next present a centralized algorithm that solves the gossip problem for every initial distribution in O((n + k) log2 n) rounds in the offline setting where the entire sequence of communication networks is known to the algorithm in advance. Finally, we present an O(n min{k, √k log n})-round centralized offline algorithm in which each node can only broadcast a single token to all of its neighbors in each round."
1828724,15514,8960,Nearest Neighbor based Greedy Coordinate Descent,2011,"Increasingly, optimization problems in machine learning, especially those arising from high-dimensional statistical estimation, have a large number of variables. Modern statistical estimators developed over the past decade have statistical or sample complexity that depends only weakly on the number of parameters when there is some structure to the problem, such as sparsity. A central question is whether similar advances can be made in their computational complexity as well. In this paper, we propose strategies that indicate that such advances can indeed be made. In particular, we investigate the greedy coordinate descent algorithm, and note that performing the greedy step efficiently weakens the costly dependence on the problem size provided the solution is sparse. We then propose a suite of methods that perform these greedy steps efficiently by a reduction to nearest neighbor search. We also devise a more amenable form of greedy descent for composite non-smooth objectives; as well as several approximate variants of such greedy descent. We develop a practical implementation of our algorithm that combines greedy coordinate descent with locality sensitive hashing. Without tuning the latter data structure, we are not only able to significantly speed up the vanilla greedy method, but also outperform cyclic descent when the problem size becomes large. Our results indicate the effectiveness of our nearest neighbor strategies, and also point to many open questions regarding the development of computational geometric techniques tailored towards first-order optimization methods."
1971239,15514,23684,Metastability of logit dynamics for coordination games,2012,"Logit Dynamics [Blume, Games and Economic Behavior, 1993] is a randomized best response dynamics for strategic games: at every time step a player is selected uniformly at random and she chooses a new strategy according to a probability distribution biased toward strategies promising higher payoffs. This process defines an ergodic Markov chain, over the set of strategy profiles of the game, whose unique stationary distribution is the long-term equilibrium concept for the game. However, when the mixing time of the chain is large (e.g., exponential in the number of players), the stationary distribution loses its appeal as equilibrium concept, and the transient phase of the Markov chain becomes important. In several cases it happens that on a time-scale shorter than mixing time the chain is quasi-stationary, meaning that it stays close to some small set of the state space, while in a time-scale multiple of the mixing time it jumps from one quasi-stationary configuration to another; this phenomenon is usually called metastability.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we give a quantitative definition of metastable probability distributions for a Markov chain and we study the metastability of the Logit dynamics for some classes of coordination games. In particular, we study no-risk-dominant coordination games on the clique (which is equivalent to the well-known Glauber dynamics for the Ising model) and coordination games on a ring (both the risk-dominant and no-risk-dominant case). We also describe a simple artificial game that highlights the distinctive features of our metastability notion based on distributions."
933373,15514,23735,Experimental investigation of surface identification ability of a low-profile fabric tactile sensor,2012,"Humans usually distinguish objects by sliding their fingertips on the surface to feel the texture via mechanoreceptor underneath the skin. We have developed a human-imitated system for robotic fingertip to sense object's texture via sliding action. Design of the sensory skin was inspired by the localized displacement phenomenon of a sliding soft fingertip ([1]) to capture stick-slip events on the contact surface that mainly represent texture characteristics. The soft skin is knitted by electro-conductive tension-sensitive yarns, then covered over a hemispherical fingertip. The pile-shaped surface of the fabric sensor enhances tangential traction detection ability of the sensor, even though the normal load is also sensible. Our aim is to exploit this sensor in applications regarding relative sliding between the touched object and the surface of the sensor, such as slip detection ([2]), and surface identification in this paper. In surface encoding, we have experimentally investigated ability of the fabric sensor in recognition touched objects via multiple machine learning algorithms, such as naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with input extracted from autoregressive models, and ANN with input extracted from Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), have been trained to distinguish three typical textures. As a result, we have found that the last method outperforms the remains with an average successful rate of 90%."
1780141,15514,23735,Remote microscale teleoperation through virtual reality and haptic feedback,2011,"This paper reports the remote handling of microscale objects, between two sites approximately 630 km distant. To manipulate objects less than 10 µm, specific equipments such as AFM (Atomic Force Microscope) cantilevers integrated into a SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) are generally required. Enabling remote access to such a system would benefit any micro/nanoresearcher. However, vision feedback and sensor data of a micromanipulation system are generally limited, hence the implementation of a teleoperation scenario is not straightforward. Specific tools are proposed here for an intuitive manipulation in a wide range of applications. To ensure ease of manipulation, both a 3D virtual representation of the scene and haptic feedback are provided. Force sensor feedback is limited since only two measures are available. In order to extend this information, vision algorithms are developed to estimate the respective positions of the tool and objects, which are then used to calculate the haptic feedback. The stability of the overall scheme is very sensitive to time delays. This requirement is taken into account in vision algorithms and the communication module which transfers the data between the two remote sites. In addition, the proposed robotic control architecture is modular so that the platform can be used for a wide range of applications. First results are obtained on a teleoperation between Paris, France, and Oldenburg, Germany."
982840,15514,22288,A Latency-Aware Co-deployment Mechanism for Cloud-Based Services,2012,"Cloud computing attracts considerable attention from both industry and academic these years. Nowadays, a number of research investigations have been conducted on cloud-based services (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, etc.). Deployment of cloud-based services is one of the most important research problems. In cloud computing, multiple services tend to cooperate with each other to accomplish complicated tasks. Deploying these services independently may not lead to good overall performance, since there are a lot of interactions among different services. Making an optimal co-deployment of multiple services is critical for reducing latency of user requests. When deploying highly related services, taking only distribution of users into consideration is not enough, since the deployment of one service would affect others. To attack this challenge, we employ cross service information as well as user locations to build a new model in integer programming formulation. To reduce the computation time of the model, we purpose a sequential model running iteratively to obtain approximate solution. Extensive experiments have been conducted over a large real-world dataset, involving 307 distributed computers in about 40 countries, and 1881 real-world Internet-based services in about 60 countries. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model. Our real-world dataset is publicly released to promote future research, which also makes our experiments reproducible."
1590308,15514,23735,On robot dynamic model identification through sub-workspace evolved trajectories for optimal torque estimation,2013,"Model-based control are affected by the accuracy of dynamic calibration. For industrial robots, identification techniques predominantly involve rigid body models linearized on a set of minimal lumped parameters that are estimated along excitatory trajectories made by suitable/optimal path. Although the physical meaning of the estimated lumped models is often lost (e.g. negative inertia values), these methodologies get remarkably results when well-conditioned trajectories are applied. Nonetheless, such trajectories have usually to span the workspace at large, resulting in an averagely fitting model. In many technological tasks, instead, the region of dynamics applications is limited, and generation of trajectories in such workspace sub-region results in different specialized models that should increase the predictability of local behavior. Besides this consideration, the paper presents a genetic-based selection of trajectories in constrained sub-region. The methodology places under optimization paths generated by a commercial industrial robot interpolator, and the genes (i.e. the degrees-of-freedom) of the evolutionary algorithms corresponds to a finite set of few via-points and velocities, just like standard motion programming of industrial robots. Remarkably, experiments demonstrate that this algorithm design feature allows a good matching of foreseen current and the actual measured in different task conditions."
923449,15514,23634,Matching with Our Eyes Closed,2012,"Motivated by an application in kidney exchange, we study the following query-commit problem: we are given the set of vertices of a non-bipartite graph G. The set of edges in this graph are not known ahead of time. We can query any pair of vertices to determine if they are adjacent. If the queried edge exists, we are committed to match the two endpoints. Our objective is to maximize the size of the matching. This restriction in the amount of information available to the algorithm constraints us to implement myopic, greedy-like algorithms. A simple deterministic greedy algorithm achieves a factor 1/2 which is tight for deterministic algorithms. An important open question in this direction is to give a randomized greedy algorithm that has a significantly better approximation factor. This question was first asked almost 20 years ago by Dyer and Frieze [9] where they showed that a natural randomized strategy of picking edges uniformly at random doesn't help and has an approximation factor of 1/2 + o(1). They left it as an open question to devise a better randomized greedy algorithm. In subsequent work, Aronson, Dyer, Frieze, and Suen [2] gave a different randomized greedy algorithm and showed that it attains a factor 0.5 + o where o is 0.0000025. In this paper we propose and analyze a new randomized greedy algorithm for finding a large matching in a general graph and use it to solve the query commit problem mentioned above. We show that our algorithm attains a factor of at least 0.56, a significant improvement over 0.50000025. We also show that no randomized algorithm can have an approximation factor better than 0.7916 for the query commit problem. For another large and interesting class of randomized algorithms that we call vertex-iterative algorithms, we show that no vertex iterative algorithm can have an approximation factor better than 0.75."
896973,15514,23634,Streaming Algorithms via Precision Sampling,2011,"A technique introduced by Indyk and Woodruff (STOC 2005) has inspired several recent advances in data-stream algorithms. We show that a number of these results follow easily from the application of a single probabilistic method called Precision Sampling. Using this method, we obtain simple data-stream algorithms that maintain a randomized sketch of an input vector $x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$, which is useful for the following applications:* Estimating the $F_k$-moment of $x$, for $k>2$.* Estimating the $\ell_p$-norm of $x$, for $p\in[1,2]$, with small update time.* Estimating cascaded norms $\ell_p(\ell_q)$ for all $p,q>0$.* $\ell_1$ sampling, where the goal is to produce an element $i$ with probability (approximately) $|x_i|/\|x\|_1$. It extends to similarly defined $\ell_p$-sampling, for $p\in [1,2]$. For all these applications the algorithm is essentially the same: scale the vector $x$ entry-wise by a well-chosen random vector, and run a heavy-hitter estimation algorithm on the resulting vector. Our sketch is a linear function of $x$, thereby allowing general updates to the vector $x$. Precision Sampling itself addresses the problem of estimating a sum $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ from weak estimates of each real $a_i\in[0,1]$. More precisely, the estimator first chooses a desired precision$u_i\in(0,1]$ for each $i\in[n]$, and then it receives an estimate of every $a_i$ within additive $u_i$. Its goal is to provide a good approximation to $\sum a_i$ while keeping a tab on the ``approximation cost'' $\sum_i (1/u_i)$. Here we refine previous work (Andoni, Krauthgamer, and Onak, FOCS 2010)which shows that as long as $\sum a_i=\Omega(1)$, a good multiplicative approximation can be achieved using total precision of only $O(n\log n)$."
123003,15514,23684,Black-box reductions for cost-sharing mechanism design,2012,"We consider the design of strategyproof cost-sharing mechanisms. We give two simple, but extremely versatile, black-box reductions, that in combination reduce the cost-sharing mechanism-design problem to the algorithmic problem of finding a minimum-cost solution for a set of players. Our first reduction shows that any truthful, α-approximation mechanism for the social-cost minimization (SCM) problem satisfying a technical no-bossiness condition can be morphed into a truthful mechanism that achieves an O(α log n)-approximation where the prices recover the cost incurred. Thus, we decouple the task of truthfully computing an outcome with near-optimal social cost from the cost-sharing problem. This is fruitful since truthful mechanism-design, especially for single-dimensional problems, is a relatively well-understood and manageable task. Our second reduction nicely complements the first one by showing that any LP-based ρ-approximation for the problem of finding a min-cost solution for a set of players yields a truthful, no-bossy, (ρ + 1)-approximation for the SCM problem (and hence, a truthful (ρ + 1)log n-approximation cost-sharing mechanism).#R##N##R##N#These reductions find a slew of applications, yielding, as corollaries, the first or improved polytime cost-sharing mechanisms for a variety of problems. For example, our first reduction coupled with the celebrated VCG mechanism shows that for any cost-sharing problem (with a monotone cost function) one can obtain a truthful mechanism that achieves an O(log n)-approximation where the prices recover the cost incurred. Other applications include O(log n)-approximation mechanisms for: survivable network design problems, facility location (FL) problems including capacitated and connected FL problems, and minimum-makespan scheduling on unrelated machines. Our results demonstrate that in contrast with our current understanding of group-strategyproof and acyclic mechanisms, strategyproofness allows for ample flexibility in cost-sharing mechanism design enabling one to effectively leverage various algorithmic results."
963193,15514,23735,A novel time optimal path following controller with bounded velocities for mobile robots with independently steerable wheels,2013,"Mobile robots with independently steerable wheels possess many high maneuverability features of omnidirectional robots while benefiting from better performance and capability of moving on rough terrains. However, motion control of such robots is a challenging task due to presence of singular configurations and unboundedly large steering velocities in the neighborhood of those singularities. Many proposed approaches rely on numerical solutions that keep the robot out of bulky regions around the singular points and hence lose some of the robot maneuverability. Based on a class of traditional path followers we design a new globally stable path following controller that exploits the high maneuverability of the platform. This design allows us to derive a set of closed-form analytical functions that describe the robot base velocity as a function of the wheels driving and steering velocities while abide to the robot non-holonomic constraints. Those functions are then utilized to find the maximum instantaneous velocity of the body that keeps the wheels velocities under the pre-specified bounds no matter how much the robot gets close or far from its singular configurations. The control algorithms developed in this paper have been evaluated on iMoro, a four wheel independently steered mobile manipulator designed and developed at IHA/TUT. Experimental data is also shown that show efficacy of the method."
932437,15514,23735,Terminal sliding-mode based force tracking control of piezoelectric actuators for variable physical damping system,2014,"The need for safe human-robot interaction in emerging robotic applications has recently driven the develop- ment of new range of actuation systems spanning from variable stiffness drives to variable damping or full variable impedance joints. Concerning the provision of variable physical damping in compliant actuators, the main objective is to improve the control of compliant joint. In a particular class of these variable physical damping actuators (VPDAs), the level of generated damping is realized by creating a friction force which is actively controlled by piezoelectric actuators (PEAs). Therefore, to effectively control the damping output, the accurate force control of the PEAs is required. However, difficulties to precisely control the generated piezoelectric force stem from its highly nonlinear behavior such as hysteresis and creep effect. This paper presents a novel practical force tracking controller for PEAs with unknown hysteresis behavior. The proposed control consists of two elements: terminal sliding-mode based desired dynamics injection and model-free compensation for nonlinear dynamics of PEAs, which allow fast convergence and extraordinary robustness to the closed-loop system. The stability of the overall system is proved in the sense of Lyapunov. On the real prototype of VPDA, the proposed control scheme is experimentally verified and analyzed by comparison to other controllers, demonstrating improved force tracking performance of PEAs in VPDA system."
1919733,15514,23684,Towards robust and efficient computation in dynamic peer-to-peer networks,2012,"Motivated by the need for robust and fast distributed computation in highly dynamic Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, we study algorithms for the fundamental distributed agreement problem. P2P networks are highly dynamic networks that experience heavy node churn (i.e., nodes join and leave the network continuously over time). Our goal is to design fast algorithms (running in a small number of rounds) that guarantee, despite high node churn rate, that almost all nodes reach a stable agreement. Our main contributions are randomized distributed algorithms that guarantee stable almost-everywhere agreement with high probability even under high adversarial churn in a polylogarithmic number of rounds. In particular, we present the following results:#R##N##R##N#1. An O(log2 n)-round (n is the stable network size) randomized algorithm that achieves almost-everywhere agreement with high probability under up to linear churn per round (i.e., en, for some small constant e > 0), assuming that the churn is controlled by an oblivious adversary (that has complete knowledge and control of what nodes join and leave and at what time and has unlimited computational power, but is oblivious to the random choices made by the algorithm).#R##N##R##N#2. An O(log m log3 n)-round randomized algorithm that achieves almost-everywhere agreement with high probability under up to e√n churn per round (for some small e > 0), where m is the size of the input value domain, that works even under an adaptive adversary (that also knows the past random choices made by the algorithm).#R##N##R##N#Our algorithms are the first-known, fully-distributed, agreement algorithms that work under highly dynamic settings (i.e., high churn rates per step). Furthermore, they are localized (i.e., do not require any global topological knowledge), simple, and easy to implement. These algorithms can serve as building blocks for implementing other non-trivial distributed computing tasks in dynamic P2P networks."
2700657,15514,23684,An almost optimal algorithm for computing nonnegative rank,2013,"@. This is the first exact algorithm that runs in time singly-exponential in r. This algorithm (and earlier algorithms) are built on methods for finding a solution to a system of polynomial inequalities (if one exists). Notably, the best algorithms for this task run in time exponential in the number of variables but polynomial in all of the other parameters (the number of inequalities and the maximum degree).#R##N##R##N#Hence these algorithms motivate natural algebraic questions whose solution have immediate algorithmic implications: How many variables do we need to represent the decision problem, does M have nonnegative rank at most r? A naive formulation uses nr + mr variables and yields an algorithm that is exponential in n and m even for constant r. (Arora, Ge, Kannan, Moitra, STOC 2012) [1] recently reduced the number of variables to 2r22r, and here we exponentially reduce the number of variables to 2r2 and this yields our main algorithm. In fact, the algorithm that we obtain is nearly-optimal (under the Exponential Time Hypothesis) since an algorithm that runs in time (nm)o(r) would yield a subexponential algorithm for 3-SAT [1].#R##N##R##N#Our main result is based on establishing a normal form for nonnegative matrix factorization -- which in turn allows us to exploit algebraic dependence among a large collection of linear transformations with variable entries. Additionally, we also demonstrate that nonnegative rank cannot be certified by even a very large submatrix of M, and this property also follows from the intuition gained from viewing nonnegative rank through the lens of systems of polynomial inequalities."
190273,15514,20332,STREETS: game-theoretic traffic patrolling with exploration and exploitation,2014,"To dissuade reckless driving and mitigate accidents, cities deploy resources to patrol roads. In this paper, we present STREETS, an application developed for the city of Singapore, which models the problem of computing randomized traffic patrol strategies as a defender-attacker Stackelberg game. Previous work on Stackelberg security games has focused extensively on counterterrorism settings. STREETS moves beyond counterterrorism and represents the first use of Stackelberg games for traffic patrolling, in the process providing a novel algorithm for solving such games that addresses three major challenges in modeling and scale-up. First, there exists a high degree of unpredictability in travel times through road networks, which we capture using a Markov Decision Process for planning the patrols of the defender (the police) in the game. Second, modeling all possible police patrols and their interactions with a large number of adversaries (drivers) introduces a significant scalability challenge. To address this challenge we apply a compact game representation in a novel fashion combined with adversary and state sampling. Third, patrol strategies must balance exploitation (minimizing violations) with exploration (maximizing omnipresence), a tradeoff we model by solving a biobjective optimization problem. We present experimental results using real-world traffic data from Singapore. This work is done in collaboration with the Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs and is currently being evaluated by the Singapore Police Force."
2283853,15514,23735,Bathymetric SLAM with no map overlap using Gaussian Processes,2011,"This paper presents an efficient and featureless approach to Bathymetric Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) that utilizes a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) and Gaussian Process (GP) Regression to provide loop closures in areas where little to no overlap with previously explored terrain is present. To significantly reduce the memory requirements of this approach (thereby allowing for the processing of large datasets) a novel map representation is also introduced that, instead of directly storing estimates of seabed depth, records the trajectory of each particle and synchronizes them to a common log of bathymetric observations. Upon detecting a loop closure each particle is then weighted by matching new observations to the current predictions generated from a local reconstruction of their map using GP Regression. Here the spatial correlation in the environment is fully exploited, allowing predictions of seabed depth to be generated in areas that may not have been directly observed previously. The particle resampling that is performed therefore not only enforces self-consistency in overlapping sections of the map but additionally enforces self-consistency between neighboring map borders. The results demonstrate how observations of seafloor structure with partial overlap can be used by bathymetric SLAM to improve map self consistency when compared to Dead Reckoning fused with Long-Baseline observations. In addition we show how mapping corrections can still be achieved even when no map overlap is present."
1982772,15514,23735,Fast and adaptive auto-focusing algorithm for microscopic cell observation,2011,"In biological and medical sciences, optical microscopes are widely used. By using the microscope, we can observe cellular dynamics including intracellular ions and molecules tagged with fluorescent dyes at a high magnification. However, a freely motile cell easily escapes from a field of view and a focal plane of the typical microscope. Therefore, we propose a novel auto-focusing (AF) algorithm and develop an AF and tracking microscope. XYZ positions of a microscopic stage are visual feedback controlled to focus and track the cell automatically. A bright-field image is used to estimate a cellular position. XY centroids are used to estimate XY positions of the tracked cell. To estimate a Z position, we use a diffraction pattern around the cell membrane. This estimation method is so-called Depth from Diffraction (DFDi). However, this method is not robust for individual differences between cells because the diffraction pattern depends on each cellular shape, reflective index and transparency. Therefore, in this study, we propose a real-time correction of DFDi by using 2D Laplacian of a center region of the cell as a goodness of the focus. To evaluate the performance of our developed algorithm and microscope, we auto-focus and track a freely moving paramecium. In this experimental result, the paramecium is auto-focused and kept inside the scope of the microscope during 45s. The evaluated focal error is within 5[µm], while a length and a thickness of the paramecium are about 200[µm] and 50[µm], respectively."
2033799,15514,22021,One packet suffices - Highly efficient packetized Network Coding With finite memory,2011,"Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) has emerged as a powerful tool for robust high-throughput multicast. Projection analysis, a recently introduced technique, shows that the distributed packetized RLNC protocol achieves (order) optimal and perfectly pipelined information dissemination in many settings. In the original approach to RNLC intermediate nodes code together all available information. This requires intermediate nodes to keep considerable data available for coding. Moreover, it results in a coding complexity that grows linearly with the size of this data. While this has been identified as a problem, approaches that combine queuing theory and network coding have heretofore not provided a succinct representation of the memory needs of network coding at intermediates nodes. This paper shows the surprising result that, in all settings with a continuous stream of data, network coding continues to perform optimally even if only one packet per node is kept in active memory and used for computations. This leads to an extremely simple RLNC protocol variant with drastically reduced requirements on computational and memory resources. By extending the projection analysis, we show that in all settings in which the RLNC protocol was proven to be optimal its finite memory variant performs equally well. In the same way as the original projection analysis, our technique applies in a wide variety of network models, including highly dynamic topologies that can change completely at any time in an adversarial fashion."
1991197,15514,23735,Contactless deflection sensor for soft robots,2011,"In the emerging field of soft robotics, there is an interest in developing new kinds of sensors whose characteristics do not affect the intrinsic compliance of soft robot components. Additionally, non-invasive shape and deflection sensors may provoke improved solutions to assist in the control of mechanical parts in these robots. Herein, we introduce a novel method for deflection sensing where an LED element and a photodiode are placed on to two substrates connected physically or virtually at a deflection point. The deflection angle between the two planes can be extracted from the LED light intensity detected at the photodiode due to the bell-shaped angular intensity profile of the emitted light. The main advantage of this system is that the components are not in physical contact with the deflection region as in the case of strain gauges and similar sensing methods. The sensor is characterized in a range of deflections of 105–180 degrees, showing a near 1 degree resolution. The experimental data are compared to simulations, modeled by ray tracing. The light intensity vs. deflection angle measurements in our setup display a maximum difference of 9% and an average difference of approximately 5% with respect to the model. Finally, a shape monitoring system has been developed using the proposed concept for a flexible PCB. The system is composed of 12 deflection sensors that operate at frame rate of 33 Hz. This device could be applied to monitor the body shape of a soft robot."
2500641,15514,11052,Real-time compressive tracking,2012,"It is a challenging task to develop effective and efficient appearance models for robust object tracking due to factors such as pose variation, illumination change, occlusion, and motion blur. Existing online tracking algorithms often update models with samples from observations in recent frames. While much success has been demonstrated, numerous issues remain to be addressed. First, while these adaptive appearance models are data-dependent, there does not exist sufficient amount of data for online algorithms to learn at the outset. Second, online tracking algorithms often encounter the drift problems. As a result of self-taught learning, these mis-aligned samples are likely to be added and degrade the appearance models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective and efficient tracking algorithm with an appearance model based on features extracted from the multi-scale image feature space with data-independent basis. Our appearance model employs non-adaptive random projections that preserve the structure of the image feature space of objects. A very sparse measurement matrix is adopted to efficiently extract the features for the appearance model. We compress samples of foreground targets and the background using the same sparse measurement matrix. The tracking task is formulated as a binary classification via a naive Bayes classifier with online update in the compressed domain. The proposed compressive tracking algorithm runs in real-time and performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on challenging sequences in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness."
2393784,15514,9244,Distributed approximate spectral clustering for large-scale datasets,2012,"Data-intensive applications are becoming important in many science and engineering fields, because of the high rates in which data are being generated and the numerous opportunities offered by the sheer amount of these data. Large-scale datasets, however, are challenging to process using many of the current machine learning algorithms due to their high time and space complexities. In this paper, we propose a novel approximation algorithm that enables kernel-based machine learning algorithms to efficiently process very large-scale datasets. While important in many applications, current kernel-based algorithms suffer from a scalability problem as they require computing a kernel matrix which takes  O ( N  2 ) in time and space to compute and store. The proposed algorithm yields substantial reduction in computation and memory overhead required to compute the kernel matrix, and it does not significantly impact the accuracy of the results. In addition, the level of approximation can be controlled to tradeoff some accuracy of the results with the required computing resources. The algorithm is designed such that it is independent of the subsequently used kernel-based machine learning algorithm, and thus can be used with many of them. To illustrate the effect of the approximation algorithm, we developed a variant of the spectral clustering algorithm on top of it. Furthermore, we present the design of a MapReduce-based implementation of the proposed algorithm. We have implemented this design and run it on our own Hadoop cluster as well as on the Amazon Elastic MapReduce service. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that significant time and memory savings can be achieved using our algorithm."
2361448,15514,23735,Wheelchair navigation assisted by Human-Machine shared-control and a P300-based Brain Computer Interface,2011,"This paper presents a new shared-control approach for assistive mobile robots, using Brain Computer Interface (BCI) as the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). A P300-based paradigm that allows the selection of brain-actuated commands to steer a Robotic Wheelchair (RW), is proposed. At least one specific motor skill, such as the control of arms, legs, head or voice, is required to operate a conventional HMI. Due to this reason, they are not suited for people suffering from severe motor disorders. BCI may open a new communication channel to these users, since it does not require any muscular activity. The number of decoded symbols per minute (SPM) in a BCI is still very low, which means that users can only provide sparse, and discrete commands. The RW must rely on the navigation system to validate user commands effectively. A two-layer shared-control approach is proposed. The first, a virtual-constraint layer, is responsible for enabling/disabling the user commands, based on certain context restrictions. The second layer is an user-intent matching responsible for determining the suitable steering command, that better fits the user command, taking the user competence on steering the wheelchair into account. Experimental results using Robchair, the RW platform developed at ISR-UC [1], [2] are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies."

For some objects, it is known that implementations can be significantly more efficient when their usage is restricted. However, apart from the specific restriction of one-shot implementations, where each process may apply only a single operation to the object, very little is known about the complexities of objects under general restrictions.   This paper draws a more complete picture by defining a large class of objects for which an operation applied to the object can be perturbed L consecutive times, and proving lower bounds on the time and space complexity of deterministic implementations of such objects. This class includes bounded-value max registers, limited-use approximate and exact counters, and limited-use collect and compare-and-swap objects; L depends on the number of times the object can be accessed or the maximum value it supports.   For implementations that use only historyless primitives, we prove lower bounds of Omega(min(log L, n)) on the worst-case step complexity of an operation, where n is the number of processes; we also prove lower bounds of Omega( min( L, n )) on the space complexity of these objects. When arbitrary primitives can be used, we prove that either some operation incurs Omega( min( log L, n)) memory stalls or some operation performs Omega( min( log L, n)) steps.   In addition to these deterministic lower bounds, the paper establishes a lower bound on the expected step complexity of restricted-use randomized approximate counting in a weak oblivious adversary model."
2095092,15514,23684,Persistent predecessor search and orthogonal point location on the word RAM,2011,"We answer a basic data structuring question (for example, raised by Dietz and Raman back in SODA 1991): can van Emde Boas trees be made persistent, without changing their asymptotic query/update time? We present a (partially) persistent data structure that supports predecessor search in a set of integers in {1,..., U } under an arbitrary sequence of  n  insertions and deletions, with  O (log log  U ) expected query time and expected amortized update time, and  O ( n ) space. The query bound is optimal in  U  for linear-space structures and improves previous near- O ((log log  U ) 2 ) methods.   The same method solves a fundamental problem from computational geometry: point location in orthogonal planar subdivisions (where edges are vertical or horizontal). We obtain the first static data structure achieving  O (log log  U ) worst-case query time and linear space. This result is again optimal in  U  for linear-space structures and improves the previous  O ((log log  U ) 2 ) method by de Berg, Snoeyink, and van Kreveld (1992). The same result also holds for higher-dimensional subdivisions that are orthogonal binary space partitions, and for certain nonorthogonal planar subdivisions such as triangulations without small angles. Many geometric applications follow, including improved query times for orthogonal range reporting for dimensions ≥ 3 on the RAM.   Our key technique is an interesting new van-Emde-Boas-style recursion that alternates between two strategies, both quite simple."
1262722,15514,23735,A general tactile approach for grasping unknown objects with a humanoid robot,2013,"In this paper, we present a tactile approach to grasp large and unknown objects, which can not be easily manipulated with a single end-effector or two-handed grasps, with the whole upper body of a humanoid robot. Instead of conventional joint level force sensing, we equip the robot with various patches of HEX-o-SKIN - a self-organizing, multi-modal cellular artificial skin. Low-level controllers, one allocated to each sensor cell, utilize a self-explored inverted jacobian-like sensory-motor map to directly transfer tactile stimulation into reactive arm motions, altering basic grasping trajectories to the need of the current object. A high-level state machine guides those low-level controllers during the different states of the grasping action. Desired contact points, and key poses for the trajectory generation, are taught through forceless tactile stimulation. First experiments on a position controlled robot, an HRP-2 humanoid, demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Our paper contributes to the first realization of a self-organizing tactile sensor-behavior mapping on a full-sized humanoid robot, which enables: 1) a new general approach for grasping unknown objects with the whole-body; and 2) a novel way of teaching behaviors using pre-contact tactile sensing."
880581,15514,9475,Models and efficient algorithms for pickup and delivery problems on roadmaps,2012,"One of the most common combinatorial problems in logistics and transportation—after the Traveling Salesman Problem—is the Stacker Crane Problem (SCP), where commodities or customers are associated each with a pickup location and a delivery location, and the objective is to find a minimum-length tour ‘picking up’ and ‘delivering’ all items, while ensuring the number of items on-board never exceeds a given capacity. While vastly many SCPs encountered in practice are embedded in road or road-like networks, very few studies explicitly consider such environments. In this paper, first, we formulate an environment model capturing the essential features of a “small-neighborhood” road network, along with models for omni-directional vehicles and directed vehicles. Then, we formulate a stochastic version of the unit-capacity SCP, on our road network model, where pickup/delivery sites are random points along segments of the network. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem that is asymptotically constant-factor; i.e., it produces a solution no worse than k+o(1) times the length of the optimal one, where o(1) goes to zero as the number of items grows large, almost surely. The constant k is at most 3, and for omni-directional vehicles it is provably 1, i.e., optimal. Simulations show that with a number of pickup/delivery pairs as low as 50, the proposed algorithm delivers a solution whose cost is consistently within 10% of that of an optimal solution."
2447004,15514,23735,Asymptotically-optimal path planning for manipulation using incremental sampling-based algorithms,2011,"A desirable property of path planning for robotic manipulation is the ability to identify solutions in a sufficiently short amount of time to be usable. This is particularly challenging for the manipulation problem due to the need to plan over high-dimensional configuration spaces and to perform computationally expensive collision checking procedures. Consequently, existing planners take steps to achieve desired solution times at the cost of low quality solutions. This paper presents a planning algorithm that overcomes these difficulties by augmenting the asymptotically-optimal RRT* with a sparse sampling procedure. With the addition of a collision checking procedure that leverages memoization, this approach has the benefit that it quickly identifies low-cost feasible trajectories and takes advantage of subsequent computation time to refine the solution towards an optimal one. We evaluate the algorithm through a series of Monte Carlo simulations of seven, twelve, and fourteen degree of freedom manipulation planning problems in a realistic simulation environment. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides significant improvements in the quality of both the initial solution and the final path, while incurring almost no computational overhead compared to the RRT algorithm. We conclude with a demonstration of our algorithm for single-arm and dual-arm planning on Willow Garage's PR2 robot."
909994,15514,23735,Learning and generalizing force control policies for sculpting,2012,"Humans exhibit exceptional skills in using tools and manipulating objects of their environment by skillfully controlling exerted force and arm impedance. One of the basic components of this mechanism is the generation of internal models which associate kinematic variables with applied force. On the other hand, making robots capable of skillfully using tools and adapting their motor behavior to new environmental conditions is rather complex. In the present paper, we investigate learning of force control policies for robotic sculpting given multiple task demonstrations. These policies express the relationship between constrained motions and exerted force and are learned in Cartesian space where the coupling of dynamics between different directions of motion is also taken into account. In addition, a novel algorithm is proposed to generalize these policies to new motion tasks, executed in a sufficiently homogeneous environment, same with that in demonstrations, but in presence of new motion-dependent external forces. To this aim, a differential calculus approach is proposed where not only the mapping from motion to force but also from difference in motion to difference in force is learned to generalize the policies to new contexts. This is achieved by learning apart from a set of policy parameters, some newly introduced quantities, so called weight differentials, which express the rate of change of the policy parameters. The proposed approach is validated in simple real-world sculpting experiments by using a two degrees-of-freedom haptic device."
990054,15514,23684,"The streaming complexity of cycle counting, sorting by reversals, and other problems",2011,"In this paper we introduce a new technique for proving streaming lower bounds (and one-way communication lower bounds), by reductions from a problem called the Boolean Hidden Hypermatching problem (BHH). BHH is a generalization of the well-known Boolean Hidden Matching problem, which was used by Gavinsky et al. to prove an exponential separation between quantum communication complexity and one-way randomized communication complexity. We are the first to introduce BHH, and to prove a lower bound for it.   The hardness of the BHH problem is inherently oneway: it is easy to solve BHH using logarithmic two-way communication, but it requires √ n  communication if Alice is only allowed to send messages to Bob, and not vice-versa. This one-wayness allows us to prove lower bounds, via reductions, for streaming problems and related communication problems whose hardness is also inherently one-way.   By designing reductions from BHH, we prove lower bounds for the streaming complexity of approximating the sorting by reversal distance, of approximately counting the number of cycles in a 2-regular graph, and of other problems.   For example, here is one lower bound that we prove, for a cycle-counting problem: Alice gets a perfect matching  E   A   on a set of  n  nodes, and Bob gets a perfect matching  E   B   on the same set of nodes. The union  E   A   U  E   B   is a collection of cycles, and the goal is to approximate the number of cycles in this collection. We prove that if Alice is allowed to send  o (√ n ) bits to Bob (and Bob is not allowed to send anything to Alice), then the number of cycles cannot be approximated to within a factor of 1.999, even using a randomized protocol. We prove that it is not even possible to distinguish the case where all cycles are of length 4, from the case where all cycles are of length 8. This lower bound is natively one-way: With 4 rounds of communication, it is easy to distinguish these two cases."
2644781,15514,23684,Ironing in dynamic revenue management: posted prices & biased auctions,2013,"We consider the design of the revenue maximizing mechanism for a seller with a fixed capacity of C units selling over T periods to buyers who arrive over time. The buyers have single unit demand and multi-dimensional private information-- both their value for the object and the deadline by which they must make a purchase are unknown to the seller. This contrasts with previous work where buyers have single dimensional private information-- deadlines are publicly observed and only values are private. Here, the optimal mechanism can be computed by running a dynamic stochastic knapsack algorithm. However, these mechanisms are only optimal with private deadlines when the calculated allocation rule is monotone-- buyers with higher values and later deadlines should be allocated with higher probability. Such monotonicity only arises in very special cases.#R##N##R##N#By contrast, in the classic static environment of Myerson [7] monotonicity is only violated for 'irregular' value distributions. Myerson characterizes the optimal mechanism by a procedure he calls 'ironing.' We characterize the optimal mechanism in our general dynamic environment by providing the dynamic counterpart of ironing. We show that only a subset of the monotonicity constraints can bind in a solution of the seller's dynamic programming problem. The optimal mechanism can be characterized by 'relaxing' these constraints with their appropriate dual multiplier. Further, the optimal mechanism can be implemented by a series of posted prices followed by a 'biased' auction in the final period where buyers have the auction biased in their favor depending on their arrival time. Our theoretical characterization complements the existing computational approaches for ironing in these settings (e.g. Parkes et al. [10])."
916580,15514,65,Addressers' gesture changes according to addressees' interpretation of communicative intention,2014,"To construct mind-reading robots, it is important to correctly identify the communicative intention of humans. In human environments, there are usually an enormous number of objects, and each object has many different parts. Therefore, referring to an object or an object part in current communication is not an easy task. We use both linguistic and nonlinguistic information to specify such referential intentions, but exactly how nonlinguistic information is used has not been examined in detail. In this study, video data from eight pairs of adult addressers and addressees who communicated about whole-object or object-part labels were analyzed. The addressers' utterances were transcribed, and nouns and demonstrative words were extracted. Hand motions were divided into five categories: showing, pointing, stroking, functional action, and other. Gaze data obtained using eye movement recordings were also coded using the following categories: gaze on object, face, or body of the experimenter and other. Gaze on object was further divided into two categories; critical and noncritical object parts. The results showed that participants used different patterns of hand motions and gaze to refer to whole-object and object-part labels. When they taught whole-object labels, they showed the object and looked at the addressee's face. When they taught object-part labels, they pointed at, stroked, and looked at the object part. Based on the results, we propose the concept of action contrast in human communication of referential intention. We propose that the need for specification and the use of actions in a contrasting manner are related. Nonlinguistic cues, such as pointing and showing, and timing of utterances are important sources of information that specify human referential intentions in the environment. Action contrast is an important source of information specifying addressers' referential intentions, which can be utilized to construct mind-reading robots."
1563516,15514,23735,Learning hierarchical representation with sparsity for RGB-D object recognition,2012,"RGB-D sensor has gained its popularity in the study of object recognition for its low cost as well as its capability to provide synchronized RGB and depth images. Thus, researchers have proposed new methods to extract features from RGB-D data. On the other hand, learning-based feature representation is a promising approach for 2D image classification. By exploiting sparsity in 2D image signals, we can learn image representation instead of using hand-crafted local descriptors like SIFT or HoG. This framework inspired us to learn features from RGB-D data. Our work focuses on two goals. First, we propose a novel Hierarchical Sparse Shape Descriptor (HSSD) to form learning-based representation for 3D shapes. To achieve this, we analyze several 3D feature extraction techniques and propose a unified view of them. Then, we learn hierarchical shape representation with sparse coding, max pooling and local grouping. Second, we investigate whether RGB and depth information should be fused at lower level or higher level. Experimental results show that, first, our HSSD algorithm can learn shape dictionary and provide shape cues in addition to the 2D cues. Using the proposed HSSD algorithm achieves 84% accuracy on a household RGB-D object dataset and outperforms a widely used VFH shape feature by 13%. Second, fusing RGB-D information at lower level does not improve recognition performance."
1224808,15514,23735,Outdoor flocking and formation flight with autonomous aerial robots,2014,"We present the first decentralized multi-copter flock that performs stable autonomous outdoor flight with up to 10 flying agents. By decentralized and autonomous we mean that all members navigate themselves based on the dynamic information received from other robots in the vicinity. We do not use central data processing or control; instead, all the necessary computations are carried out by miniature on-board computers. The only global information the system exploits is from GPS receivers, while the units use wireless modules to share this positional information with other flock members locally. Collective behavior is based on a decentralized control framework with bio-inspiration from statistical physical modelling of animal swarms. In addition, the model is optimized for stable group flight even in a noisy, windy, delayed and error-prone environment. Using this framework we successfully implemented several fundamental collective flight tasks with up to 10 units: i) we achieved self-propelled flocking in a bounded area with self-organized object avoidance capabilities and ii) performed collective target tracking with stable formation flights (grid, rotating ring, straight line). With realistic numerical simulations we demonstrated that the local broadcast-type communication and the decentralized autonomous control method allows for the scalability of the model for much larger flocks."
1619389,15514,23735,Construction and use of roadmaps that incorporate workspace modeling errors,2013,"Probabilistic Roadmap Methods (PRMs) have been shown to work well at solving high Degree of Freedom (DoF) motion planning problems. They work by constructing a roadmap that approximates the topology of collision-free configuration space. However, this requires an accurate model of the robot's workspace in order to test if a sampled configuration is in collision or not. In this paper, we present a method for roadmap construction that can be used in workspaces with uncertainties in the model. For example, these can be inaccuracies that are caused by sensor error when an environment model was constructed. The uncertainty is encoded into the roadmap directly through the incorporation of non-binary collision detection values, e.g., a probability of collision. We refer to this new roadmap as a Safety-PRM because it allows tunability between the expected safety of the robot and the distance along a path. We compare the computational cost of Safety-PRM against two planning methods for environments without modeling errors, basic PRM and Medial Axis PRM (MAPRM), known for low computational cost and maximizing clearance, respectively. We demonstrate that in most cases, Safety-PRM produces high quality paths maximized for clearance and safety with the least amount of computational cost. We show that these paths are tunable for both robot safety and clearance. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of Safety-PRM on an experimental system, a Barrett Whole Arm Manipulator (WAM). On the WAM, we demonstrate the mapping of expected collision to robot speeds to enable the robot to physically test the safety of the roadmap and use torque estimation to make roadmap modifications."
949429,15514,23735,Uncertainty-driven survey path planning for bathymetric mapping,2013,"We present a novel survey path planning technique which minimizes the robot's position uncertainty along the planned path while taking into account area coverage performance. The proposed technique especially targets bathymetric mapping applications and respects application constraints such as the desire to survey in parallel tracks and to avoid turns in the target area to maximize sonar measurements quality. While accounting for uncertainty in the survey planning process can lead to more accurate data products, existing survey planning tools typically ignore it. Our method bridges this gap using the saliency on an a priori map to predict how the terrain will affect the robot's belief at every point on the target area. Based on this magnitude, we provide an algorithm that computes the order in which to trace parallel tracks to cover the target area minimizing the overall uncertainty along the path. A particle filter keeps track of the robot's position uncertainty during the planning process and, in order to find useful loop-closures for mapping, crossing tracks that visit salient locations are added when the uncertainty surpasses a user-provided threshold. We test our method on real-world datasets collected off the coasts of Spain, Greece and Australia. We evaluate the expected robot's position uncertainty along the planned paths and assess their associated mapping performance using a bathymetric mapping algorithm. Results show that our method offers benefits over a standard lawnmower-type path both in terms of position uncertainty and map quality."
702967,15514,23735,Preliminary experiments of a miniature robotic system for tooth ablation using ultra-short pulsed lasers,2013,"As a preliminary step to achieve a long-term goal of developing an automatic dental preparation system for clinical operations, we design and build a miniature robotic system which can manipulate a laser beam to move in three dimensional spaces to remove hard tissue from a target tooth. The dental preparation requires the robotic system to own high accuracy, high ablation speed and small size. A 2D galvanometer scanners module is integrated to meet the requirement of a high moving speed of the laser focus. A closed-loop system based on a miniature-sized voice-coil motor and a grating ruler are developed to realize the accurate control of the focus. The overall size of the developed prototype is 108mm×56mm×43mm, which is small enough to be used in close proximity to a patient's mouth. The prototype has been tested by using two different kinds of laser generators, i.e., a nanosecond laser and a picosecond laser. The experiment results show that the robotic system can provide high moving speed of 1000mm/s with good shape accuracy. From the results, we found that nanosecond laser beam can be controlled to ablate zirconia and aluminum, but not suitable to ablate tooth because of tissue carbonization. By selecting suitable parameters of the picosecond laser generator, a target tooth could be ablated to produce a cylinder shape without carbonization. Limitations of the prototype are identified according to the experiment results."
695735,15514,23634,How to Approximate a Set without Knowing Its Size in Advance,2013,"The dynamic approximate membership problem asks to represent a set S of size n, whose elements are provided in an on-line fashion, supporting membership queries without false negatives and with a false positive rate at most e. That is, the membership algorithm must be correct on each x ∈ S, and may err with probability at most e on each x ∉ S. We study a well-motivated, yet insufficiently explored, variant of this problem where the size n of the set is not known in advance. Existing optimal approximate membership data structures require that the size is known in advance, but in many practical scenarios this is not a realistic assumption. Moreover, even if the eventual size n of the set is known in advance, it is desirable to have the smallest possible space usage also when the current number of inserted elements is smaller than n. Our contribution consists of the following results: (1) We show a super-linear gap between the space complexity when the size is known in advance and the space complexity when the size is not known in advance. When the size is known in advance, it is well-known that Θ(n log(1/e)) bits of space are necessary and sufficient (Bloom '70, Carter et al. '78). However, when the size is not known in advance, we prove that at least (1 -o(1))n log(1/e)+Ω(n log log n) bits of space must be used. In particular, the average number of bits per element must depend on the size of the set. . We show that our space lower bound is tight, and can even be matched by a highly efficient data structure. We present a data structure that uses (1+o(1))n log(1/e)+O(n log log n) bits of space for approximating any set of any size n, without having to know n in advance. Our data structure supports membership queries in constant time in the worst case with high probability, and supports insertions in expected amortized constant time. Moreover, it can be “de-amortized” to support also insertions in constant time in the worst case with high probability by only increasing its space usage to O(n log(1/e) + n loglogn) bits."
2640382,15514,23684,Fast algorithms for maximizing submodular functions,2014,"There has been much progress recently on improved approximations for problems involving submodular objective functions, and many interesting techniques have been developed. However, the resulting algorithms are often slow and impractical. In this paper we develop algorithms that match the best known approximation guarantees, but with significantly improved running times, for maximizing a monotone submodular function f: 2[n] → R+ subject to various constraints. As in previous work, we measure the number of oracle calls to the objective function which is the dominating term in the running time.#R##N##R##N#Our first result is a simple algorithm that gives a (1--1/e -- e)-approximation for a cardinality constraint using O(n/e log n/e) queries, and a 1/(p + 2e + 1 + e)-approximation for the intersection of a p-system and e knapsack (linear) constraints using O (n/e2 log2 n/e) queries. This is the first approximation for a p-system combined with linear constraints. (We also show that the factor of p cannot be improved for maximizing over a p-system.) The main idea behind these algorithms serves as a building block in our more sophisticated algorithms.#R##N##R##N#Our main result is a new variant of the continuous greedy algorithm, which interpolates between the classical greedy algorithm and a truly continuous algorithm. We show how this algorithm can be implemented for matroid and knapsack constraints using O(n2) oracle calls to the objective function. (Previous variants and alternative techniques were known to use at least O(n4) oracle calls.) This leads to an O(n2/e4 log2 n/e)-time (1--1/e -- e)-approximation for a matroid constraint. For a knapsack constraint, we develop a more involved (1--1/e -- e)-approximation algorithm that runs in time O(n2(1/e log n)poly(1/e))."

The objective is to minimize the length of a codeword sent to all receivers which allows each receiver to learn its bit. For linear index coding, the minimum possible length is known to be equal to a graph parameter called minrank (Bar-Yossef et al., FOCS, 2006).#R##N##R##N#We show a polynomial time algorithm that, given an n vertex graph G with minrank k, finds a linear index code for G of length O(nf(k)), where f(k) depends only on k. For example, for k = 3 we obtain f(3) a 0.2574. Our algorithm employs a semidefinite program (SDP) introduced by Karger, Motwani and Sudan (J. ACM, 1998) for graph coloring and its refined analysis due to Arora, Chlamtac and Charikar (STOC, 2006). Since the SDP we use is not a relaxation of the minimization problem we consider, a crucial component of our analysis is an upper bound on the objective value of the SDP in terms of the minrank.#R##N##R##N#At the heart of our analysis lies a combinatorial result which may be of independent interest. Namely, we show an exact expression for the maximum possible value of the Lovasz θ-function of a graph with minrank k.

1128672,15514,23735,Adaptive internal impedance control for stable walking on uncertain visco-elastic terrains,2012,"This paper investigates how a walker could maintain the variability of an arbitrary set of state variables within desired margins while walking on an uncertain soft terrain. The state variables are dynamically related to the visco-elastic impedance parameters of the body on a given set of uncertain soft terrains using internal memory primitives. A rimless wheel, a walker in its simplest form, is used to perform numerical simulations based on analytical dynamic models and hardware experiments to test a novel algorithm. The rimless wheel model is widely used by the legged locomotion research community to understand basic collision and energetics during passive dynamic walking. Very often, variability of punctuated force perturbations across collisions between the legs and the ground cause uncertain steady state dynamics of walking. This leads to the existence of a finite probability that certain state variables can reach unstable regions. Such phenomenon is known as metastability of walking. In this case, we actuate the rimless wheel with a constant torque leaving it to develop any speed profile for a given visco-elastic impedance distribution of the ground and its own vertical visco-elastic impedance that pushes the rimless wheel against the ground. Here we measure the robustness of the novel algorithm by its ability to shift the distribution of collision forces to a safer region in order to minimize the probability of reaching a given critical force threshold. Our analysis shows that the generalization of the variability of walking in different regions of the internal and external visco-elastic impedance spaces can simplify the computational challenges of robust walking on uncertain visco-elastic terrains."
2221851,15514,23735,The sigma.7 haptic interface for MiroSurge: A new bi-manual surgical console,2011,"This paper presents the design and control of the sigma.7 haptic device and the new surgical console of the MiroSurge robotic system. The console and the haptic devices are designed with respect to requirements in minimally invasive robotic surgery. Dedicated left and right handed devices are integrated in an operator console in an ergonomic configuration. The height of the whole console is adjustable, allowing the surgeon seated and standed operation. Each of the devices is fully actuated in seven degrees of freedom (DoF). A parallel mechanism with 3 DoF actuates the translational motion and an attached wrist with 3 intersecting axis drives the rotations of the grasping unit. This advantageous design leads to inherently decoupled kinematics and dynamics. Cartesian forces are 20 N within the translational workspace, which is a sphere of about 120 mm diameter for each device. The rotational wrist of the device covers the whole workspace of the human hand and provides maximum torques of about 0.4 Nm. The grasping unit can display forces up to 8 N. An integrated force/torque sensor is used to increase the transparency of the devices by reducing inertia and friction. It is theoretically shown that the non-linear closed loop system behaves like a passive system and experimental results validate the approach. The sigma.7 haptic devices are designed by Force Dimension in cooperation with the German Aerospace Center (DLR). DLR designed the surgical console and integrated the haptic devices in the MiroSurge system."
2552845,15514,20332,Green driver: AI in a microcosm,2011,"The Green Driver app is a dynamic routing application for GPS-enabled smartphones. Green Driver combines client GPS data with real-time traffic light information provided by cities to determine optimal routes in response to driver route requests. Routes are optimized with respect to travel time, with the intention of saving the driver both time and fuel, and rerouting can occur if warranted. During a routing session, client phones communicate with a centralized server that both collects GPS data and processes route requests. All relevant data are anonymized and saved to databases for analysis; statistics are calculated from the aggregate data and fed back to the routing engine to improve future routing. Analyses can also be performed to discern driver trends: where do drivers tend to go, how long do they stay, when and where does traffic congestion occur, and so on. The system uses a number of techniques from the field of artificial intelligence. We apply a variant of A* search for solving the stochastic shortest path problem in order to find optimal driving routes through a network of roads given light-status information. We also use dynamic programming and hidden Markov models to determine the progress of a driver through a network of roads from GPS data and light-status data. The Green Driver system is currently deployed for testing in Eugene, Oregon, and is scheduled for large-scale deployment in Portland, Oregon, in Spring 2011."
1475459,15514,23735,Hopping control for the musculoskeletal bipedal robot: BioBiped,2014,"Bipedal locomotion can be divided into primitive tasks, namely repulsive leg behavior (bouncing against gravity), leg swing (protraction and retraction) and body alignment (balancing against gravity). In the bipedal spring-mass model for walking and running, the repulsive leg function is described by a linear prismatic spring. This paper adopts two strategies for swinging and bouncing control from conceptual models for the human-inspired musculoskeletal BioBiped robot. The control approach consists of two layers, velocity based leg adjustment (VBLA) and virtual model control to represent a virtual springy leg between toe and hip. Additionally, the rest length and stiffness of the virtual springy leg are tuned based on events to compensate energy losses due to damping. In order to mimic human locomotion, the trunk is held upright by physical constraints. The controller is implemented on the validated detailed simulation model of BioBiped. In- place as well as forward hopping and switching between these two gaits are easily achieved by tuning the parameters for the leg adjustment, virtual leg stiffness and injected energy. Furthermore, it is shown that the achieved motion performance of in-place hopping agrees well with that of human subjects. I.

747634,15514,23735,Learning sequential tasks interactively from demonstrations and own experience,2013,"Deploying robots to our day-to-day life requires them to have the ability to learn from their environment in order to acquire new task knowledge and to flexibly adapt existing skills to various situations. For typical real-world tasks, it is not sufficient to endow robots with a set of primitive actions. Rather, they need to learn how to sequence these in order to achieve a desired effect on their environment. In this paper, we propose an intuitive learning method for a robot to acquire sequences of motions by combining learning from human demonstrations and reinforcement learning. In every situation, our approach treats both ways of learning as alternative control flows to optimally exploit their strengths without inheriting their shortcomings. Using a Gaussian Process approximation of the state-action sequence value function, our approach generalizes values observed from demonstrated and autonomously generated action sequences to unknown inputs. This approximation is based on a kernel we designed to account for different representations of tasks and action sequences as well as inputs of variable length. From the expected deviation of value estimates, we devise a greedy exploration policy following a Bayesian optimization criterion that quickly converges learning to promising action sequences while protecting the robot from sequences with unpredictable outcome. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to efficiently learn appropriate action sequences in various situations on a manipulation task involving stacked boxes."
2047852,15514,65,A novel variable impedance compact compliant series elastic actuator for human-friendly soft robotics applications,2012,"This paper presents the analysis of electro-mechanical design, materials, dynamics and control of a novel variable impedance compact compliant series elastic actuator (SEA) to improve human-robot interactions in human-friendly soft robotics applications. The design consists of a servomotor, a ball screw, a torsional spring connecting the servomotor and the ball screw via a pair of spur gear, and a set of translational springs connecting the ball screw nut to the output link. The translational springs have low stiffness and these are used to handle low force operations that reduce non-linear friction, output impedance, impact etc. The torsional spring is in the high speed range, has high effective stiffness and it enhances the system bandwidth for large force operations when the translational springs are fully compressed. Design, materials for construction, kinematics and working principle of the actuator are analyzed. Then, dynamics modeling and control on the physical implementation of the actuator for different conditions are analyzed. The conditions are: (i) open loop transfer function with load end fixed, (ii) closed loop transfer function with load end fixed, and (iii) output impedance with load end free for (i) low force, and (ii) high force cases. Then, the advantages of the design over its existing counterparts are discussed and its potential applications are mentioned. This novel SEA overcomes the major limitations of the existing SEAs, and can be used to develop human-friendly soft robots for various applications."
1854387,15514,23634,Nearly Maximum Flows in Nearly Linear Time,2013,"We introduce a new approach to the maximum flow problem in undirected, capacitated graphs using congestion-approximators: easy-to-compute functions that approximate the congestion required to route single-commodity demands in a graph to within some factor α. Our algorithm maintains an arbitrary flow that may have some residual excess and deficits, while taking steps to minimize a potential function measuring the congestion of the current flow plus an over-estimate of the congestion required to route the residual demand. Since the residual term over-estimates, the descent process gradually moves the contribution to our potential function from the residual term to the congestion term, eventually achieving a flow routing the desired demands with nearly minimal congestion after Õ(α 2 e -2  log 2  n) iterations. Our approach is similar in spirit to that used by Spielman and Teng (STOC 2004) for solving Laplacian systems, and we summarize our approach as trying to do for l ∞ -flows what they do for l ∞ -flows. Together with a nearly linear time construction of a no(1)-congestion-approximator, we obtain 1 + e-optimal singlecommodity flows undirected graphs in time m 1+o (1)e -2 , yielding the fastest known algorithm for that problem. Our requirements of a congestion-approximator are quite low, suggesting even faster and simpler algorithms for certain classes of graphs. For example, an α-competitive oblivious routing tree meets our definition, even without knowing how to route the tree back in the graph. For graphs of conductance φ, a trivial φ -1 -congestionapproximator gives an extremely simple algorithm for finding Õ(mφ -1 )."

There is a significant gap between known upper and lower bounds for Densest k-subgraph: the current best algorithm gives an a O(n1/4) approximation, while even showing a small constant factor hardness requires significantly stronger assumptions than P ≠ NP. In addition to interest in designing better algorithms, a number of recent results have exploited the conjectured hardness of Densest k-subgraph and its variants. Thus, understanding the approximability of Densest k-subgraph is an important challenge.#R##N##R##N#In this work, we give evidence for the hardness of approximating Densest k-subgraph within polynomial factors. Specifically, we expose the limitations of strong semidefinite programs from SDP hierarchies in solving Densest k-subgraph. Our results include:#R##N##R##N#• A lower bound of Ω(n1/4/log3 n) on the integrality gap for Ω(log n/log log n) rounds of the Sherali-Adams relaxation for Densest k-subgraph. This also holds for the relaxation obtained from Sherali-Adams with an added SDP constraint. Our gap instances are in fact Erdos-Renyi random graphs.#R##N##R##N#• For every e > 0, a lower bound of n2/53−e on the integrality gap of nΩ(e) rounds of the Lasserre SDP relaxation for Densest k-subgraph, and an nΩe(1) gap for n1−e rounds. Our construction proceeds via a reduction from random instances of a certain Max-CSP over large domains.#R##N##R##N#In the absence of inapproximability results for Densest k-subgraph, our results show that beating a factor of nΩ(1) is a barrier for even the most powerful SDPs, and in fact even beating the best known n1/4 factor is a barrier for current techniques.#R##N##R##N#Our results indicate that approximating Densest k-subgraph within a polynomial factor might be a harder problem than Unique Games or Small Set Expansion, since these problems were recently shown to be solvable using neΩ(1) rounds of the Lasserre hierarchy, where e is the completeness parameter in Unique Games and Small Set Expansion."
1016641,15514,23735,Haptic rendering of interacting dynamic deformable objects simulated in real-time at different frequencies,2013,"The dynamic response of deformable bodies varies significantly in dependence on mechanical properties of the objects: while the dynamics of a stiff and light object (e. g. wire or needle) involves high-frequency phenomena such as vibrations, much lower frequencies are sufficient for capturing the dynamic response of an object composed of a soft tissue. Yet, when simulating mechanical interactions between soft and stiff deformable models, a single time-step in the time integration is usually employed to compute the dynamics of both objects. However, this can be a serious issue when the haptic rendering of complex scenes composed of various bodies is considered. In this paper, we present a novel method allowing for the haptic simulation of a scene composed of colliding objects modeled at different frequencies: typically, the dynamics of soft objects is calculated at a frequency of about 50Hz, while the dynamics of stiff object is simulated at 1 kHz, being directly connected to the computation of the haptic force feedback. The collision response is performed at both low and high frequencies employing data structures which describe the actual constraints and are shared between the high and low frequency loops. We show that during the simulation we show that the objects behave according to two mechanical principles: non-inter-penetration and action-reaction principles. Examples showing the scenes involving different bodies in interaction are given, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed method."
1464863,15514,23634,Solving Connectivity Problems Parameterized by Treewidth in Single Exponential Time,2011,"For the vast majority of local problems on graphs of small tree width (where by local we mean that a solution can be verified by checking separately the neighbourhood of each vertex), standard dynamic programming techniques give c^tw |V|^O(1) time algorithms, where tw is the tree width of the input graph G = (V, E) and c is a constant. On the other hand, for problems with a global requirement (usually connectivity) the best -- known algorithms were naive dynamic programming schemes running in at least tw^tw time. We breach this gap by introducing a technique we named Cut&Count that allows to produce c^tw |V|^O(1) time Monte Carlo algorithms for most connectivity-type problems, including Hamiltonian Path, Steiner Tree, Feedback Vertex Set and Connected Dominating Set. These results have numerous consequences in various fields, like parameterized complexity, exact and approximate algorithms on planar and H-minor-free graphs and exact algorithms on graphs of bounded degree. The constant c in our algorithms is in all cases small, and in several cases we are able to show that improving those constants would cause the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis to fail. In contrast to the problems aiming to minimize the number of connected components that we solve using Cut&Count as mentioned above, we show that, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, the aforementioned gap cannot be breached for some problems that aim to maximize the number of connected components like Cycle Packing."
1758092,15514,23735,Modeling and experiments of high speed magnetic micromanipulation at the air/liquid interface,2014,"One of the greatest challenge in microrobotics is the development of miniaturized smart surfaces for a high speed conveying and positioning of micro-objects. This paper proposes a new approach where objects are situated at the air/liquid interface and are manipulated through magnetic fields. It demonstrates that a good repeatability and a high speed can be obtained. A physical modeling is presented to analyze the dynamic behavior of the micro-object. Experiments are performed to determine the physical parameters of the model and to attest the good repeatability of the motion for an object of size 100x90x25 m 3 . A good agreement between the physical model and the experimental measurement is demonstrated. Since the velocity of the micro-object can be 10 times higher at the air/liquid interface than in the liquid this approach represents a promising solution to design smart surfaces for a high throughput conveying of micro-objects. I. INTRODUCTION Complementary to smart surfaces proposed in the literature, this paper proposes a planar magnetic micromanipulation principle. The micro-object is placed at the interface between two fluids, and the actuation is ensured by magnetic forces. The object is in equilibrium on the interface under the action of the surface tension and its weight and it moves on the surface with minimum friction. This approach enables to avoid adhesion issues and provides a high velocity motion. A model of the system is proposed, and the physical parameters, namely the drag coefficient and the magnetization, are identified. The repeatability and velocity are discussed and the dynamic model derived in this article can be used for closed loop control in future works."
1298154,15514,23735,Touch attention Bayesian models for robotic active haptic exploration of heterogeneous surfaces,2014,"This work contributes to the development of active haptic exploration strategies of surfaces using robotic hands in environments with an unknown structure. The architecture of the proposed approach consists two main Bayesian models, implementing the touch attention mechanisms of the system. The model π per  perceives and discriminates different categories of materials (haptic stimulus) integrating compliance and texture features extracted from haptic sensory data. The model π tar  actively infers the next region of the workspace that should be explored by the robotic system, integrating the task information, the permanently updated saliency and uncertainty maps extracted from the perceived haptic stimulus map, as well as, inhibition-of-return mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate that the Bayesian model π per  can be used to discriminate 10 different classes of materials with an average recognition rate higher than 90%. The generalization capability of the proposed models was demonstrated experimentally. The ATLAS robot, in the simulation, was able to perform the following of a discontinuity between two regions made of different materials with a divergence smaller than 1cm (30 trials). The tests were performed in scenarios with 3 different configurations of the discontinuity. The Bayesian models have demonstrated the capability to manage the uncertainty about the structure of the surfaces and sensory noise to make correct motor decisions from haptic percepts."
880230,15514,23735,Scheduling operator attention for Multi-Robot Control,2012,"A wide class of multirobot control tasks involves operator interactions with individual robots. Where the robots' actions are independent, as for example in some foraging tasks, the operator can interact with robots sequentially in a round robin fashion. If the need for interaction can be detected by the robot through self-reflection, the robot could communicate its need for interaction to the operator. The resulting human-robot system would form a queuing system in which the operator is the server and the queue of robots requesting interaction, the jobs. As a queuing system, performance could be optimized using standard techniques, providing the operator's attention could be appropriately directed. An earlier study found that Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) performance was improved by communicating requests for interaction to the operator, however, a first-in-first-out (FIFO) aid showing a single request at a time led to poorer performance than one showing the entire (Open) queue. The current experiment compared Open-queue and FIFO conditions from the first experiment with a Priority-queue using a shortest job first (SJF) discipline known to maximize throughput. Performance in the Priority-queue condition was statistically indistinguishable from the best performance for all measures except those for missed victims where it was intermediate between FIFO (best) and Open-queue. Both of the other conditions produced poorest performance on some measures. The results suggest that operator attention can be effectively scheduled allowing the use of scheduling algorithms to improve the efficiency of HRI."
810973,15514,23735,Informed RRT*: Optimal sampling-based path planning focused via direct sampling of an admissible ellipsoidal heuristic,2014,"Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are pop- ular in motion planning because they find solutions efficiently to single-query problems. Optimal RRTs (RRT*s) extend RRTs to the problem of finding the optimal solution, but in doing so asymptotically find the optimal path from the initial state to every state in the planning domain. This behaviour is not only inefficient but also inconsistent with their single-query nature. For problems seeking to minimize path length, the subset of states that can improve a solution can be described by a prolate hyperspheroid. We show that unless this subset is sam- pled directly, the probability of improving a solution becomes arbitrarily small in large worlds or high state dimensions. In this paper, we present an exact method to focus the search by directly sampling this subset. The advantages of the presented sampling technique are demonstrated with a new algorithm, Informed RRT*. This method retains the same probabilistic guarantees on complete- ness and optimality as RRT* while improving the convergence rate and final solution quality. We present the algorithm as a simple modification to RRT* that could be further extended by more advanced path-planning algorithms. We show exper- imentally that it outperforms RRT* in rate of convergence, final solution cost, and ability to find difficult passages while demonstrating less dependence on the state dimension and range of the planning problem."
2592613,15514,23684,Hallucination helps: energy efficient virtual circuit routing,2014,"We consider virtual circuit routing protocols, with an objective of minimizing energy, in a network of components that are speed scalable, and that may be shutdown when idle. We assume that the speed s of a link is proportional to its load, and assume the standard model for component power, namely that the power is some constant static power σ plus sα, where typically α e [1.1, 3]. We give a polynomial-time offline algorithm for multicommodity routing, that has approximation ratio O(logα k), where k is the number of demand pairs. This is obtained as a combination of three natural combinatorial algorithms. The key step of the algorithm design is a random sampling technique that we call hallucination, which is reminiscent of the Sample-Augment framework for solving Buy-at-Bulk type problems, and sampling in cut-sparsification algorithms. The analysis of the approximation ratio is then a direct consequence of the flow-cut gap for multicommodity flow. The algorithm extends rather naturally to an online algorithm, which we show has competitive ratio O(log3α+1k. The analysis of the online algorithm introduces a natural priority multicommodity flow problem, and bounds the priority multicommodity flow-cut gap-this might also be of independent interest. We also explain how our hallucination technique can be used to achieve an (O(log km), O(log km)) bicriteria approximation result for the problem of buying a minimum cost collection of unit-capacitated edges to support a concurrent multicommodity flow, where m is the number of links in the network."
894839,15514,23684,On succinct convex greedy drawing of 3-connected plane graphs,2011,"Geometric routing by using virtual locations is an elegant way for solving network routing problems. In its simplest form, greedy routing, a message is simply for warded to a neighbor that is closer to the destination. It has been an open conjecture whether every 3-connected plane graph has a greedy drawing in  R  2  (by Papadimitriou and Ratajczak [23]). Leighton and Moitra [20] recently settled this conjecture positively. One main drawback of this approach is that the coordinates of the virtual locations requires Ω( n  log  n ) bits to represent (the same space usage as traditional routing table approaches). This makes greedy routing infeasible in applications. A similar result was obtained by Angelini et al. [2]. However, neither of the two papers give the time efficiency analysis of their algorithms. In addition, as pointed out in [16], the drawings in these two papers are not necessarily planar nor convex.   In this paper, we show that the classical Schnyder drawing in  R  2  of plane triangulations is greedy with respect to a simple natural metric function  H(u, v)  over  R  2  that is equivalent to Euclidean metric  D   E   (u, v)  (in the sense that  D   E   (u, v)    D   E   (u, v) .) The drawing is succinct, using two integer coordinates between 0 and 2 n  − 5.   For 3-connected plane graphs, there is another conjecture by Papadimitriou and Ratajczak (as stated in [16]):   Convex Greedy Embedding Conjecture: Every 3-connected planar graph has a convex greedy embedding in the Euclidean plane.   In a recent paper [6], Cao et al. provided a plane graph  G  and showed that any convex greedy embedding of  G  in Euclidean plane must use Ω( n )-bit coordinates Thus, if we add the succinctness requirement, the Convex Greedy Embedding Conjecture is false.   In this paper, we show that the classical Schnyde drawing in  R  2  of 3-connected plane graphs is  weakly greedy  with respect to the same metric function  H (*, *). The drawing is planar, convex, and succinct, using two integer coordinates between 0 and  f  (where  f  is the number of internal faces of  G )."
1491460,15514,8228,RA-CVS: Cooperating at low power to stream compressively sampled videos,2013,"Video streaming applications are becoming increasingly popular as low priced video-enabled mobile devices (such as smart phones) become more common. However, traditional video streaming systems are not designed for mobile devices, and require both high computational complexity at the video sensor and very high channel quality to achieve good performance. Our recently proposed compressive video sensing (CVS) video streaming system is a low complexity, low power compressed-sensing-based encoder designed to address these challenges. However, even using CVS, the energy consumption of multimedia sensors is still much higher than that of traditional scalar sensors. In this article, we present a cooperative relay-assisted compressed video sensing (RA-CVS) system that takes advantage of the error resilience of video encoded using CVS to maintain good video quality at the receiver while significantly reducing the required SNR, and therefore the required transmission power at the multimedia sensor node. This system uses the natural error resilience of CS encoded video signals to design a cooperative scheme that directly reduces the mean squared error (MSE) of the reconstructed CS samples representing a video frame, which allows the receiver to correctly reconstruct the video even at very low SNR levels. The proposed system is tested using both simulation and USRP2 testbed evaluation and is shown to outperform traditional cooperative systems in terms of received video quality as a function of channel SNR."
1098739,15514,65,Self-corrective cascade control obstacle avoidance and deviation correction system for robotics systems,2013,"In feedback controlled AGVs, errors in movement and trajectory planning are detected after deviation. Therefore, error correction and directing robots to the desired path are much harder than detecting deviation errors at the beginning of each movement such as in feed-forward control system. However, feedback control loop is more promising when the trajectory is unknown. In addition, detection of obstacles should lead finding a new trajectory toward desired destination. We wish to provide a cascade control system consisting of detection of movement and acceleration over surface in addition to checking the shaft encoders connected to each wheel. The system helps overcoming deviation errors in addition to finding an optimal solution for calculated new trajectory using onboard compass module working at both indoor and outdoor environment. The proposed method has been implemented on a twin robot so called Leopard GES. In addition, the designed controller board facilitates robots with wireless and wired communicational platforms on Pico-powered micro controller so that they will be able to communicate with each other, share and cooperate in solving problems collaboratively. Therefore, it changes the current shape of AGVs vastly into new set of cooperative autonomous guided vehicles using the new board equipped with cascade controlled trajectory planner system."
1372036,15514,23735,Orienting deformable polygonal parts without sensors,2012,"Sensorless part orienting has proven useful in manufacturing and automation, while the manipulation of deformable objects is an area of growing interest. Existing sensorless orienting techniques may produce forces which have the potential to damage deformable parts. We present an algorithm that, when provided a geometric description of the part and a deformation model, generates a plan to orient the part up to symmetry from any initial orientation. The solution exploits deformation of the object under certain configurations to help resolve ambiguity. The approach has several attractive features: (1) the resulting plan is a short sequence of such actions guaranteed to succeed for all initial configurations; (2) the algorithm operates even with a very simple model of deformation, but is extensible when specialized knowledge is available; (3) failure to find a feasible solution has precise semantics (e.g., inadequate manipulator precision). We validate the algorithm experimentally with a pair of low-precision robot manipulators, orienting 6 parts made of 4 types of materials, with the correct orientation being reached on 80% of the 192 trials. Careful analysis of the failures emphasizes the importance of low-friction conditions, that increased manipulator precision would be beneficial but is not necessary, and a simple deformation model can suffice. In addition to illustrating the feasibility of sensorless manipulation of deformable parts, we note that the algorithm has applications to manipulation of non-deformable parts without the pressure switch sensor employed in existing sensorless orienting strategies."
1196842,15514,23735,Control allocation of all-wheel drive vehicles: A longitudinal model,2013,"This paper offers a method to compute the control inputs for an all-wheel drive vehicle that moves along a specified path on rough terrain. The focus of this paper is on longitudinal motion only, using a half-car model with no suspensions. For a given path, we first compute the range of the admissible speeds and accelerations at every point along the path, subject to vehicle dynamics and constraints on the wheel/ground forces. A feasible velocity profile along the path is then computed to respect the admissible speeds and accelerations and satisfy given boundary conditions. While the velocity profile represents the accelerations of the center of mass, it remains to determine the control inputs (torques) for the two independent wheels. The challenge stems from the longitudinal model being an indeterminate system, having two control inputs but only one degree-of-freedom along the specified path. This inherent indeterminacy is resolved by adding a virtual suspension to the rigid vehicle model, which allows to explicitly compute the two individual wheel torques. The method is demonstrated for a vehicle moving at the time optimal speeds over a bump. A dynamic simulation of the vehicle with a stiff suspension shows that the two wheels maintain contact with the ground at all times, despite moving at the ultimate speeds. It is also shown that the all-wheel-drive model produces a larger set of admissible speeds and accelerations, and hence results in faster speeds and shorter motion times than the single drive (front or rear) model."
1838247,15514,23735,Autonomous vision-based tethered-assisted rover docking,2013,"Many intriguing science discoveries on planetary surfaces, such as the seasonal flows on crater walls and skylight entrances to lava tubes, are at sites that are currently inaccessible to state-of-the-art rovers. The in situ exploration of such sites is likely to require a tethered platform both for mechanical support and for providing power and communication. Mother/daughter architectures have been investigated where a mother deploys a tethered daughter into extreme terrains. Deploying and retracting a tethered daughter requires undocking and re-docking of the daughter to the mother, with the latter being the challenging part. In this paper, we describe a vision-based tether-assisted algorithm for the autonomous re-docking of a daughter to its mother following an extreme terrain excursion. The algorithm uses fiducials mounted on the mother to improve the reliability and accuracy of estimating the pose of the mother relative to the daughter. The tether that is anchored by the mother helps the docking process and increases the system's tolerance to pose uncertainties by mechanically aligning the mating parts in the final docking phase. A preliminary version of the algorithm was developed and field-tested on the Axel rover in the JPL Mars Yard. The algorithm achieved an 80% success rate in 40 experiments in both firm and loose soils and starting from up to 6 m away at up to 40° radial angle and 20° relative heading. The algorithm does not rely on an initial estimate of the relative pose. The preliminary results are promising and help retire the risk associated with the autonomous docking process enabling consideration in future martian and lunar missions."
1233674,15514,23735,Speed generalization capabilities of a cerebellar model on a rapid navigation task,2013,"The cerebellum is a brain structure necessary for skilled motor behaviour and has a well understood and repetitive architecture. Such an architecture inspired the Marr-Albus-Ito theory of cerebellar learning, that provides an explanation for the acquisition of motor skills by the cerebellum. Numerous computational models inspired in such a theory have already been employed in robotic tasks. Here we look into one of the suggested roles of the cerebellum, the replacement of reflexes by anticipatory actions and we apply it to a robot navigation task. The acquisition of anticipatory actions has been thoroughly studied in the field of classical conditioning. Of particular interest is the so-called CS-intensity effect, an effect that links the rapidity of execution of an anticipatory protective action, the Conditioned Response (CR), to the intensity of a predictive signal, the Conditioning Stimulus (CS). We propose that the CS-intensity effect implements a built-in sensory-motor contingency that allows to carry over a skill learned in a safe and easy context, e.g., turning at slow velocity, to a more difficult one, e.g., a turning at a faster speed. We demonstrate this hypothesis in a series of experiments where a robot has to navigate a track that has a turn. We show that after being trained at a slow velocity, by means of the CS-intensity effect, the cerebellar controller modulates the turning such that its onset anticipates as the robot speed increases. Ultimately, through incremental learning, this generalization allows the robot to learn to navigate the track at its maximum speed."
2810232,15514,23684,Selection and sorting in the restore model,2014,"We consider the classical selection and sorting problems in a model where the initial permutation of the input has to be restored after completing the computation. While the requirement of the restoration is stringent compared to the classical versions of the problems, this model is more relaxed than a read-only memory where the input elements are not allowed to be moved within the input array.#R##N##R##N#We first show that for a sequence of n integers, selection (finding the median or more generally the k-th smallest element for a given k) can be done in O(n) time using O(lg n) words1 of extra space in this model. In contrast, no linear-time selection algorithm is known which uses polylogarithmic space in the read-only memory model.#R##N##R##N#For sorting n integers in this model, we first present an O(n lg n)-time algorithm using O(lg n) words of extra space. When the universe size U is polynomial in n, we give a faster O(n)-time algorithm (analogous to radix sort) which uses O(ne) words of extra space for an arbitrarily small constant e > 0. More generally, we show how to match the time bound of any word-RAM integer-sorting algorithms using O(ne) words of extra space. In sharp contrast, there is an Ω(n2/S)-time lower bound for integer sorting using O(S) bits of space in the read-only memory model. Extension of our results to arbitrary input types beyond integers is not possible: for indivisible input elements, we can prove the same Ω(n2/S) lower bound for sorting in our model.#R##N##R##N#En route, we develop linear-time in-place algorithms to extract leading bits of the input array and to compress and decompress strings with low entropy; these techniques may be of independent interest."
599549,15514,23684,Simultaneous approximations for adversarial and stochastic online budgeted allocation,2012,"Motivated by online ad allocation, we study the problem of simultaneous approximations for the adversarial and stochastic online budgeted allocation problem. This problem consists of a bipartite graph G = (X, Y, E), where the nodes of Y along with their corresponding capacities are known beforehand to the algorithm, and the nodes of X arrive online. When a node of X arrives, its incident edges, and their respective weights are revealed, and the algorithm can match it to a neighbor in Y. The objective is to maximize the weight of the final matching, while respecting the capacities.#R##N##R##N#When nodes arrive in an adversarial order, the best competitive ratio is known to be 1 - 1/e, and it can be achieved by the Ranking [18], and its generalizations (Balance [16, 21]). On the other hand, if the nodes arrive through a random permutation, it is possible to achieve a competitive ratio of 1 -- e [9]. In this paper we design algorithms that achieve a competitive ratio better than 1 -- 1/e on average, while preserving a nearly optimal worst case competitive ratio. Ideally, we want to achieve the best of both worlds, i.e, to design an algorithm with the optimal competitive ratio in both the adversarial and random arrival models. We achieve this for unweighted graphs, but show that it is not possible for weighted graphs.#R##N##R##N#In particular, for unweighted graphs, under some mild assumptions, we show that Balance achieves a competitive ratio of 1 -- e in a random permutation model. For weighted graphs, however, we prove this is not possible; we prove that no online algorithm that achieves an approximation factor of 1 -- 1/e for the worst-case inputs may achieve an average approximation factor better than 97.6% for random inputs. In light of this hardness result, we aim to design algorithms with improved approximation ratios in the random arrival model while preserving the competitive ratio of 1 -- 1/e in the worst case. To this end, we show the algorithm proposed by [21] achieves a competitive ratio of 0.76 for the random arrival model, while having a 1 -- 1/e ratio in the worst case."
1470556,15514,23735,Contactless deflection sensing of concave and convex shapes assisted by soft mirrors,2012,"Typical deflection sensors like strain gauges or devices based on optical fibers require physical contact with the deflected substrate during the measurement process. Such contact, however, impacts on the softness of the substrate and may falsify the measurements. In order to overcome this drawback, a novel method of contactless deflection sensing was proposed in a recent work. It was verified that the deflection angle between two planes can be extracted using only a photosensor and a light source bearing a bell-shape angular emission profile. Yet, the range of operation was limited to concave shapes. In this paper, we introduce an alternative configuration of this light-based deflection sensing method to extend its functionality to convex surfaces. Here, a spheroidal mirror bearing a customized profile is introduced above the light source. This mirror redirects part of the emitted light towards the photosensor occluded by the bending surface during convex deflections.We make use of a ray tracing simulation method to design the mirror profiles, which are accurately reproduced in the manufactured prototypes by tuning the fabrication variables of the manufacturing process. Using a shape-sensing prototype, it is verified that the use of the mirror extends the range of detectable deflections by 55° to convex bendings, yielding a deviation of only 8.3% from simulated results. Our deflection sensing solution is a promising method to be used as a shape sensor in numerous applications, such as soft robotics platforms or prosthetic devices."
948827,15514,23735,Linear multi-modal actuation through discrete coupling,2012,"Due to technological limitations robot actuators are often designed for specific tasks with narrow performance goals, whereas a wide range of output and behaviours is necessary for robots to operate autonomously in uncertain complex environments. We present a design framework that employs dynamic couplings in the form of brakes and clutches to increase the performance and diversity of linear actuators. The couplings are used to switch between a diverse range of discrete modes of operation within a single actuator. We also provide a design solution for miniaturized couplings that use dry friction to produce rapid switching and high braking forces. The couplings are designed so that once engaged or disengaged no extra energy is consumed. We apply the design framework and coupling design to a linear series elastic actuator (SEA) and show that this relatively simple implementation increases the performance and adds new behaviours to the standard design. Through a number of performance tests we are able to show rapid switching between a high and a low impedance output mode; that the actuator's spring can be charged to produce short bursts of high output power; and that the actuator has additional passive and rigid modes that consume no power once activated. Robots using actuators from this design framework would see a vast increase in their behavioural diversity and improvements in their performance not yet possible with conventional actuator design."

A relative positioning system for a MAV needs to satisfy severe constraints in terms of size, weight, processing power, power consumption, three-dimensional coverage and price. In this paper we present an on-board audio based system that is capable of providing individuals with relative positioning information of their neighbouring sound emitting MAVs. We propose a method based on coherence testing among signals of a small onboard microphone array to obtain relative bearing measurements, and a particle filter estimator to fuse these measurements with information about the motion of robots throughout time to obtain the desired relative location estimates. A method based on fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) is used to identify and extract sounds of simultaneous chirping robots in the neighbourhood. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed method in a real world experiment with three simultaneously flying micro air vehicles."
1204368,15514,23634,Settling the APX-Hardness Status for Geometric Set Cover,2014,"Weighted geometric set-cover problems arise naturally in several geometric and non-geometric settings (e.g. the breakthrough of Bansal and Pruhs (FOCS 2010) reduces a wide class of machine scheduling problems to weighted geometric set-cover). More than two decades of research has succeeded in settling the (1+e)-approximability status for most geometric set-cover problems, except for four basic scenarios which are still lacking. One is that of weighted disks in the plane for which, after a series of papers, Varadarajan (STOC 2010) presented a clever quasi-sampling technique, which together with improvements by Chan et al(SODA 2012), yielded a O(1)-approximation algorithm. Even for the unweighted case, a PTAS for a fundamental class of objects called pseudodisks (which includes disks, unit-height rectangles, translates of convex sets etc.) is currently unknown. Another fundamental case is weighted halfspaces in R3, for which a PTAS is currently lacking. In this paper, we present a QPTAS for all of these remaining problems. Our results are based on the separator framework of Adamaszek and Wiese (FOCS 2013, SODA 2014), who recently obtained a QPTAS for weighted independent set of polygonal regions. This rules out the possibility that these problems are APX-hard, assuming NP DTIME(2polylog(n)). Together with the recent work of Chan-Grant (CGTA 2014), this settles the APX-hardness status for all natural geometric set-cover problems."
1178857,15514,23735,Pairwise LIDAR calibration using multi-type 3D geometric features in natural scene,2013,"It has become a well-known technology that 3D measurement of a large environment could be achieved by using a number of 2D LIDARs on a mobile platform. In such a system, calibration is essential for making collaborative use of different LIDAR data, while existing methods usually require modifications to the environments, such as putting calibration targets, or rely on special facilities, which is labor intensive and put many restrictions to potential applications. This research aims at developing a calibration method for multiple 2D LIDAR sensing systems, which could be conducted in a general outdoor environment using the features of a nature scene. Special focus is cast on solving the noisy sensing in a complex environment and the occlusions caused by largely different sensor viewpoints. A multi-type geometric feature based calibration algorithm is proposed, which extracts the features such as points, lines, planes and quadrics from the 3D points of each LIDAR sensing. Transformation parameters from each sensor to the frame on a moving platform is estimated by matching the multi-type features. Experiments are conducted using the data sets of an intelligent vehicle platform (POSS-V) through a driving in the campus of Peking University. Results of calibrating two LIDAR sensors with largely different viewpoints are presented, and the accuracy and robustness concerning noisy feature extractions are examined intensively."
849372,15514,65,Assessing affective response of older users to a telepresence robot using a combination of psychophysiological measures,2012,"Telepresence robots can become a beneficial tool in home care assistance and rehabilitation services by helping elderly people to remain in their homes longer. They can represent an additional means to assist older adults and facilitate social interaction by creating a support network through which nursing staff and family members can collaborate. This article describes a feasibility study relatively to the use of such robots in the interaction with elderly people affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The paper aims at assessing the psychophysiological response of such users to the presence of the robotic platform in order to use it as an indication of the level of tolerance toward the platform. To this purpose, we have involved 9 healthy and 8 MCI older adults in the participation of an experimental study where they have been asked to perform repeated interactions with and without the telepresence robot. We based our analysis on a combination of psychological tests to assess anxiety, positive/negative effects of the interaction with the robot, and we performed physiological measurements (heart rate and heart rate variability) to obtain an objective measure of the actual psychological state. Results seem to suggest that the robot presence is satisfactorily tolerated by MCI and that it does not cause adverse effects in term of cardiovascular response, thus encouraging further investigation on telepresence robots for rehabilitation and care experimental studies."
500611,15514,23684,Online steiner tree with deletions,2014,"In the online Steiner tree problem, the input is a set of vertices that appear one-by-one, and we have to maintain a Steiner tree on the current set of vertices. The cost of the tree is the total length of edges in the tree, and we want this cost to be close to the cost of the optimal Steiner tree at all points in time. If we are allowed to only add edges, a tight bound of Θ(log n) on the competitiveness has been known for two decades. Recently it was shown that if we can add one new edge and make one edge swap upon every vertex arrival, we can still maintain a constant-competitive tree online.#R##N##R##N#But what if the set of vertices sees both additions and deletions? Again, we would like to obtain a low-cost Steiner tree with as few edge changes as possible. The original paper of Imase and Waxman (SIAM J. Disc. Math, 4(3): 369--384, 1991) had also considered this model, and it gave an algorithm that made at most O(n3/2) edge changes for the first n requests, and maintained a constant-competitive tree online. In this paper we improve on these results:#R##N##R##N#• We give an online algorithm that maintains a Steiner tree under only deletions: we start off with a set of vertices, and at each time one of the vertices is removed from this set---our Steiner tree no longer has to span this vertex. We give an algorithm that changes only a constant number of edges upon each request, and maintains a constant-competitive tree at all times. Our algorithm uses the primal-dual framework and a global charging argument to carefully make these constant number of changes.#R##N##R##N#• We also give an algorithm that maintains a Steiner tree in the fully-dynamic model (where each request either adds or deletes a vertex). Our algorithm for this setting makes a constant number of changes per request in an amortized sense."
2266393,15514,23684,The complexity of optimal mechanism design,2014,"Myerson's seminal work provides a computationally efficient revenue-optimal auction for selling one item to multiple bidders [18]. Generalizing this work to selling multiple items at once has been a central question in economics and algorithmic game theory, but its complexity has remained poorly understood. We answer this question by showing that a revenue-optimal auction in multi-item settings cannot be found and implemented computationally efficiently, unless ZPP ⊇ P#P. This is true even for a single additive bidder whose values for the items are independently distributed on two rational numbers with rational probabilities. Our result is very general: we show that it is hard to compute any encoding of an optimal auction of any format (direct or indirect, truthful or non-truthful) that can be implemented in expected polynomial time. In particular, under well-believed complexity-theoretic assumptions, revenue-optimization in very simple multi-item settings can only be tractably approximated.#R##N##R##N#We note that our hardness result applies to randomized mechanisms in a very simple setting, and is not an artifact of introducing combinatorial structure to the problem by allowing correlation among item values, introducing combinatorial valuations, or requiring the mechanism to be deterministic (whose structure is readily combinatorial). Our proof is enabled by a flow-interpretation of the solutions of an exponential-size linear program for revenue maximization with an additional supermodularity constraint."
849084,15514,23735,Force and moment generation of fiber-reinforced pneumatic soft actuators,2013,"Soft actuators are found throughout nature from elephant trunks to round worms, demonstrating large specific forces without the need for sliding components. These actuators offer impact resilience, human-safe interaction, versatility of motion, and scalability in size. Biological structures often use a fiber-reinforcement around a fluid filled elastomeric enclosure, in which the elastomeric material will capture the distributed pressure and transfer it to the fibers, which will in turn direct the forces to the ends. We previously discovered an entire domain of fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs), of which McKibben actuators are a small subset. The range of forces and moments possible with FREEs has not been previously investigated. 45 FREE actuators across the span of fiber angle configurations were fabricated and tested. The reaction force and moment of each actuator was determined across a gamut of pressures. Analytical models were generated using a variety of simplifying assumptions. These models were created to provide a closed form expression that models the force and moment data. The models were compared to the experimental values to determine their fit; this provides an understanding of which simplifying kinematic assumptions best represent the experimental results. Interpolated experimental results and the analytical models are all graphically represented for use as an intuitive design tool."
1249692,15514,23634,Maximum Edge-Disjoint Paths in Planar Graphs with Congestion 2,2011,"We study the maximum edge-disjoint path problem (MEDP) in planar graphs. We are given a set of terminal pairs and wish to find a maximum routable subset of demands. That is, a subset of demands that can be connected by edge-disjoint paths. It is well-known that there is an integrality gap of order square root of the number of nodes for this problem even on a grid-like graph, and hence in planar graphs (Garg et al.). In contrast, Chekuri et al. show that for planar graphs, if LP is the optimal solution to the natural linear programming relaxation for MEDP, then there is a subset of size OPT over the logarithm of the number of nodes which is routable with congestion 2. Subsequently they showed that it is possible to get within a constant factor of the optimal solution with congestion 4 instead of 2. We strengthen this latter result to show that a constant approximation is possible also with congestion 2 (and this is tight via the integrality gap grid example). We use a basic framework from work by Chekuri et al. At the heart of their approach is a 2-phase algorithm that selects an Okamura-Seymour instance. Each of their phases incurs a factor 2 congestion. It is possible to reduce one of the phases to have congestion 1. In order to achieve an overall congestion 2, however, the two phases must share capacity more carefully. For the Phase 1 problem, we extract a problem called rooted clustering that appears to be an interesting problem class in itself."
1481560,15514,23735,Haptic localization and shape recognition of Nano Objects,2012,"Manipulations of submicron objects on a surface with a scanning force probe required a precise localization and shape recognition in order to perform controlled displacements and/or actions on them. As these submicron objects are closed to the optical detection limit of classical optical microscopy, we propose to combine an AFM tip mounted on a quartz tuning fork resonator and a high performance haptic system. The whole system acts as a nano-finger/tool. In this paper two main configurations of the haptic coupling have been tested: (1) a full manual control configuration where the operator pilots manually the AFM probe displacements in (X,Y,Z) directions and then feels and adjusts the tip-surface interaction, (2) a collaborative human-robot configuration where the operator pilots only (X,Y) directions while the standard feedback loop of the AFM probe controls the tip-sample interaction to keep it constant. In both cases, the experimentalist successes in a localization task while in the recognition task the assisted configuration (2) only provides reliable and reproducible results without tip damage. A critical analysis of the results and the haptic recognition process is reported in the last section to discuss about the haptic representation based only on the vertical direction while the common and classical representation is based on the normal direction of the sample surface. Finally a third configuration to pass from localization and recognition mode to nano-manipulation mode is proposed."
385609,15514,23684,Exact distance oracles for planar graphs,2012,"We present new and improved data structures that answer exact node-to-node distance queries in planar graphs. Such data structures are also known as distance oracles. For any directed planar graph on n nodes with non-negative lengths we obtain the following:#R##N##R##N#• Given a desired space allocation S e [n lg lg n, n2], we show how to construct in O(S) time a data structure of size O(S) that answers distance queries in O(n/√ S) time per query. The best distance oracles for planar graphs until the current work are due to Cabello (SODA 2006), Chen and Xu (STOC 2000), Djidjev (WG 1996), and Fakcharoenphol and Rao (FOCS 2001). For σ e (1, 4/3) and space S = nσ, we essentially improve the query time from n2/S to √n2/S.#R##N##R##N#• As a consequence, we obtain an improvement over the fastest algorithm for k-many distances in planar graphs whenever k e [√n, n).#R##N##R##N#• We provide a linear-space exact distance oracle for planar graphs with query time O(n1/2+e) for any constant e > 0. This is the first such data structure with provable sublinear query time.#R##N##R##N#• For edge lengths ≥ 1, we provide an exact distance oracle of space O(n) such that for any pair of nodes at distance l the query time is O(min{l, √ n}). Comparable query performance had been observed experimentally but could not be explained theoretically.#R##N##R##N#Our data structures with superlinear space are based on the following new tool: given a non-self-crossing cycle C with c = O(√n) nodes, we can preprocess G in O(n) time to produce a data structure of size O(n lg lg c) that can answer the following queries in O(c) time: for a query node u, output the distance from u to all the nodes of C. This data structure builds on and provides an alternative for a related data structure of Klein (SODA 2005), which reports distances to the boundary of a face, rather than a cycle."

The goal is to find an assignment of values to the variables that minimises the sum.#R##N##R##N#We study (assuming that PTIME ≠ NP) how the complexity of this very general problem depends on the functions allowed in the instances.

We identify a new infinite family of conditions that includes bisubmodularity as a special case and which can collectively be called skew bisubmodularity. By a recent result of Thapper and Zivný, this condition implies that the corresponding VCSP can be solved by linear programming.#R##N##R##N#We prove that submodularity with respect to a total order and skew bisubmodularity give rise to the only tractable cases, and, in all other cases, again, Max Cut can be expressed. We also show that our characterisation of tractable cases is tight, that is, none of the conditions can be omitted. Thus, our results provide a new dichotomy theorem in constraint satisfaction research, and lead to a whole series of intriguing open problems in submodularity research."
1646747,15514,23735,Multi-robot exploration of unknown environments with identification of exploration completion and post-exploration rendezvous using ant algorithms,2013,"This paper presents a new ant algorithm for the navigation of several robots, whose objective is to autonomously explore an unknown environment. When the coverage is completed, all robots move to a previously defined meeting point. The approach that we propose in this paper for solving this problem, considers that the robots build, while moving, a common and shared representation of the environment. In this representation, the environment is viewed as a graph (typically a set of connected cells in a regular grid), each grid cell having a local memory able to store a limited amount of data. A robot can write numbers on the cell on which it is lying. It can also read the values of the cells in its neighborhood, and perform some simple operations, such as computing the minimum of a set of values. Each robot is capable, contrary to most ant-based approaches, to determine, in a distributed way, when the environment coverage has completed. Few ant algorithms can do that. Brick&Mortar is one of them and this is why it retains a central place in our proposition. The novelty of our approach is that, due to an emerging property of the underlying algorithm, agents will finish their exploration at a predefined evacuation point. In addition, several improvements of the original Brick&Mortar algorithm are proposed in this paper, such as the possibility to use better local strategies at the robot level (using, for example, LRTA*). The paper also presents a set of benchmarks against the best existing ant algorithms on several widespread graph topologies."
2627543,15514,20358,Truthful incentives in crowdsourcing tasks using regret minimization mechanisms,2013,"What price should be offered to a worker for a task in an online labor market? How can one enable workers to express the amount they desire to receive for the task completion? Designing optimal pricing policies and determining the right monetary incentives is central to maximizing requester's utility and workers' profits. Yet, current crowdsourcing platforms only offer a limited capability to the requester in designing the pricing policies and often rules of thumb are used to price tasks. This limitation could result in inefficient use of the requester's budget or workers becoming disinterested in the task.   In this paper, we address these questions and present mechanisms using the approach of regret minimization in online learning. We exploit a link between procurement auctions and multi-armed bandits to design mechanisms that are budget feasible, achieve near-optimal utility for the requester, are incentive compatible (truthful) for workers and make minimal assumptions about the distribution of workers' true costs. Our main contribution is a novel, no-regret posted price mechanism, BP-UCB, for budgeted procurement in stochastic online settings. We prove strong theoretical guarantees about our mechanism, and extensively evaluate it in simulations as well as on real data from the Mechanical Turk platform. Compared to the state of the art, our approach leads to a 180% increase in utility."
1886441,15514,23735,Predictive compliance for interaction control of robot manipulators,2011,"This paper presents the use of context-based predictions for the selection and on-line modification of the compliance of a robot manipulator. The work is partially inspired on current neuroscience hypotheses about the control of the human arm and the computational processes used by the brain. A first experiment uses inspiration from the classical neuroscience experiment of the Waiter Task. In the original experiment, the non-dominant human arm is holding a weight of 1 Kg. When this weight is unloaded by a self-generated action (with the dominant arm), it is observed that the non-dominant arm does not suffer perceptible postural changes. The reason arguably stems from the prediction of the forces occurring at the unloading, since the inherently delayed sensory feedback present in biological systems would not suffice to react in such a short notice as observed. The experiment is reproduced in a robotic platform by means of forward models and compliance adaption via stiffness control as speculated in neuroscience hypotheses. A second experiment uses context-based predictions to modify on-line the compliance of the robot manipulator. For this task, a Bayesian predictor in the form of a Relevance Vector Machine combines the use of prior knowledge and expected sensory feedback to correct for an erroneous compliance in the case of a falsely-predicted context. The results are combined in an architecture called Predictive Context-Based Adaptive Compliance (PCAC)."
243179,15514,23684,"Complexity of SAT problems, clone theory and the exponential time hypothesis",2013,"The construction of exact exponential-time algorithms for NP-complete problems has for some time been a very active research area. Unfortunately, there is a lack of general methods for studying and comparing the time complexity of algorithms for such problems. We propose such a method based on clone theory and demonstrate it on the SAT problem. Schaefer has completely classified the complexity of SAT with respect to the set of allowed relations and proved that this parameterized problem exhibits a dichotomy: it is either in P or is NP-complete. We show that there is a certain partial order on the NP-complete SAT problems with a close connection to their worst-case time complexities; if a problem SAT(S) is below a problem SAT(S') in this partial order, then SAT(S') cannot be solved strictly faster than SAT(S). By using this order, we identify a relation R such that SAT({R}) is the computationally easiest NP-complete SAT(S') problem. This result may be interesting when investigating the borderline between P and NP since one appealing way of studying this borderline is to identify problems that, in some sense, are situated close to it (such as a 'very hard' problem in P or a 'very easy' NP-complete problem). We strengthen the result by showing that SAT({R})-2 (i.e. SAT({R}) restricted to instances where no variable appears more than twice) is NP-complete, too. This is in contrast to, for example, 1-in-3-SAT (or even CNF-SAT), which is in P under the same restriction. We then relate SAT({R})-2 to the exponential-time hypothesis (ETH) and show that ETH holds if and only if SAT({R})-2 is not sub-exponential. This constitutes a strong connection between ETH and the SAT problem under both severe relational and severe structural restrictions, and it may thus serve as a tool for studying the borderline between sub-exponential and exponential problems. In the process, we also prove a stronger version of Impagliazzo et al.'s sparsification lemma for k-SAT; namely that all finite Boolean constraint languages S and S' such that SAT(·) is NP-complete can be sparsified into each other. This should be compared with Santhanam and Srinivasan's recent negative result which states that the same does not hold for all infinite Boolean constraint languages."
2240762,15514,23735,Active camera control with obstacle avoidance for remote operations with industrial manipulators: Implementation and experimental results,2011,"Remote controlled robots on offshore oil and gas platforms can potentially reduce costs and improve environment, health and safety issues. A key to successful remote control is to provide onshore operators with a sufficient overview of the processes offshore. To this end, robot manipulators constitute flexible camera platforms, compared to e.g. simple pan-tilt units, for monitoring offshore operations. In this paper, we present a system solution and experimental results for real-time active camera control with obstacle avoidance for industrial manipulators based on weighted pseudoinverse redundancy resolution method. We extend the pseudoinverse solution for joint limit avoidance in combination with obstacle avoidance such that joint limits are gracefully avoided. A novel choice of stereographic projection provides robustness with respect to global stability and singularities. Implementation issues are addressed and the monitoring approach is experimentally validated on two Kuka KR-16 robot manipulators. Experimental results show that a follower robot with a camera is able to monitor and track a leader robot while simultaneously avoiding collisions. In addition, a robot control system architecture which ensures efficient and safe testing of new Matlab-implemented robot controllers is presented."
1580859,15514,122,Parallel suffix array and least common prefix for the GPU,2013,"Suffix Array (SA) is a data structure formed by sorting the suffixes of a string into lexicographic order. SAs have been used in a variety of applications, most notably in pattern matching and Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) based lossless data compression. SAs have also become the data structure of choice for many, if not all, string processing problems to which suffix tree methodology is applicable. Over the last two decades researchers have proposed many suffix array construction algorithm (SACAs). We do a systematic study of the main classes of SACAs with the intent of mapping them onto a data parallel architecture like the GPU. We conclude that  skew algorithm  [12], a linear time recursive algorithm, is the best candidate for GPUs as all its phases can be efficiently mapped to a data parallel hardware. Our OpenCL implementation of  skew algorithm  achieves a throughput of up to 25 MStrings/sec and a speedup of up to 34x and 5.8x over a single threaded CPU implementation using a discrete GPU and APU respectively. We also compare our OpenCL implementation against the fastest known CPU implementation based on  induced copying  and achieve a speedup of up to 3.7x. Using SA we construct BWT on GPU and achieve a speedup of 11x over the fastest known BWT on GPU.   Suffix arrays are often augmented with the longest common prefix (LCP) information. We design a novel high-performance parallel algorithm for computing LCP on the GPU. Our GPU implementation of LCP achieves a speedup of up to 25x and 4.3x on discrete GPU and APU respectively."

We demonstrate the utility of our method by providing a new SDP-hierarchy based algorithm for constraint satisfaction problems with 2-variable constraints (2-CSP's). More concretely, we show for every $2$-CSP instance $\Ins$, a rounding algorithm for $r$ rounds of the Lasserre SDP hierarchy for $\Ins$ that obtains an integral solution which is at most $\e$ worse than the relaxation's value (normalized to lie in $[0,1]$), as long as\[ r g,\]where $k$ is the alphabet size of $\Ins$, $\theta=\poly(\e/k)$, and $\rank_{\geq \theta}(\Ins)$ denotes the number of eigen values larger than $\theta$ in the normalized adjacency matrix of the constraint graph of $\Ins$. In the case that $\Ins$ is a \unique games instance, the threshold $\theta$ is only a polynomial in $\e$, and is independent of the alphabet size. Also in this case, we can give a non-trivial bound on the number of rounds for \emph{every} instance. In particular our result yields an SDP-hierarchy based algorithm that matches the performance of the recent sub exponential algorithm of Aurora, Barak and Steurer (FOCS 2010) in the worst case, but runs faster on a natural family of instances, thus further restricting the set of possible hard instances for Khot's Unique Games Conjecture. Our algorithm actually requires less than the $n^{O(r)}$ constraints specified by the $r^{th}$ level of the Lasserre hierarchy, and in some cases $r$ rounds of our program can be evaluated in time$2^{O(r)}\poly(n)$."
1310510,15514,23634,A Direct Product Theorem for the Two-Party Bounded-Round Public-Coin Communication Complexity,2012,"A strong direct product theorem for a problem in a given model of computation states that, in order to compute k instances of the problem, if we provide resource which is less than k times the resource required for computing one instance of the problem with constant success probability, then the probability of correctly computing all the k instances together, is exponentially small in k. In this paper, we consider the model of two-party bounded-round public-coin randomized communication complexity. We show a direct product theorem for the communication complexity of any relation in this model. In particular, our result implies a strong direct product theorem for the two-party constant-message public-coin randomized communication complexity of all relations. As an immediate application of our result, we get a strong direct product theorem for the pointer chasing problem. This problem has been well studied for understanding round v/s communication trade-offs in both classical and quantum communication protocols. Our result generalizes the result of Jain [2011] which can be regarded as the special case when t=1. Our result can be considered as an important progress towards settling the strong direct product conjecture for the two-party public-coin communication complexity, a major open question in this area. We show our result using information theoretic arguments. Our arguments and techniques build on the ones used in Jain~\cite{Jain:2011}. %, where a strong direct product theorem for the %two-party one-way public-coin communication complexity of all %relations is shown (that is the special case of our result when $t=1$). One key tool used in our work and also in Jain~\cite{Jain:2011} is a message compression technique due to Braver man and Rao~\cite{Braverman2011}, who used it to show a {\em direct sum} theorem in the same model of communication complexity as considered by us. Another important tool that we use is a correlated sampling protocol, which for example, has been used in Holenstein~\cite{Holenstein2007} for proving a parallel repetition theorem for two-prover games."
1226761,15514,23735,Aerodynamic evaluation of four butterfly species for the design of flapping-gliding robotic insects,2012,"Alternating gliding and active propulsion is a potentially energy saving strategy for small-scale flight. With the goal of finding optimal wing shapes for flapping-gliding robots we evaluate the quasi-steady aerodynamic performance of four butterfly species (Monarch (Danaus plexippus), the Orange Aeroplane (Pantoporia consimilis), the Glasswing (Acraea andromacha) and the Four-barred Swordtail (Protographium Ieosthenes)). We fabricate at-scale wing models based on measured wing shapes and vary the forewing angle in nine steps to account for the ability of the butterfly to change the relative orientation of its forewing and hindwing during flight. For comparison we include twelve non-biological planforms as performance benchmarks for the butterfly wing shapes. We then test these 48 wing models at 2m/s, 3.5m/s and 5m/s (Reynolds number between 2597 and 12632) in a low speed wind tunnel which allows lift and drag force measurements of centimeter-size wings. The results indicate that the forewing orientation which maximizes the wing span offers the best gliding performance and that overall the gliding ratios are highest at 3.5m/s. The wing shapes with the best gliding ratio are found in the Glasswing butterfly with a maximum of 6.26 which is very high compared to the gliding performance of similarly sized flying robots. The results from this study are important for the development of novel biologically-inspired flying micro robots as well as for biomechanics studies in biology."
873679,15514,23735,Snake robot shape sensing using micro-inertial sensors,2013,"Real-time shape sensing and state acquisition is important for closed-loop control of hyper-redundant snake robots in minimally invasive surgery. Due to the miniaturized size of such minimally invasive surgery robots, it is not feasible to use existing angular sensors involving rotary encoders. With recent advances of the MEMS technology, micro inertial sensors have shown their potential for robot state estimation. Previous studies have demonstrated that accurate joint angles can be estimated for one degree-of-freedom (DoF) joints. However, higher DoF joints of the robot can impose a number of challenges to the current joint angle estimation methods. This paper presents a micro-sensing platform and shape reconstruction algorithm for minimally invasive surgery snake robot with two DoF joints. The method incorporates both gravitational and gyroscopic sensing for calculating the rotation difference between any consecutive robot segments. The gyroscope measurements are first used as the input to predict the rotation difference by direct orientation integration. The orientation difference is then derived from the consecutive acceleration vectors to update the prediction through a complementary filter. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed approach, a robot prototype with two universal joints was fabricated. Detailed experimental results have demonstrated that high accuracy can be achieved by using the proposed method for joint angle estimation."
737305,15514,23735,Ninja legs: Amphibious one degree of freedom robotic legs,2013,"In this paper we propose a design of a class of robotic legs (known as “Ninja legs”) that enable amphibious operation, both walking and swimming, for use on a class of hexapod robots. Amphibious legs equip the robot with a capability to explore diverse locations in the world encompassing both those that are on the ground as well as underwater. In this paper we work with a hexapod robot of the Aqua vehicle family (based on a body plan first developed by Buehler et al. [1]), which is an amphibious robot that employs legs for amphibious locomotion. Many different leg designs have been previously developed for Aqua-class vehicles, including both robust all-terrain legs for walking, and efficient flippers for swimming. But the walking legs have extremely poor thrust for swimming and the flippers are completely unsuitable for terrestrial operations. In this work we propose a single leg design with the advantages of both the walking legs and the swimming flippers. We design a cage-like circular enclosure for the flippers in order to protect the flippers during terrestrial operations. The enclosing structure also plays the role of the walking legs for terrestrial locomotion. The circular shape of the enclosure, as well, has the advantages of an offset wheel. We evaluate the performance of our design for terrestrial mobility by comparing the power efficiency and the physical speed of the robot equipped with the newly designed legs against that with the walking legs which are semi-circular in shape. The swimming performance is examined by measuring the thrust generated by newly designed legs and comparing the same with the thrust generated by the swimming flippers. In the field, we also verified that these legs are suitable for swimming through moderate surf, walking through the breakers on a beach (and thus through slurry), and onto wet and dry sand."
555760,15514,23922,Computational Limits for Matrix Completion,2014,"Matrix Completion is the problem of recovering an unknown real-valued low-rank matrix from a subsample of its entries. Important recent results show that the problem can be solved efficiently under the assumption that the unknown matrix is incoherent and the subsample is drawn uniformly at random. Are these assumptions necessary? #R##N#It is well known that Matrix Completion in its full generality is NP-hard. However, little is known if make additional assumptions such as incoherence and permit the algorithm to output a matrix of slightly higher rank. In this paper we prove that Matrix Completion remains computationally intractable even if the unknown matrix has rank $4$ but we are allowed to output any constant rank matrix, and even if additionally we assume that the unknown matrix is incoherent and are shown $90%$ of the entries. This result relies on the conjectured hardness of the $4$-Coloring problem. We also consider the positive semidefinite Matrix Completion problem. Here we show a similar hardness result under the standard assumption that $\mathrm{P}\ne \mathrm{NP}.$ #R##N#Our results greatly narrow the gap between existing feasibility results and computational lower bounds. In particular, we believe that our results give the first complexity-theoretic justification for why distributional assumptions are needed beyond the incoherence assumption in order to obtain positive results. On the technical side, we contribute several new ideas on how to encode hard combinatorial problems in low-rank optimization problems. We hope that these techniques will be helpful in further understanding the computational limits of Matrix Completion and related problems."

This paper describes a microrobotic force-feedback based system and its application to the mechanical characterization of living, growing plant cells. The Cellular Force Microscope (CFM) is capable of performing the automated mechanical characterization of living plant cells in situ as these cells proliferate and grow. The microrobotic measurement system employs a single-axis capacitive MEMS microforce sensor capable of resolving forces down to 20 nN (1σ, at 10Hz). A multi-axis positioning system with 5 nm resolution position feedback is integrated into a complete system with a high-resolution optical microscope and a custom user interface for guiding an automated force-based measurement process. The CFM has been applied to characterize the mechanical properties of 20µm wide Lilium pollen tubes while they grow at a rate of about 10 µm/min in growth medium. For the mechanical characterization of pollen tubes, loads up to 400 nN are applied that cause indentations up to 300 nm. The force-deformation data acquired show an increase in the observed stiffness from the tip to the apex demonstrating that CFM is a promising tool for better understanding the changing mechanics of living plant cell growth."
2401683,15514,23735,Shape-based depth image to 3D model matching and classification with inter-view similarity,2011,"Object recognition and especially object class recognition is and will be a key capability in home robotics when robots have to tackle manipulation tasks and grasp new objects or just have to search for objects. The goal is to have a robot classify 'never before seen objects' at first occurrence in a single view in a fast and robust manner. The classification task can be seen as a matching problem, finding the most appropriate 3D model and view with respect to a given depth image. We introduce a single-view shape model based classification approach using RGB-D sensors and a novel matching procedure for depth image to 3D model matching leading inherently to object classification. Utilizing the inter-view similarity of the 3D models for enhanced matching, the average precision of our descriptors is increased of up to 15% resulting in high classification accuracy. The presented adaptation of 3D shape descriptors to 2.5D data enables us to calculate the features in real time, directly from the 3D points of the sensor, without any calculation of normals or generating a mesh from it which is typical of state-of-art methods. Furthermore, we introduce a semi-automatic, user-centric approach to utilize the Internet for acquiring the required training data in the form of 3D models which significantly reduces the time for teaching new categories."
1806242,15514,23735,EMG-based teleoperation and manipulation with the DLR LWR-III,2011,"In this paper we describe and practically demonstrate a robotic arm/hand system that is controlled in realtime in 6D Cartesian space through measured human muscular activity. The soft-robotics control architecture of the robotic system ensures safe physical human robot interaction as well as stable behaviour while operating in an unstructured environment. Muscular control is realised via surface electromyography, a non-invasive and simple way to gather human muscular activity from the skin. A standard supervised machine learning system is used to create a map from muscle activity to hand position, orientation and grasping force which then can be evaluated in real time—the existence of such a map is guaranteed by gravity compensation and low-speed movement. No kinematic or dynamic model of the human arm is necessary, which makes the system quickly adaptable to anyone. Numerical validation shows that the system achieves good movement precision. Live evaluation and demonstration of the system during a robotic trade fair is reported and confirms the validity of the approach, which has potential applications in muscle-disorder rehabilitation or in teleoperation where a close-range, safe master/slave interaction is required, and/or when optical/magnetic position tracking cannot be enforced."
1785410,15514,65,Dynamic Mode Decomposition for perturbation estimation in human robot interaction,2014,"In many settings, e.g. physical human-robot interaction, robotic behavior must be made robust against more or less spontaneous application of external forces. Typically, this problem is tackled by means of special purpose force sensors which are, however, not available on many robotic platforms. In contrast, we propose a machine learning approach suitable for more common, although often noisy sensors. This machine learning approach makes use of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) which is able to extract the dynamics of a nonlinear system. It is therefore well suited to separate noise from regular oscillations in sensor readings during cyclic robot movements under different behavior configurations. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with an example where physical forces are exerted on a humanoid robot during walking. In a training phase, a snapshot based DMD model for behavior specific parameter configurations is learned. During task execution the robot must detect and estimate the external forces exerted by a human interaction partner. We compare the DMD-based approach to other interpolation schemes and show that the former outperforms the latter particularly in the presence of sensor noise. We conclude that DMD which has so far been mostly used in other fields of science, particularly fluid mechanics, is also a highly promising method for robotics."
214129,15514,22113,Approximating optimal combinatorial auctions for complements using restricted welfare maximization,2011,"The VCG mechanism is the gold standard for combinatorial auctions (CAs), and it maximizes social welfare. In contrast, the revenue-maximizing (aka optimal) CA is unknown, and designing one is NP-hard. Therefore, research on optimal CAs has progressed into special settings. Notably, Levin [1997] derived the optimal CA for complements when each agent's private type is one-dimensional. (This does not fall inside the well-studied single-parameter environment.) We introduce a new research avenue for increasing revenue where we poke holes in the allocation space--based on the bids--and then use a welfare-maximizing allocation rule within the remaining allocation set. In this paper, the first step down this avenue, we introduce a new form of reserve pricing into CAs. We show that Levin's optimal revenue can be 2-approximated by using monopoly reserve prices to curtail the allocation set, followed by welfare-maximizing allocation and Levin's payment rule. A key lemma of potential independent interest is that the expected revenue from any truthful allocation-monotonic mechanism equals the expected virtual valuation; this generalizes Myerson's lemma [1981] from the single-parameter environment. Our mechanism is close to the gold standard and thus easier to adopt than Levin's. It also requires less information about the prior over the bidders' types, and is always more efficient. Finally, we show that the optimal revenue can be 6- approximated even if the reserve pricing is required to be symmetric across bidders."
1860561,15514,8228,Doped LT Decoding with Application to Wireless Broadcast Service,2011,"In this paper, we consider the doped decoder for Luby-Transform (LT) codes, where based on the decoder feed- back, the decoding process is revived by retransmission of the in- formation packet. We propose several improved doping methods to reduce the average doping rate. We then provide an analysis of the proposed doping methods based on the study of the decoding ripple evolution. Both analytical and simulation results show that the proposed doping approaches provide significant performance gain over the existing random doping strategy. We then apply the doped LT decoding to the wireless broadcast system in which limited feedback is allowed. We propose a majority vote based doping selection and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed doping selection through simulations. I. INTRODUCTION Rateless codes, e.g., Luby-Transform (LT) codes (1), are commonly used for data transmission without any feedback. However, if limited feedback is allowed, the data recovery per- formance can be improved. Some works that have considered rateless codes over a feedback channel include (2) and (3). In (2), rateless coding with feedback is proposed in the form of hybrid automatic repeat request (ARQ), called doped rateless decoding. On the other hand, in (3), the transmitter adjusts the degree distributions of the LT code to improve performance based on the feedback of the number of correctly decoded bits. In this paper, following (2), we propose several improved doping methods for LT codes to reduce the number of doping iterations (or the doping rate) required for correct decoding. Based on the code structure and degree information, the doped input symbol is deliberately selected which potentially adds more bits to the decoding ripple. Following the Markov- modulated random walk model in (2), we provide performance analysis for the proposed doping methods. Moreover, we apply doped LT decoding to wireless broadcast systems in which the same data stream is sent to multiple receivers. We propose a majority voting based selection and several other criterions at the transmit side for the broadcast systems in conjunction with the proposed doping approaches at the receivers."
2217003,15514,65,Abstract robots with an attitude: Applying interpersonal relation models to human-robot interaction,2013,"This paper explores new possibilities for social interaction between a human user and a robot with an abstract shape. The social interaction takes place by simulating behaviors such as submissiveness and dominance and analyzing the corresponding human reactions. We used an object that has no resemblance with human features in its shape or expression mode, in order to exclude the effect of these features on the human behavior. An intelligent walk-in closet was made to behave either dominantly or submissively using lighting effects. The behaviors of the closet were rated by participants using the Bem Sex Role Inventory in a pilot study, resulting in the selection of one submissive and one dominant lighting behavior for the closet. Participants' personality was measured using the Social Dominance Orientation questionnaire. These data were then compared to measurements of user satisfaction and feelings of dominance, arousal, and valence after scenario completion. A surprising effect was revealed as participants with a dominant personality reported feeling submissive to a dominant system, while in comparison, persons with a submissive personality felt more dominant in the same condition. Furthermore, it was found that a submissive system was generally more preferred by users. We draw a careful conclusion that people interact differently with systems that show human-like attitudes, than they would in response to similar attitude expressed by other person. These findings need to be investigated further with dominant/submissive nonverbal behaviors that are then simulated on a humanoid robot."
1621705,15514,23634,Preventing False Discovery in Interactive Data Analysis Is Hard,2014,"We show that, under a standard hardness assumption, there is no computationally efficient algorithm that given n samples from an unknown distribution can give valid answers to n3+o(1) adaptively chosen statistical queries. A statistical query asks for the expectation of a predicate over the underlying distribution, and an answer to a statistical query is valid if it is close to the correct expectation over the distribution. Our result stands in stark contrast to the well known fact that exponentially many statistical queries can be answered validly and efficiently if the queries are chosen non-adaptively (no query may depend on the answers to previous queries). Moreover, Dwork et al. [1], showed how to accurately answer exponentially many adaptively chosen statistical queries via a computationally inefficient algorithm. They also gave efficient algorithm that can answer nearly n2 adaptively chosen queries, which shows our result is almost quantitatively tight. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that achieving statistical validity alone can be a source of computational intractability in adaptive settings. For example, in the modern large collaborative research environment, data analysts typically choose a particular approach based on previous findings. False discovery occurs if a research finding is supported by the data but not by the underlying distribution. While the study of preventing false discovery in Statistics is decades old, to the best of our knowledge our result is the first to demonstrate a computational barrier. In particular, our result suggests that the perceived difficulty of preventing false discovery in today's collaborative research environment may be inherent."
1911509,15514,23735,Logic programming with simulation-based temporal projection for everyday robot object manipulation,2011,"In everyday object manipulation tasks, like making a pancake, autonomous robots are required to decide on the appropriate action parametrizations in order to achieve desired (and to avoid undesired) outcomes. For determining the right parameters for actions like pouring a pancake mix onto a pancake maker, robots need capabilities to predict the physical consequences of their own manipulation actions. In this work, we integrate a simulation-based approach for making temporal projections for robot manipulation actions into the logic programming language PROLOG. The realized system enables robots to determine action parameters that bring about certain effects by utilizing simulation-based temporal projections within PROLOG's chronological backtracking mechanism. For a set of formal parameters and their respective ranges of values, the developed system translates the manipulation problems into physical simulations, monitors and logs the relevant data structures of the simulations, translates the logged data back into first-order time-interval-based representations, called timelines, and eventually evaluates the individual timelines with respect to specified performance criteria. Integrating the proposed approach into robot control programs allow robots to mentally simulate the consequences of different action parametrizations before committing to them and thereby to reduce the number of undesired outcomes."
1915498,15514,23684,Ranking on arbitrary graphs: rematch via continuous LP with monotone and boundary condition constraints,2014,"Motivated by online advertisement and exchange settings, greedy randomized algorithms for the maximum matching problem have been studied, in which the algorithm makes (random) decisions that are essentially oblivious to the input graph. Any greedy algorithm can achieve performance ratio 0.5, which is the expected number of matched nodes to the number of nodes in a maximum matching.#R##N##R##N#Since Aronson, Dyer, Frieze and Suen proved that the Modified Randomized Greedy algorithm achieves performance ratio 0.5 + e (where e = 1/400000) on arbitrary graphs in the mid-nineties, no further attempts in the literature have been made to improve this theoretical ratio for arbitrary graphs until two papers were published in FOCS 2012.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, we revisit the Ranking algorithm using the LP framework. Special care is given to analyze the structural properties of the Ranking algorithm in order to derive the LP constraints, of which one known as the boundary constraint requires totally new analysis and is crucial to the success of our LP.#R##N##R##N#We use continuous LP relaxation to analyze the limiting behavior as the finite LP grows. Of particular interest are new duality and complementary slackness characterizations that can handle the monotone and the boundary constraints in continuous LP. Our work achieves the currently best theoretical performance ratio of [EQUATION] on arbitrary graphs. Moreover, experiments suggest that Ranking cannot perform better than 0.724 in general."
556597,15514,23684,"Convergence of multivariate belief propagation, with applications to cuckoo hashing and load balancing",2013,"This paper is motivated by two applications, namely i) generalizations of cuckoo hashing, a computationally simple approach to assigning keys to objects, and ii) load balancing in content distribution networks, where one is interested in determining the impact of content replication on performance. These two problems admit a common abstraction: in both scenarios, performance is characterized by the maximum weight of a generalization of a matching in a bipartite graph, featuring node and edge capacities. Our main result is a law of large numbers characterizing the asymptotic maximum weight matching in the limit of large bipartite random graphs, when the graphs admit a local weak limit that is a tree. This result specializes to the two application scenarios, yielding new results in both contexts. In contrast with previous results, the key novelty is the ability to handle edge capacities with arbitrary integer values. An analysis of belief propagation algorithms (BP) with multivariate belief vectors underlies the proof. In particular, we show convergence of the corresponding BP by exploiting monotonicity of the belief vectors with respect to the so-called upshifted likelihood ratio stochastic order. This auxiliary result can be of independent interest, providing a new set of structural conditions which ensure convergence of BP."
2719961,15514,23684,Minimum makespan scheduling with low rank processing times,2013,"We investigate approximation algorithms for the classical minimum makespan scheduling problem, focusing on instances where the rank of the matrix describing the processing times of the jobs is bounded. A bounded rank matrix arises naturally when the processing time of a job on machine depends upon a bounded set of resources. A bounded rank matrix also shows up when jobs have varying degrees of parallelizability and the machines have multiple cores.#R##N##R##N#We are interested in studying the tractability of the problem as a function of the (positive) rank of the processing-time matrix. At one extreme is the case of unit rank, also known as related machines, which admits a PTAS [7], and at the other extreme is the full rank case (unrelated machines), which is NP-hard to approximate within a factor better than 3/2 [8].#R##N##R##N#Our main technical contribution is in showing that the approximability of the problem is not smooth with the rank of the matrix. From the inapproximability side, we show that the problem becomes APX-hard, even for rank four matrices. For rank seven matrices, we prove that it is hard to approximate to a factor 3/2, matching the inapproximability result for general unrelated machines. From the algorithmic side, we obtain a quasi-polynomial approximation scheme (i.e., a (1 + e) approximation in time npoly(1/e,log n)) for the rank two case. This implies that the problem is not APX-hard in this case, unless NP has quasi-polynomial algorithms. Our algorithm is a subtle dynamic program which runs in polynomial time in some interesting special cases. The classification of the three dimensional problem remains open."
585166,15514,23684,Approximating CSPs with global cardinality constraints using SDP hierarchies,2012,"This work is concerned with approximating constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) with additional global cardinality constraints. For example, Max Cut is a boolean CSP where the input is a graph G = (V, E) and the goal is to find a cut S ∪ S = V that maximizes the number of crossing edges, |E(S, S)|. The Max Bisection problem is a variant of Max Cut with a global constraint that each side of the cut has exactly half the vertices, i.e., |S| = |V|/2. Several other natural optimization problems like Min Bisection and approximating Graph Expansion can be formulated as CSPs with global cardinality constraints.#R##N##R##N#In this work, we formulate a general approach towards approximating CSPs with global cardinality constraints using SDP hierarchies. To demonstrate the approach we present the following results:#R##N##R##N#• Using the Lasserre hierarchy, we present an algorithm that runs in time O(npoly(1/e)) that given an instance of Max Bisection with value 1 − e, finds a bisection with value 1 − O(√e). This approximation is near-optimal (up to constant factors in O()) under the Unique Games Conjecture.#R##N##R##N#• By a computer-assisted proof, we show that the same algorithm also achieves a 0.85-approximation for Max Bisection, improving on the previous bound of 0.70 (note that it is Unique Games hard to approximate better than a 0.878 factor). The same algorithm also yields a 0.92-approximation for Max 2-Sat with cardinality constraints.#R##N##R##N#• For every CSP with a global cardinality constraints, we present a generic conversion from integrality gap instances for the Lasserre hierarchy to a dictatorship test whose soundness is at most integrality gap. Dictatorship testing gadgets are central to hardness results for CSPs, and a generic conversion of the above nature lies at the core of the tight Unique Games based hardness result for CSPs [Rag08]."
2146811,15514,23735,Stereographic projection for industrial manipulator tasks: Theory and experiments,2011,"In this paper, we present a solution and experimental results for real-time control of manipulation tasks considering the alignment of a robots end effector relative to some reference. The developed controller is applicable to industrial manipulators and is based on the pseudoinverse redundancy resolution method. The application considered is the employment of two industrial robots in an offshore remote inspection and maintenance system. A leader robot is controlled freely from onshore, and a follower robot uses an attached camera to provide the onshore operator with live video feed of the ongoing operation. Robot manipulators constitute flexible camera platforms, compared to e.g. simple pan/tilt units, for monitoring offshore operations. We develop a controller for the follower robot such that automatic camera tracking is achieved using pseudoinverse redundancy resolution control. A minimal task space parametrization relying on stereographic projection is constructed which achieves relative end effector alignment tracking without introducing representational or algorithmic singularities. It is shown that singular configurations will only in special cases affect the closed loop behavior. The controller is applicable to tasks such as spray painting or polishing on curved surfaces. The control approach is experimentally validated on two Kuka KR-16 industrial robot manipulators."
978841,15514,23735,Reassessment of COM-ZMP model for the identification of lateral standing controller of a human,2013,"This paper reports the result and discussion about our second experiment of standing motion measurement and analysis. We aim at identifying the standing controller of a human. In order to tackle the dynamical complexity of the human body, the COM-ZMP (the center of mass and the zero-moment point) model, which is widely used for designing the whole-body controller of humanoid robots, and a piecewise-linear controller is applied. In the previous experiment, the authors proposed a method to collect a sufficient number of loci of COM in a phase space for the identification of a controller, and showed that the human's standing behavior qualitatively has a similar property with the COM-ZMP model. It was also found, however, that the collected loci had large variability due to the uncertainty of convergence point and were partially inconsistent with the model, so that it was still difficult to identify the controller. Then, the authors reassessed the model and measurement protocol, and conducted the second experiment in order to improve the reliability of the measurement by visually presenting the referential point to subjects and by redesigning the protocol. As the result, more reliable loci to be processed of identification were obtained. It was also found that the effect of variation of the COM height due to the limitation of leg length, which was thought to be another source of the inconsistency, certainly existed but was not critical to model the human behavior."

A famous example thereof is the classical degree-bounded MST problem, where for every vertex v, a simple upper bound on the degree is imposed. Iterative rounding/relaxation algorithms became the tool of choice for degree-constrained network design problems. A cornerstone for this development was the work of Singh and Lau [19], who showed that for the degree-bounded MST problem, one can find a spanning tree violating each degree bound by at most one unit and with cost at most the cost of an optimal solution that respects the degree bounds.#R##N##R##N#However, current iterative rounding approaches face several limits when dealing with more general degree constraints, where several linear constraints are imposed on the edges adjacent to a vertex v. For example, when a partition of the edges adjacent to v is given and only a fixed number of elements can be chosen out of each set of the partition, current approaches might violate each of the constraints at v by a constant, instead of violating the whole family of constraints at v by at most a constant number of edges. Furthermore, previous iterative rounding approaches are not suited for degree constraints where some edges are in a super-constant number of constraints.#R##N##R##N#We extend iterative rounding/relaxation approaches, both conceptually as well as in their analysis, to address these limitations. Based on these extensions, we present an algorithm for the degree-constrained MST problem where for every vertex v, the edges adjacent to v have to be independent in a given matroid. The algorithm returns a spanning tree of cost at most OPT, such that for every vertex v, it suffices to remove at most 8 edges from the spanning tree to satisfy the matroidal degree constraint at v."
2494015,15514,23735,Descending commands to an insect leg controller network cause smooth behavioral transitions,2011,"Biological inspiration has long been pursued as a key to more efficient, agile and elegant control in robotics. It has been a successful strategy in the design and control of robots with both biologically abstracted and biomimetic designs. Behavioral studies have resulted in a good understanding of the mechanics of certain animals. However, without a better understanding of their nervous systems, the biologically-inspired observation-based approach was limited. The findings of Hess and Buschges, and Ekeberg et al. describing the neural mechanisms of stick insect intra-leg joint coordination have made it possible to control models of insect legs with a network of neural pathways they found in the animal's thoracic ganglia. Our work with this model, further informed by cockroach neurobiological studies performed in the Ritzmann lab, has led to LegConNet (Leg Controller Network). In this paper we show that LegConNet controls the forward stepping motion of a robotic leg. With hypothesized additional pathways, some later confirmed by neurobiology, it can smoothly transition the leg from forward stepping to turning movements. We hypothesize that commands descending from a higher center in the nervous system inhibit or excite appropriate local neural pathways and change thresholds, which, in turn, create a cascade of reflexes resulting in behavioral transitions."
641729,15514,23684,Minimum d -dimensional arrangement with fixed points,2014,"In the Minimum d-Dimensional Arrangement Problem (d-dimAP) we are given a graph with edge weights, and the goal is to find a 1-1 map of the vertices into Zd (for some fixed dimension d ≥ 1) minimizing the total weighted stretch of the edges. This problem arises in VLSI placement and chip design.#R##N##R##N#Motivated by these applications, we consider a generalization of d-dimAP, where the positions of some k of the vertices (pins) is fixed and specified as part of the input. We are asked to extend this partial map to a map of all the vertices, again minimizing the weighted stretch of edges. This generalization, which we refer to as d-dimAP+, arises naturally in these application domains (since it can capture blocked-off parts of the board, or the requirement of power-carrying pins to be in certain locations, etc.). Perhaps surprisingly, very little is known about this problem from an approximation viewpoint.#R##N##R##N#For dimension d = 2, we obtain an O(k1/2 · log n)-approximation algorithm, based on a strengthening of the spreading-metric LP for 2-dimAP. The integrality gap for this LP is shown to be Ω(k1/4). We also show that it is NP-hard to approximate 2-dimAP+ within a factor better than Ω(k1/4-e). We also consider a (conceptually harder, but practically even more interesting) variant of 2-dimAP+, where the target space is the grid Z√n x Z√n, instead of the entire integer lattice Z2. For this problem, we obtain a O(k log k log n)-approximation using the same LP relaxation.

1843768,15514,23634,On the Communication Complexity of Sparse Set Disjointness and Exists-Equal Problems,2013,"In this paper we study the two player randomized communication complexity of the sparse set disjointness and the exists-equal problems and give matching lower and upper bounds (up to constant factors) for any number of rounds for both of these problems. In the sparse set disjointness problem, each player receives a k-subset of [m] and the goal is to determine whether the sets intersect. For this problem, we give a protocol that communicates a total of O(k log (r)  k) bits over r rounds and errs with very small probability. Here we can take r = log* k to obtain a O(k) total communication log* k-round protocol with exponentially small error probability, improving on the O(k)-bits O(log k)-round constant error probability protocol of Hastad and Wigderson from 1997. In the exists-equal problem, the players receive vectors x, y ∈ [t] n  and the goal is to determine whether there exists a coordinate i such that x i  = y i . Namely, the exists-equal problem is the OR of n equality problems. Observe that exists-equal is an instance of sparse set disjointness with k = n, hence the protocol above applies here as well, giving an O(n log (r)  n) upper bound. Our main technical contribution in this paper is a matching lower bound: we show that when t = Ω(n), any r-round randomized protocol for the exists-equal problem with error probability at most 1/3 should have a message of size Ω(n log (r)  n). Our lower bound holds even for super-constant r ≤ log* n, showing that any O(n) bits exists-equal protocol should have log* n - O(1) rounds. Note that the protocol we give errs only with less than polynomially small probability and provides guarantees on the total communication for the harder set disjointness problem, whereas our lower bound holds even for constant error probability protocols and for the easier exists-equal problem with guarantees on the max-communication. Hence our upper and lower bounds match in a strong sense. Our lower bound on the constant round protocols for exist-sequal shows that solving the OR of n instances of the equality problems requires strictly more than n times the cost of a single instance. To our knowledge this is the first example of such a super-linear increase in complexity."
1727849,15514,23634,Geometric Complexity Theory V: Equivalence between Blackbox Derandomization of Polynomial Identity Testing and Derandomization of Noether's Normalization Lemma,2012,"It is shown that black-box derandomization of polynomial identity testing (PIT) is essentially equivalent to derandomization of Noether's Normalization Lemma for explicit algebraic varieties, the problem that lies at the heart of the foundational classification problem of algebraic geometry. Specifically: (1) It is shown that in characteristic zero black-box derandomization of PIT for diagonal depth three circuits brings the problem of derandomizing Noether's Normalization Lemma, for the ring of invariants of any explicit linear action of a classical algebraic group of constant dimension, from EXPSPACE (where it is currently) to P. Next it is shown that assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), instead of the black-box derandomization hypothesis, brings the problem from EXPSPACE to quasi-PH, instead of P. Thus black-box derandomization of diagonal depth three circuits takes us farther than GRH here on the basis of the current knowledge. Variants of the main implication are also shown assuming, instead of the black-box derandomization hypothesis in characteristic zero, Boolean lower bounds for constant-depth threshold circuits or uniform Boolean conjectures, in conjunction with GRH. These results may explain in a unified way why proving lower bounds or derandomization results for constant-depth arithmetic circuits in characteristic zero or constant-depth Boolean threshold circuits, or proving uniform Boolean conjectures without relativizable proofs has turned out to be so hard, and also why GRH has turned out to be so hard from the complexity-theoretic perspective. Thus this investigation reveals that the foundational problems of Geometry (classification and GRH) and Complexity Theory (lower bounds and derandomization) share a common root difficulty that lies at the junction of these two fields. We refer to it as the GCT chasm. (2) It is shown that black-box derandomization of PIT in a strengthened form implies derandomization of Noether's Normalization Lemma in a strict form for any explicit algebraic variety. (3) Conversely, it is shown that derandomization of Noether's Normalization Lemma in a strict form for specific explicit varieties implies this strengthened form of black box derandomization of PIT and its various variants. (4) A unified geometric complexity theory (GCT) approach to derandomization and classification is formulated on the basis of this equivalence."
290568,15514,23684,On sketching matrix norms and the top singular vector,2014,"Sketching is a prominent algorithmic tool for processing large data. In this paper, we study the problem of sketching matrix norms. We consider two sketching models. The first is bilinear sketching, in which there is a distribution over pairs ofrxn matrices S and n x s matrices T such that for any fixed n x n matrix A, from S · A · T one can approximate ||A||p up to an approximation factor α ≥ 1 with constant probability, where ||A||p is a matrix norm. The second is general linear sketching, in which there is a distribution over linear maps L: Rn2 → Rk, such that for any fixed n x n matrix A, interpreting it as a vector in Rn2, from L(A) one can approximate ||A||p up to a factor α.#R##N##R##N#We study some of the most frequently occurring matrix norms, which correspond to Schatten p-norms for p e {0, 1, 2, ∞}. The p-th Schatten norm of a rank-r matrix A is defined to be [EQUATION], where σ1,...,σr are the singular values of A. When p = 0, ||A||0 is defined to be the rank of A. The cases p = 1, 2, and ∞ correspond to the trace, Frobenius, and operator norms, respectively. For bilinear sketches we show:#R##N##R##N#1. For p = ∞ any sketch must have r · s = O(n2/α4) dimensions. This matches an upper bound of Andoni and Nguyen (SODA, 2013), and implies one cannot approximate the top right singular vector v of A by a vector v' with ||v' -- v||2 ≤ 1/2 with r · s = o(n2)#R##N##R##N#2. For p e {0, 1} and constant α, any sketch must have r · s ≥ n1-e dimensions, for arbitrarily small constant e > 0.#R##N##R##N#3. For even integers p ≥ 2, we give a sketch with r · s = O(n2-4/pe-2) dimensions for obtaining a (1 + e)-approximation. This is optimal up to logarithmic factors, and is the first general subquadratic upper bound for sketching the Schatten norms.#R##N##R##N#For general linear sketches our results, though not optimal, are qualitatively similar, showing that for p = ∞, k = Ω(n3/2/α4) and for p e {0, 1}, k = Ω(√n). These give separations in the sketching complexity of Schatten-p norms with the corresponding vector p-norms, and rule out a table lookup nearest-neighbor search for p = 1, making progress on a question of Andoni."
2086093,15514,20561,Network-Centric Control for Multirobot Teams in Urban Search and Rescue,2011,"Theories from Network-centric Warfare (NCW) distinguish between network-centric and platform--centric orientations to sensing and control. In platform-centric control the operator(s) access and focus on data through platforms they control, a robot's camera, for example. In network-centric control the operator(s) do not access data through platforms but instead through the network without regard to where information originated. The conventional human role in sophisticated information gathering systems is usually as both commander (of platforms) and perceiver. Human sensory and perceptual capabilities, however, far outstrip our abilities to process information frequently making our perceptual function more critical to the mission. The use of human operators as perceptual sensors is standard practice for both UAVs and ground robotics where humans are called upon to process camera video to find targets and assist in navigation. This paper traces the evolution of an experimental human-multirobot system for Urban Search and Rescue from a platform--centric implementation in which operators navigated robots while searching for victims in streaming video to a network--centric version in which they search recorded video asynchronously. We describe two lines of research leading to our current design. In the first we identify the navigation task as both more difficult and the limiting factor in extending control to larger robot teams. In the second we found a few strategically selected images viewed asynchronously roughly comparable in performance to continuously viewed streaming video."
1154129,15514,23735,Seamless aiding of inertial-slam using Visual Directional Constraints from a monocular vision,2012,"Inertial-SLAM has been actively studied as it can provide all-terrain navigational capability with full six degrees-of-freedom information to autonomous robots. With the recent availability of low-cost inertial and vision sensors, a light-weight and accurate mapping system could be achieved for many robotic tasks such as land/aerial explorations. The key challenge toward this is in the availability of reliable and constant aiding information to correct the inertial system which is intrinsically unstable. The existing approaches have been relying on feature-based maps, which require accurate depth-resolution process to correct the inertial units properly where the aiding rate is highly dependent on the map density. In this work we propose to directly integrate the visual odometry to the inertial system by fusing the scale ambiguous translation vectors as Visual Directional Constraints (VDC) on vehicle motion at high update rates, while the 3D map being still used to constrain the longitudinal drifts but in a relaxed way. In this way, the visual odometry information can be seamlessly fused to inertial system by resolving the scale ambiguity problem between inertial and monocular camera thus achieving a reliable and constant aiding. The proposed approach is evaluated on SLAM benchmark dataset and simulated environment, showing a more stable and consistent performance of monocular inertial-SLAM."
922374,15514,23735,Stable haptic feedback based on a dynamic vision sensor for microrobotics,2012,"This work presents a stable vision based haptic feedback for micromanipulation using both an asynchronous Address Event Representation (AER) silicon retina and a conventional frame-based camera. At this scale, most of the grippers used to manipulate objects lack of force sensing. High frequency vision detection thus provides a sound solution to get information about the position of the object and the tool to provide virtual haptic guides. Artificial retinas present high update rates, which enables to address one of the major challenge of haptic feedback teleoperation systems, namely stability. However static objects are not detected. The haptic feedback is thus based on an asynchronous silicon retina to provide a high update rate of moving objects and a frame-based camera to retrieve the position of the target object. This approach is validated by pick-and-place of microspheres (diameter: around 50 micrometers) using a piezoelectric microgripper. The displacement of the tool, as well as the opening and closing of the gripper are controlled by the haptic device. Haptic virtual guides are transmitted to users to assist them in the different steps of the pick-and-place task: a virtual stiffness ensures the correct alignment of the tool with respect to the object, a repulsive haptic force enables users to monitor the gripping step, and operators are assisted while picking and placing the object."
413757,15514,23845,Hierarchical Motion Planning in Topological Representations,2012,"Motion can be described in alternative represen- tations, including joint configuration or end-effector spaces, but also more complex topological representations that imply a change of Voronoi bias, metric or topology of the motion space. Certain types of robot interaction problems, e.g. wrapping around an object, can suitably be described by so-called writhe and interaction mesh representations. However, considering mo- tion synthesis solely in topological spaces is insufficient since it does not cater for additional tasks and constraints in other representations. In this paper we propose methods to combine and exploit different representations for motion synthesis, with specific emphasis on generalization of motion to novel situations. Our approach is formulated in the framework of optimal con- trol as an approximate inference problem, which allows for a direct extension of the graphical model to incorporate multiple representations. Motion generalization is similarly performed by projecting motion from topological to joint configuration space. We demonstrate the benefits of our methods on problems where direct path finding in joint configuration space is extremely hard whereas local optimal control exploiting a representation with different topology can efficiently find optimal trajectories. Further, we illustrate the successful online motion generalization to dynamic environments on challenging, real world problems."
1288696,15514,23735,A linear relaxation solution of the Tactical Movement Problem,2012,"The Tactical Movement Problem seeks to determine the minimum cost mission for a robotic agent tasked to complete an assignment that involves both moving through its environment and manipulating that environment. The problem arises in several contexts including open-pit mining automation when a robotic excavator is tasked to remove a designated area of material. The work involves the excavator progressively digging earth, which is usually loaded to trucks. After each load cycle, a decision about from where to take the next dig must be made. Periodically this involves moving the excavator to a new location. The objective is to complete the task in minimum time or at a minimum energy cost or some similarly motivated cost function. The problem becomes one of determining the optimal path that the excavator should take and the dig operations that should be completed at each point along the path. In this paper the problem is posed as a linear relaxation that is solved successively to near optimality. Simulated results show that cost effective paths can be generated however there is still significant computation burden due to the high complexity of the problem. This result allows the solution of much larger task planning problems than were previously possible, thus moving towards the goal of cost effective automated excavation."
730125,15514,23684,Survivable network design problems in wireless networks,2011,"Survivable network design is an important suite of algorithmic problems where the goal is to select a minimum cost network subject to the constraint that some desired connectivity property has to be satisfied by the network. Traditionally, these problems have been studied in a model where individual edges (and sometimes nodes) have an associated cost. This model does not faithfully represent wireless networks, where the activation of an edge is dependent on the selection of parameter values at its endpoints, and the cost incurred is a function of these values. We present a realistic optimization model for the design of survivable wireless networks that generalizes various connectivity problems studied in the theory literature, e.g. node-weighted steiner network, power optimization, minimum connected dominating set, and in the networking literature, e.g. installation cost optimization, minimum broadcast tree. We obtain the following algorithmic results for our general model:   1. For  k  = 1 and 2, we give  O (log  n )-approximation algorithms for both the vertex and edge connectivity versions of the  k -connectivity problem. These results are tight (up to constants); we show that even for  k  = 1, it is NP-hard to obtain an approximation factor of  o (log  n ).   2. For the minimum steiner network problem, we give a tight (up to constants)  O (log  n )-approximation algorithm.   3. We give a reduction from the  k -edge connectivity problem to a more tractable degree-constrained problem. This involves proving new connectivity theorems that might be of independent interest. We apply this result to obtain new approximation algorithms in the power optimization and installation cost optimization applications."
1498837,15514,23735,Optimal high-dynamic-range image acquisition for humanoid robots,2013,"Humanoid robots should be able to visually recognize objects and estimate their 6D pose in real environmental conditions with their limited sensor capabilities. In order to achieve these visual skills, it is necessary to establish an optimal visual transducer connecting the scene layout with the internal representations of objects and places. This visual transducer should capture the noiseless visual manifold of the scene with high-dynamic-range in an efficient manner. Our endeavor is to develop such a visual transducer using the widespread LDR cameras in humanoid robots. In our previous work, the noiseless acquisition of continuous images [1] and the improved radio-metric calibration [2] already enabled the humanoid robots to attain the desired visual manifold in terms of quality. However, since the radiance range of the scene can be very wide, the required amount of exposures to capture the visual manifold (robustly without radiance inconsistencies) turns impractically large in terms of scope, granularity and acquisition time. In this article, a method for estimating the minimal amount of exposures and their particular integration times is presented. This method integrates our previous work in order to synthesize HDR images with the minimal amount of exposures while ensuring the high quality of the resulting image. Conclusively, the minimal exposure set provides performance improvements without quality trade-off. Experimental evaluation is presented with the humanoid robots ARMAR-III a, b [3]."
1859160,15514,23684,Finding endogenously formed communities,2013,"A central problem in data mining and social network analysis is determining overlapping communities (clusters) among individuals or objects in the absence of external identification or tagging. We address this problem by introducing a framework that captures the notion of communities or clusters determined by the relative affinities among their members. To this end we define what we call an affinity system, which is a set of elements, each with a vector characterizing its preference for all other elements in the set. We define a natural notion of (potentially overlapping) communities in an affinity system, in which the members of a given community collectively prefer each other to anyone else outside the community. Thus these communities are endogenously formed in the affinity system and are self-determined or self-certified by its members.#R##N##R##N#We provide a tight polynomial bound on the number of self-determined communities as a function of the robustness of the community. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for enumerating these communities. Moreover, we obtain a local algorithm with a strong stochastic performance guarantee that can find a community in time nearly linear in the of size the community (as opposed to the size of the network).#R##N##R##N#Social networks and social interactions fit particularly naturally within the affinity system framework -- if we can appropriately extract the affinities from the relatively sparse yet rich information from social networks and social interactions, our analysis then yields a set of efficient algorithms for enumerating self-determined communities in social networks. In the context of social networks we also connect our analysis with results about (α, β)-clusters introduced by Mishra, Schreiber, Stanton, and Tarjan [22, 23]. In contrast with the polynomial bound we prove on the number of communities in the affinity system model, we show that there exists a family of networks with superpolynomial number of (α, β)-clusters."
611996,15514,23684,"Pipage rounding, pessimistic estimators and matrix concentration",2014,"Pipage rounding is a dependent random sampling technique that has several interesting properties and diverse applications. One property that has been useful in applications is negative correlation of the resulting vector. There are some further properties that would be interesting to derive, but do not seem to follow from negative correlation. In particular, recent concentration results for sums of independent random matrices are not known to extend to a negatively dependent setting.#R##N##R##N#We introduce a simple but useful technique called concavity of pessimistic estimators. This technique allows us to show concentration of submodular functions and concentration of matrix sums under pipage rounding. The former result answers a question of Chekuri et al. (2009). To prove the latter result, we derive a new variant of Lieb's celebrated concavity theorem in matrix analysis.#R##N##R##N#We provide numerous applications of these results. One is to spectrally-thin trees, a spectral analog of the thin trees that played a crucial role in the recent breakthrough on the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. We show a polynomial time algorithm that, given a graph where every edge has effective conductance at least κ, returns an O(κ-1 · log n/log log n)-spectrally-thin tree. There are further applications to rounding of semidefinite programs and to a geometric question of extracting a nearly-orthonormal basis from an isotropic distribution."
1176352,15514,23634,Optimal Bounds on Approximation of Submodular and XOS Functions by Juntas,2013,"We investigate the approximability of several classes of real-valued functions by functions of a small number of variables (juntas). Our main results are tight bounds on the number of variables required to approximate a function f:{0, 1} n  → [0,1] within l 2 -error ϵ over the uniform distribution: If f is sub modular, then it is ϵ-close to a function of O(1/ϵ 2  log 1/ϵ) variables. This is an exponential improvement over previously known results FeldmanKV:13. We note that Ω(1/ϵ 2 ) variables are necessary even for linear functions. If f is fractionally sub additive (XOS) it is e-close to a function of 2 O(1/ϵ2)  variables. This result holds for all functions with low total l 1 -influence and is a real-valued analogue of Fried gut's theorem for boolean functions. We show that 2 Ω(1/ϵ)  variables are necessary even for XOS functions. As applications of these results, we provide learning algorithms over the uniform distribution. For XOS functions, we give a PAC learning algorithm that runs in time 2 1/poly(ϵ)  poly(n). For sub modular functions we give an algorithm in the more demanding PMAC learning model BalcanHarvey:[12] which requires a multiplicative (1 + γ) factor approximation with probability at least 1 - ϵ over the target distribution. Our uniform distribution algorithm runs in time 2 1/poly(γϵ)  poly(n). This is the first algorithm in the PMAC model that can achieve a constant approximation factor arbitrarily close to 1 for all sub modular functions (even over the uniform distribution). It relies crucially on our approximation by junta result. As follows from the lower bounds in FeldmanKV:13 both of these algorithms are close to optimal. We also give applications for proper learning, testing and agnostic learning with value queries of these classes."
1616932,15514,23735,Vehicle-terrain interaction models for analysis and performance evaluation of wheeled rovers,2012,"In this work, a multibody dynamics model of a wheeled mobile robot is developed to characterize the terrain reaction forces in terms of the physical and control parameters of the system. A common strategy for simulating the motion of mobile robots on soft soil is to compute the soil reaction forces using terramechanics models and to solve a forward dynamics problem by considering the soil reactions as a set of forces applied to the system. This intends to provide an accurate computation of the forces involved in the wheel-soil interaction; however, a series of factors such as the sensitivity of reaction forces to soil parameters limits the applicability of the existing terramechanics models in unstructured environments. We propose an alternative approach which does not rely on the soil properties, but at the same time does not intend to provide an exact computation of wheel-soil interaction forces. The main objective of this approach is to estimate the effect of changes in control and design parameters on the performance of the system, using the information provided by the dynamics model of the vehicle. To this end, the reaction forces for the wheel-terrain interaction in the ideal limit case of pure rolling and no penetration are obtained upon the specification of the motion at the contact points, via kinematic constraints. The validity of the analysis results obtained using the proposed paradigm is verified by simulation runs and experiments. The experimental results suggest that this approach is successful in predicting the variation of a set of important performance indicators in terms of the changes in the parameters of the system."
1198912,15514,23735,Design of a spine-inspired kinematic for the guidance of flexible instruments in minimally invasive surgery,2014,"One standard procedure in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is the endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), where neoplastic mucosal tissue is being removed. To execute an ESD the surgeon needs to be well-trained and experienced to operate the flexible instruments precisely under visual monitoring. One of the main drawbacks is the unintuitive control of standard systems and the limited possibility for triangulation. Big motions on the endoscope's handle are transmitted into small movements of the endoscope's distal end inside the stomach and changing the field of view also changes the instrument's orientation and vice versa. We chose the ESD as a starting point to advance to Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) later on. To improve the ESD, we develop a telemanipulation system, mainly fabricated by selective laser sintering (SLS) of a biocompatible polymer. In this paper we present our spine-inspired kinematic driven via push rods and bowden cables that provides sufficient triangulation with a promising trade-off between flexibility to insert the systems into the patient and adequate stiffness to reliably manipulate the mucosal tissue. To connect the actuators, we use a magnetic coupling to separate sterile and non-sterile parts."
1472744,15514,65,Head-mounted binocular gaze tracker as a human-robot interfacing device,2013,"This paper suggests a head-mounted binocular gaze tracker working as an interfacing device for human-robot interaction. The purpose of the binocular gazes tracker is to extract the user-selective visual attention areas in three dimensional space and to let the robot know the current interests of human operators. In expanded 3D space, its calibration method utilizes two calibration planes in order to calculate a pair of the matched mapping points between the front camera and two eye-monitoring cameras. Therefore, the user-attentional object point can be tracked regardless of variations in the object distance from the user to the target object by using the binocular gaze tracker. Based on this basic functionality, it can be used in the real world as an interactive human-robot interfacing device. In the learning process of human-robot interaction, the human operator of wearing the head-mounted gaze tracker teaches the robot with its own vision system what the names of target objects are and what their visual images are. After the robot learning, each of the memorized target objects is recalled by the operator, and the robot compares the recalled image with a series of front-view images in real applications. With the continuous recognition of the target object, the robot moves to the target and is ready to handle it within a certain distance. A series of experiments is performed to evaluate its usefulness and effectiveness in variations of the 3D position of an attentive object. The experimental results are discussed in detail."
757301,15514,65,"Expressive motion with x, y and theta: Laban Effort Features for mobile robots",2014,"There is a saying that 95% of communication is body language, but few robot systems today make effective use of that ubiquitous channel. Motion is an essential area of social communication that will enable robots and people to collaborate naturally, develop rapport, and seamlessly share environments. The proposed work presents a principled set of motion features based on the Laban Effort system, a widespread and extensively tested acting ontology for the dynamics of “how” we enact motion. The features allow us to analyze and, in future work, generate expressive motion using position (x, y) and orientation (theta). We formulate representative features for each Effort and parameterize them on expressive motion sample trajectories collected from experts in robotics and theater. We then produce classifiers for different “manners” of moving and assess the quality of results by comparing them to the humans labeling the same set of paths on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Results indicate that the machine analysis (41.7% match between intended and classified manner) achieves similar accuracy overall compared to a human benchmark (41.2% match). We conclude that these motion features perform well for analyzing expression in low degree of freedom systems and could be used to help design more effectively expressive mobile robots."
2382000,15514,23735,MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control,2012,"We describe a new physics engine tailored to model-based control. Multi-joint dynamics are represented in generalized coordinates and computed via recursive algorithms. Contact responses are computed via efficient new algorithms we have developed, based on the modern velocity-stepping approach which avoids the difficulties with spring-dampers. Models are specified using either a high-level C++ API or an intuitive XML file format. A built-in compiler transforms the user model into an optimized data structure used for runtime computation. The engine can compute both forward and inverse dynamics. The latter are well-defined even in the presence of contacts and equality constraints. The model can include tendon wrapping as well as actuator activation states (e.g. pneumatic cylinders or muscles). To facilitate optimal control applications and in particular sampling and finite differencing, the dynamics can be evaluated for different states and controls in parallel. Around 400,000 dynamics evaluations per second are possible on a 12-core machine, for a 3D homanoid with 18 dofs and 6 active contacts. We have already used the engine in a number of control applications. It will soon be made publicly available."
833754,15514,23735,An online algorithm for simultaneously learning forward and inverse kinematics,2012,"This paper proposes a supervised algorithm for online learning of input-output relations that is particularly suitable to simultaneously learn the forward and inverse kinematics of general manipulators — the multi-valued nature of the inverse kinematics of serial chains and forward kinematics of parallel manipulators makes it infeasible to apply state-of-the-art learning techniques to these problems, as they typically assume a single-valued function to be learned. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalized expectation maximization approach to fit an infinite mixture of linear experts to an online stream of data samples, together with an outlier probabilistic model that dynamically grows the number of linear experts allocated to the mixture, this way controlling the complexity of the resulting model. The result is an incremental, online and localized learning algorithm that performs nonlinear, multivariate regression on multivariate outputs by approximating the target function by a linear relation within each expert input domain, which can directly provide forward and inverse multi-valued estimates. The experiments presented in this paper show that it can achieve, for single-valued functions, a performance directly comparable to state-of-the-art online function approximation algorithms, while additionally providing inverse predictions and the capability to learn multi-valued functions in a natural manner. To our knowledge this is a distinctive property of the algorithm presented in this paper."
2100891,15514,20774,Hierarchical graph partitioning,2014,"One of the important optimization questions in highly parallel systems is the problem of assigning computational resources to communicating tasks. While scheduling tasks/operators, tasks assigned to nearby resources (e.g. on the same CPU core) have low communication costs, whereas tasks assigned to distant resources (e.g. on different server racks) have high communication costs. An optimal solution of task to resource assignment minimizes the communication cost of the task ensemble while satisfying the load balancing requirements. We model such an optimization question of minimizing communication cost as a new class of graph partitioning problems called  hierarchical graph partitioning.    In hierarchical graph partitioning we are given a graph  G=(V,E) , vertices representing the tasks and edges representing the communication among the vertices. We are also given vertex demands  d: V(G) → R +   denoting the processing load of each task and edge weights  w: E(G) → R +   denoting the amount of communication and our goal is to decompose  G  into  k  parts/servers of nearly equal weight (for load balancing) and minimize the total cost of the edges being cut (communication cost). However, unlike traditional  k -balanced graph partitioning where the cost of an edge cut is independent of the parts containing the two respective end vertices, here the cost varies with the distance of the servers corresponding to the two parts. Since, the servers are generally arranged in a hierarchy, distance is given by a tree metric. In this paper, we initiate the study of hierarchical graph partitioning problem and give efficient algorithms with approximation guarantee. Hierarchical graph partitioning is a significant generalization of graph partitioning problem and faithfully captures several practical scenarios that have served as major motivating applications for graph partitioning."

In this paper, we study three different methods to command a one-arm mobile manipulator from a 6-DOF input device capable of haptic feedback. The linkage between the master and the slave devices is asymmetric, that is, the input haptic interface (master) is much smaller and has different kinematics and dynamics from the robot arm and the mobile base (slave). Three different master-slave motion coordination schemes are compared here (1) workspace clutching, (2) differential end-zone, and (3) position/rate switching. We study repetitive user performance for seven subjects in a static Tower of Hanoi manipulation task and present single case studies for two mobile manipulation tasks: door opening and large-displacement Towers of Hanoi. Our experimental platform consists of a 4-DOF WAM (Whole Arm Manipulator) on a Segway RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform) controlled by a Phantom Omni haptic device. Cameras are used to relay scene images to the remote operator. The human stays in the loop throughout the entire task. The results obtained from user studies provide insight on how to interface and command a mobile manipulator."
2402185,15514,8960,Clustering Aggregation as Maximum-Weight Independent Set,2012,"We formulate clustering aggregation as a special instance of Maximum-Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem. For a given dataset, an attributed graph is constructed from the union of the input clusterings generated by different underlying clustering algorithms with different parameters. The vertices, which represent the distinct clusters, are weighted by an internal index measuring both cohesion and separation. The edges connect the vertices whose corresponding clusters overlap. Intuitively, an optimal aggregated clustering can be obtained by selecting an optimal subset of non-overlapping clusters partitioning the dataset together. We formalize this intuition as the MWIS problem on the attributed graph, i.e., finding the heaviest subset of mutually non-adjacent vertices.#R##N##R##N#This MWIS problem exhibits a special structure. Since the clusters of each input clustering form a partition of the dataset, the vertices corresponding to each clustering form a maximal independent set (MIS) in the attributed graph. We propose a variant of simulated annealing method that takes advantage of this special structure. Our algorithm starts from each MIS, which is close to a distinct local optimum of the MWIS problem, and utilizes a local search heuristic to explore its neighborhood in order to find the MWIS. Extensive experiments on many challenging datasets show that: 1. our approach to clustering aggregation automatically decides the optimal number of clusters; 2. it does not require any parameter tuning for the underlying clustering algorithms; 3. it can combine the advantages of different underlying clustering algorithms to achieve superior performance; 4. it is robust against moderate or even bad input clusterings."
2113330,15514,23735,Optimality principles in variable stiffness control: The VSA hammer,2011,"The control of a robot's mechanical impedance is attracting increasing attention of the robotics community. Recent research in Robotics has recognized the importance of Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA) in safety and performance of robots. An important step in using VSA for safety has been to understand the optimality principles that regulate the synchronized variation of stiffness and velocity when moving in the shortest time while limiting possible impact forces (the safe brachistochrone problem). In this paper, we follow a similar program of understanding the use of VSA in performance enhancement, looking at very dynamic tasks where impacts are maximized. To this purpose we address a new optimization problem that consists in choosing the inputs for maximizing the velocity of a link at a given final position, such as, e.g., for maximizing the effect of a hammer impact. We first study the problem with fixed stiffness, and show that, under realistic modeling assumptions, there does exist an optimal linear spring for the given inertia and motor. We then study optimal control of VSA and show that varying the spring stiffness during the execution of the hammering task improves the final performance substantially. The optimal control law is obtained analytically, thus providing insight in the optimality principles underpinning general VSA control. Finally, we show the practicality of our theoretical results with experimental tests."
1792930,15514,23735,Slacking prevention during assistive contour following tasks with guaranteed coupled stability,2012,"Passive velocity field control is advantageous to deliver human-in-the-loop contour tracking rehabilitation exercises, since patients can be allowed to proceed with their preferred pace, while assistance can still be provided as determined by the therapist with ensured coupled stability. We introduce a framework based on passive velocity field control for robot assisted rehabilitation that includes prevention mechanisms against undesired slacking behavior of patients. This framework not only provides systematic approaches to prevent slacking, but also can do so while ensuring coupled stability of the overall robot patient system, a property that cannot be assured with any of the other ad-hoc slacking prevention methods. In particular, the proposed approach enables seamless on-line modification of the task difficulty, speed of contour following, and the level of assistance, while preserving passivity of the system with respect to external forces. The proposed slacking prevention schemes encourage active participation of the patients in rehabilitation protocols with even increased number of repetitions and thanks to flexibility introduced by the controller, render delivery of “repetitive tasks without repeating the same task” possible. Experiments with an haptic interface are included to demonstrate the passivity of the proposed control framework and preliminary human subject experiments with healthy volunteers are presented to validate feasibility and usability of the proposed approaches."
1656948,15514,8806,An integrated architecture for autonomous vehicles simulation,2012,"Modeling and simulation tools are being increasingly acclaimed in the research field of autonomous vehicles systems, as they provide suitable test beds for the development and evaluation of such complex systems. However, these tools still do not account for some integration capabilities amongst several state-of-the-art Intelligent Transportation Systems, e.g. to study autonomous driving behaviors in human-steered urban traffic scenarios, which are crucial to the Future Urban Transport paradigm.   In this paper we describe the modeling and implementation of an integration architecture of two types of simulators, namely a robotics and a traffic simulator. This integration should enable autonomous vehicles to be deployed in a rather realistic traffic flow as an agent entity (on the traffic simulator), at the same time it simulates all its sensors and actuators (on the robotics counterpart). Also, the statistical tools available in the traffic simulator will allow practitioners to infer what kind of advantages such a novel technology will bring to our everyday's lives. Furthermore, an architecture for the integration of the aforementioned simulators is proposed and implemented in the light of the most desired features of such software environments.   To assess the usefulness of the platform architecture towards the expected realistic simulation facility, a comprehensive system evaluation is performed and critically reviewed, leveraging the feasibility of the integration. Further developments and future perspectives are also suggested."

In our model, search providers compete for customers by strategically selecting which search results to display in response to user queries. Customers, in turn, have private preferences over search results and will tend to use search engines that are more likely to display pages satisfying their demands. Our main question is whether competition between search engines increases the overall welfare of the users (i.e., the likelihood that a user finds a page of interest). When search engines derive utility only from customers to whom they show relevant results, we show that they differentiate their results, and every equilibrium of the resulting game achieves at least half of the welfare that could be obtained by a social planner. This bound also applies whenever the likelihood of selecting a given engine is a convex function of the probability that a user's demand will be satisfied, which includes natural Markovian models of user behavior.   On the other hand, when search engines derive utility from all customers (independent of search result relevance) and the customer demand functions are not convex, there are instances in which the (unique) equilibrium involves no differentiation between engines and a high degree of randomness in search results. This can degrade social welfare by a factor of Ω(√{NUMPAGES}) relative to the social optimum, where NUMPAGES is the number of webpages. These bad equilibria persist even when search engines can extract only small (but non-zero) expected revenue from dissatisfied users, and much higher revenue from satisfied ones."
1273899,15514,104,Categorical range maxima queries,2014,"Given an array A[1...n] of n distinct elements from the set {1, 2, ..., n} a range maximum query RMQ(a, b) returns the highest element in A[a...b] along with its position. In this paper, we study a generalization of this classical problem called  Categorical Range Maxima Query  (CRMQ) problem, in which each element A[i] in the array has an associated category (color) given by C[i] ∈ [σ]. A query then asks to report each distinct color c appearing in C[a...b] along with the highest element (and its position) in A[a...b] with color c. Let p c  denote the  position  of the highest element in A[a...b] with color c. We investigate two variants of this problem: a threshold version and a top-k version. In threshold version, we only need to output the colors with A[p c ] more than the input threshold τ, whereas top-k variant asks for k colors with the highest A[p c ] values. In the word RAM model, we achieve linear space structure along with O(k) query time, that can report colors in sorted order of A[•]. In external memory, we present a data structure that answers queries in optimal O(1+k/B) I/O's using almost-linear O(n log* n) space, as well as a linear space data structure with O(log* n + k/B) query I/Os. Here k represents the output size, log* n is the iterated logarithm of n and B is the block size. CRMQ has applications to document retrieval and categorical range reporting -- giving a one-shot framework to obtain improved results in both these problems. Our results for CRMQ not only improve the existing best known results for three-sided categorical range reporting but also overcome the hurdle of maintaining color uniqueness in the output set."
1914890,15514,23735,Managing execution variants in task coordination by exploiting design-time models at run-time,2011,"The development of service robots has gained more and more attention over the last years. Advanced robots have to cope with many different situations and contingencies while executing concurrent and interruptable complex tasks. In particular, mobile manipulation tasks increase the complexity. To manage the raising number of tasks and execution variants in complex environments there is a tremendous need for context and situation dependent composition and selection of reusable skills. This requires explicit descriptions of relevant properties and parameters of the robot, its resources and its capabilities. Different views on partial aspects of a robot system (mechanical, electrical and even software) can be provided by different models as is already common practice at design-time. However, these design-time models also need to be accessible at run-time to support run-time reasoning of the robot in order to adequately compose its skills and assign resources. That requires to extract useful information out of the design-time models and to transform it into representations which can be exploited at runtime. We present an approach to exploit information provided via design-time models (e.g. software components, simulation, planning) for run-time decision making. It allows for more informed decisions on how to compose action plots at run-time in order to manage the huge amount of different execution variants in service robotics."
1031811,15514,23684,On LP-based approximability for strict CSPs,2011,"In a beautiful result, Raghavendra established optimal Unique Games Conjecture (UGC)-based inapproximability for a large class of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). In the class of CSPs he considers, of which Maximum Cut is a prominent example, the goal is to find an assignment which maximizes a weighted fraction of constraints satisfied. He gave a generic semi-definite program (SDP) for this class of problems and showed how the approximability of each problem is determined by the corresponding SDP (upto an arbitrarily small additive error) assuming the UGC. He noted that his techniques do no apply to CSPs with  strict  constraints (all of which  must  be satisfied) such as Vertex Cover.   In this paper we address the approximability of these strict-CSPs. In the class of CSPs we consider, one is given a set of constraints over a set of variables, and a cost function over the assignments, the goal is to find an assignment to the variables of minimum cost which satisfies  all  the constraints. We present a generic linear program (LP) for a large class of strict-CSPs and give a systematic way to convert integrality gaps for this LP into UGC-based inapproximability results. Some important problems whose approximability our framework captures are Vertex Cover, Hypergraph Vertex Cover,  k -partite-Hypergraph Vertex Cover, Independent Set and other covering and packing problems over  q -ary alphabets, and a scheduling problem. For the covering and packing problems, which occur quite commonly in practice as well, we provide a matching rounding algorithm, thus settling their approximability upto an arbitrarily small additive error."
988596,15514,23735,On improving the extrapolation capability of task-parameterized movement models,2013,"Gestures are characterized by intermediary or final landmarks (real or virtual) in task space or joint space that can change during the course of the motion, and that are described by varying accuracy and correlation constraints. Generalizing these trajectories in robot learning by imitation is challenging, because of the small number of demonstrations provided by the user. We present an approach to statistically encode movements in a task-parameterized mixture model, and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to train it. The model automatically extracts the relevance of candidate coordinate systems during the task, and exploits this information during reproduction to adapt the movement in real-time to changing position and orientation of landmarks or objects. The approach is tested with a robotic arm learning to roll out a pizza dough. It is compared to three categories of task-parameterized models: 1) Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a trajectory models database; 2) Multi-streams approach with models trained in several frames of reference; and 3) Parametric Gaussian mixture model (PGMM) modulating the Gaussian centers with the task parameters. We show that the extrapolation capability of the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, by extracting the local structures of the task instead of relying on interpolation principles."
1938152,15514,23684,An almost optimal unrestricted fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform,2011,"The problems of random projections and sparse reconstruction have much in common and individually received much attention. Surprisingly, until now they progressed in parallel and remained mostly separate. Here, we employ new tools from probability in Banach spaces that were successfully used in the context of sparse reconstruction to advance on an open problem in random pojection. In particular, we generalize and use an intricate result by Rudelson and Veshynin [2008] for sparse reconstruction which uses Dudley’s theorem for bounding Gaussian processes. Our main result states that any set of  N  = exp( O ( n )) real vectors in  n  dimensional space can be linearly mapped to a space of dimension  k  =  O (log  N  polylog( n )), while (1) preserving the pairwise distances among the vectors to within any constant distortion and (2) being able to apply the transformation in time  O ( n  log  n ) on each vector. This improves on the best known bound  N  = exp( O ( n  1/2 )) achieved by Ailon and Liberty [2009] and  N  = exp( O ( n  1/3 )) by Ailon and Chazelle [2010]. The dependence in the distortion constant however is suboptimal, and since the publication of an early version of the work, the gap between upper and lower bounds has been considerably tightened obtained by Krahmer and Ward [2011]. For constant distortion, this settles the open question posed by these authors up to a polylog( n ) factor while considerably simplifying their constructions."
1310448,15514,23735,Teleimpedance control of a synergy-driven anthropomorphic hand,2013,"In this paper, a novel synergy driven teleimpedance controller for the Pisa-IIT SoftHand is presented. Towards the development of an efficient, robust, and low-cost hand prothesis, the Pisa-IIT SoftHand is built on the motor control principle of synergies, through which the immense complexity of the hand is simplified into distinct motor patterns. As the SoftHand grasps, it follows a synergistic path with built-in flexibility to allow grasping of objects of various shapes using only a single motor. In this work, the hand grasping motion is regulated with an impedance controller which incorporates the user's postural and stiffness synergy profiles in realtime. In addition, a disturbance observer is realized which estimates the grasping contact force. The estimated force is then fedback to the user via a vibration motor. Grasp robustness and transparency improvements were evaluated on two healthy subjects while grasping different objects. Implementation of the proposed teleimpedance controller led to the execution of stable grasps by controlling the grasping forces, via modulation of hand compliance. In addition, utilization of the vibrotactile feedback resulted in reduced physical load on the user. While these results need to be validated with amputees, they provide evidence that a low-cost, robust hand employing hardware-based synergies is a viable alternative to traditional myoelectric prostheses."
