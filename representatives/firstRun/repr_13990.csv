984799,13990,8839,"From grad school, to startup to acquisition",2014,"In 2006, John Bicket and Sanjit Biswas took a leave from their graduate research at MIT to start a networking company called Meraki, which eventually grew to a fast-growing, profitable company acquired by Cisco in 2012 for $1.2 billion.   In this talk, Sanjit will recount the history of Meraki, from the Roofnet project at MIT CSAIL, to bootstrapping the business from the sales of their first product, to scaling up to over 500 employees. He will also share some of the lessons learned along the way, and will discuss some similarities between building computer systems as Ph.D. students and building a company."
2066865,13990,22021,Sneak-path constraints in memristor crossbar arrays,2013,"In a memristor crossbar array, a memristor is positioned on each row-column intersection, and its resistance, low or high, represents two logical states. The state of every memristor can be sensed by the current flowing through the memristor. In this work, we study the sneak path problem in crossbars arrays, in which current can sneak through other cells, resulting in reading a wrong state of the memristor. Our main contributions are a new characterization of arrays free of sneak paths, and efficient methods to read the array cells while avoiding sneak paths. To each read method we match a constraint on the array content that guarantees sneak-path free readout, and calculate the resulting capacity."
2228102,13990,20561,Developing a Critical Infrastructure and Control Systems Cybersecurity Curriculum,2013,"This paper discusses the initial course development, portable living laboratory environment, student achievements and course revisions for an undergraduate and graduate level critical infrastructure and control systems cybersecurity curriculum. The curriculum developed is based upon DePaul University's Computer and Network Security (CNS) 366 / 466 delivered during the Spring 2011, Fall 2011 and Spring 2012 quarters and collaborative industry partnerships. The educational methods employed in the curriculum provide the students with hands-on, cognitive experiences associated with production control system equipment. The critical infrastructure testbed projects coupled with the rapid prototyping environment provide faculty and students with real world associations leading to increased risk analysis accuracy and knowledge conveyance. The curriculum may be used at other institutions to cross-educate computer science and security disciplines with traditional engineering programs and become associated within the current partnership of industry and academic institutions leveraging the curriculum."
1972033,13990,11321,Information-theoretic connectivity-based cortex parcellation,2011,"One of the most promising avenues for compiling connectivity data originates from the notion that individual brain regions maintain individual connectivity profiles; the functional repertoire of a cortical area (the functional fingerprint) is closely related to its anatomical connections (the connectional fingerprint) and, hence, a segregated cortical area may be characterized by a highly coherent connectivity pattern. Existing clustering techniques in the context of connectivity-based cortex parcellation are usually exploratory. We therefore advocate an information-theoretic framework for connectivity-based cortex parcellation which avoids many assumptions imposed by previous methods. Clustering is based upon maximizing connectivity information while allowing noise in the data to vote for the optimal number of cortical subunits. The automatic parcellation of the inferior frontal gyrus together with the precentral gyrus reveals cortical subunits consistent with previous studies."
1999607,13990,22021,Global estimation of anatomical connection strength in diffusion MRI tractography by message-passing,2011,"This paper addresses an important problem in diffusion weighted MRI tractography -the estimation of the anatomical strength of reconstructed neuronal fibers. Our method incorporates information on the amount of white matter in voxels (small areas of brain) with diffusion data and estimates structural strength of fibers globally, by considering all the fibers and all the voxels simultaneously. We achieve this by using a message-passing optimization procedure, specially tailored for this problem, that operates on a bipartite graph with nodes corresponding to fibers and voxels. New estimates of fiber strength allow derivation of new measures for quantifying anatomical connections between large gray matter regions. In this paper we propose two: Anatomical Connection Weight (ACW) and Normalized Connection Weight (NCW). The proposed methodology was applied on human data and tested for convergence and consistency."
2455515,13990,20348,Cyclic network automata and cohomological waves,2014,"Following Baryshnikov-Coffman-Kwak, we use cyclic network automata (CNA) to generate a decentralized protocol for dynamic coverage problems in a sensor network, with only a small fraction of sensors awake at every moment. This paper gives a rigorous analysis of CNA and shows that waves of awake-state nodes automatically solve pusuit/evasion-type problems without centralized coordination. As a corollary of this work, we unearth some interesting topological interpretations of features previously observed in cyclic cellular automata (CCA). By considering CCA over networks and completing to simplicial complexes, we induce dynamics on the higher-dimensional complex. In this setting, waves are seen to be generated by topological defects with a nontrivial degree (or winding number). The simplicial complex has the topological type of the underlying map of the workspace (a subset of the plane), and the resulting waves can be classified cohomologically. This allows one to 'program' pulses in the sensor network according to cohomology class. We give a realization theorem for such pulse waves."
813498,13990,22021,"Brute force searching, the typical set and Guesswork",2013,"Consider the situation where a word is chosen probabilistically from a finite list. If an attacker knows the list and can inquire about each word in turn, then selecting the word via the uniform distribution maximizes the attacker's difficulty, its Guesswork, in identifying the chosen word. It is tempting to use this property in cryptanalysis of computationally secure ciphers by assuming coded words are drawn from a source's typical set and so, for all intents and purposes, uniformly distributed within it. By applying recent results on Guesswork, for i.i.d. sources it is this equipartition ansatz that we investigate here. In particular, we demonstrate that the expected Guesswork for a source conditioned to create words in the typical set grows, with word length, at a lower exponential rate than that of the uniform approximation, suggesting use of the approximation is ill-advised."
1643158,13990,10192,Games of Timing Theoretical Protocol Development and Performance Analysis for Missile Defense,2013,"The games of timing theory enforcing optimal timing intervals and two optimal strategies will be expressed as the following two software theory generated protocols. The two optimal strategy software protocols are first, the battle manager must optimally allocate sensor and weapon systems with the threat launch events. This Internal Battle Manager Decision Optimization(BMDO) Protocol requires the threat constraints of (1) perceived threat inventory, (2) threat missile, and (3) ground asset being attacked. The theoretical generation of the games of timing optimal timing intervals and the two optimal strategies are derived realizing risk management equations within the BMDO Protocol optimization constraints solutions. Invariant Imbedding is the mathematical concept required to contain the BMDO Protocol within the Kernel of the games of timing optimal strategy and optimal timing interval solution to achieve the second and final optimal strategy protocol, the Optimal Battle Manager Decision(OBMD) Protocol. The performance analysis of the OBMD Protocol for constraints and requirements on processor capability and timeliness on a Network Centric Star Topology Architecture is also described for the two Models, Model 1 Mid-course Engagement scenario, and Model 2 Ascent Phase in the Target Trajectory."
698462,13990,22021,Information-theoretic study of voting systems,2013,"The typical paradigm in voting theory involves n voters and m candidates. Every voter ranks the candidates resulting in a permutation of the m candidates. A key problem is to derive the aggregate result of the voting. A popular method for vote aggregation is based on the Condorcet criterion. The Condorcet winner is the candidate who wins every other candidate by pairwise majority. However, the main disadvantage of this approach, known as the Condorcet paradox, is that such a winner does not necessarily exist since this criterion does not admit transitivity. This paradox is mathematically likely (if voters assign rankings uniformly at random, then with probability approaching one with the number of candidates, there will not be a Condorcet winner), however, in real life scenarios such as elections, it is not likely to encounter the Condorcet paradox. In this paper we attempt to improve our intuition regarding the gap between the mathematics and reality of voting systems. We study a special case where there is global intransitivity between all candidates. We introduce tools from information theory and derive an entropy-based characterization of global intransitivity. In addition, we tighten this characterization by assuming that votes tend to be similar; in particular they can be modeled as permutations that are confined to a sphere defined by the Kendalls τ distance."
809622,13990,20348,Cyclic network automata for indoor sensor network,2012,"Following Baryshnikov-Coffman-Kwak [1], we use network cyclic cellular automata to generate a decentralized protocol, with only a small fraction of sensors awake. The work here shows that waves of awake-state nodes turn corners and automatically solve  pusuit/evasion -type problems without centralized coordination."
1389569,13990,208,FailureSense: Detecting Sensor Failure Using Electrical Appliances in the Home,2014,"With the proliferation of inexpensive sensors, sensors are increasingly being used in smart homes. Recent experience on long term sensor deployment in residential homes has identified the potential risk of various types of sensor failure. Motivated by real examples, we develop new schemes to detect not only fail-stop failure, but obstructed-view and moved-location failures that are not the traditional fault detection foci. Our proposed solution, FailureSense, uses a novel idea of using electrical appliances to detect sensor failure at home. We learn the regular patterns of sensor firing with respect to appliance activation events and report a failure when we observe a significant deviation from the regularity. By using data from three real home deployments of over 71 days and 2818 recorded turn on and off events of 19 monitored appliances, we observe that FailureSense can detect obstructed-view, moved-location, and fail-stop failures with 82.84%, 90.53%, and 86.87% precision, respectively, with an average of 88.81% recall."
1672005,13990,9015,Opo: a wearable sensor for capturing high-fidelity face-to-face interactions,2014,"Currently, researchers study face-to-face interactions using wearable sensors and smartphones which provide 2 to 5 m proximity sensing every 20 to 300 s. However, studying interaction distance, which is known to impact disease spread, communication behavior, and other phenomenon, has proven challenging. Smartphones are limited by their inaccurate and/or impractical ranging capabilities, while wearable sensors are limited by their need for infrastructure nodes, bulkiness, and/or inaccurate ranging. To address these challenges, we present Opo, a 14 cm 2 , 11.4 g lapel pin built from commercial components. Opo sensors range neighbors every 2 s up to 2 m away with 5% average error, all while requiring zero infrastructure and improving upon current wearable sensors' accuracy and power usage. The cornerstone of Opo is an ultrasonic wakeup circuit that draws 19 μA when no neighbors are present. This enables Opo sensors to discover and range neighbors without the need for infrastructure nodes and slow or power-hungry RF discovery protocols. Thus, Opo is able to sense interaction distance with high accuracy (5 cm) and temporal fidelity (2 s) on a limited power budget."
1419443,13990,208,Dynamic configuration of mobile cloud middleware based on traffic load,2012,"The increasing demand of the mobile applications for processing power, storage space and energy saving have led them in adapting the cloud. To ease the offloading of these resource-intensive activities to the cloud, we have developed the Mobile Cloud Middleware (MCM), which also helps in combining services from multiple clouds. While MCM is shown to be horizontally scalable, the dynamic loads of telecommunication networks demand for identifying ideal topology and hot re-configuration of the deployment. The paper proposes the characteristics to be considered for identifying the topology and using concurrent languages like Erlang for adapting the topology dynamically."
1374156,13990,208,Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System for Wildlife Radio Collar Tracking,2014,"This paper describes a low cost system for tracking wildlife that is equipped with radio collars. Currently, researchers have to physically go into the field with a directional antenna to try to pinpoint the VHF (very high frequency) signal originating from a wildlife tracking collar. Depending on the terrain, it could take an entire day to locate a single animal. To vastly improve upon this traditional approach, the system proposed here utilizes a small fixed-wing aircraft drone with a simple radio on-board, flying an automated mission. Received signal strength is recorded, and used to create a heat map that shows the collar's position. A prototype of this system was built using off-the-shelf hardware and custom signal processing algorithms. Initial field tests confirm the systems capabilities and its promise for wildlife tracking."
1767599,13990,22021,Algebraic computation of pattern maximum likelihood,2011,"Pattern maximum likelihood (PML) is a technique for estimating the probability multiset of an unknown distribution. With any random sample, it associates the distribution maximizing the probability of its pattern. The required computation is a maximization of a monomial symmetric polynomial over the monotone simplex. The PML of only very few patterns have been found analytically, and for other patterns, the PML has been approximated by a heuristic algorithm. Taking an algebraic approach, we determine the PML of short patterns by solving a system of multivariate polynomial equations using the method of resultants. Using this approach, we determine the PML of the pattern 1112234, the last length-7 pattern whose PML was unknown. Under two plausible but yet unproved assumptions on the optimal alphabet size and the number of distinct probabilities, we also find the PML distribution of all previously unknown patterns of length up to 14."
1567136,13990,208,Towards Real World Aware Enterprise Systems - Reflecting the Quality Information of Physical Resources in Services and Processes,2011,"In order to facilitate the development of IoT-aware business processes that adapt to real-world context information, we present a novel modeling approach that reflects IoT quality information inherent in physical resources and maps them to the higher layers of enterprise information systems. Quality information is crucial to real-world applications, and is therefore part of standard real-world resource descriptions. Correspondingly, on a service level, quality aspects are referred to as Quality of Service (QoS) and are usually expressed by using Service Level Agreements that are unrelated to the quality information on a resource level. On a process level, quality aspects are currently much less considered, as IoT-aware business processes are still to emerge at a large scale. In order to bridge the gap between physical resources and business process management, we propose to map Quality of Information (QoI) and Quality of Actuation (QoA) common to the resource layer as important, non-functional Internet of Things (IoT) related aspects to the service and process layers in enterprise information systems. By following a bottom up approach, we investigate how standard modeling notations such as USDL and BPMN 2.0 can be integrated and augmented for handling the real world aspects QoI and QoA within IoT-aware business processes. Finally, we exemplify the proposed enhancements by a business process including IoT resources and services."
1163756,13990,208,"STIR-ing the wireless medium with self-tuned, inference-based, real-time jamming",2012,"Jamming broadcasting to intentionally interfere with wireless reception, has long been a problem for wireless systems. Recent research demonstrates numerous advances in jamming techniques that increase attack efficiency or reduce the probability an attack will be detected by choosing attack parameters based on a system's configuration. In this work, we extend the attacker's capabilities by modifying the attack parameters in response to the observed performance of the target system, effectively creating a feedback loop in our attack model. This framework allows for more intricate attack models that are tuned online allowing for closer to optimal attacks against legitimate systems. To show the feasibility of the listening and attacking framework we introduce an attack called Self-Tuned, Inference-based, Real-time jamming or STIR-jamming. This attack listens to legitimate communication traffic, infers the systems performance, and optimizes jamming parameters. We propose the two types of STIR-jamming, mSTIR-jamming and tSTIR-jamming, and implement these attacks against an IEEE 802.15.4 link as a case study. With the empirical results, we demonstrate the attack system adapting to various scenarios and finding stable solutions."
980379,13990,208,The Virtue of Patience: Offloading Topical Cellular Content through Opportunistic Links,2013,"Mobile data offloading is an approach to alleviating overloaded cellular traffic through alternative communication technologies on smartphones. Inspired by the prospect of spontaneous, peer-assisted, bulk data transfer through NFC or Wi-Fi Direct between proximate users' smartphones, we propose a model for mobile data offloading through the opportunistic proximity (e.g., Wi-Fi Direct) links with bounded content delivery delay and differential interests in content. Unlike the previous formulation of mobile data offloading as a target-set selection problem, which, essentially, asks the question who (will download the content through the cellular link), we ask who and when. We present methods for individual users to locally estimate (their and their acquaintances') topological importance on the opportunistic proximity-link-based networks and aggregated interests in content. These factors are consolidated into a time-dependent function that embodies the concept of users' patience for the content. Each individual user, then, periodically make a probabilistic cellular download decision based on its patience at that time. Our motivation and insights are: 1) Involving topologically important, but otherwise disinterested, users in downloading and forwarding content helps improve offloading efficiency, 2) situation awareness embodied in the time-dependent patience function is desirable, since it allows users to react to hard-to-predict contact opportunities on the fly. Through trace-driven simulations, we corroborate our insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in reducing cellular costs."
1273153,13990,208,Scientific Experiments with the Large Scale Open Testbed IoT-LAB: Broadcast with Network Coding,2014,"The demonstration presents a network coding broadcast protocol experiment running on a remote open testbed, IoT-LAB. The emphasis is on both parts, that are ideally fitting and complementary: the use of testbed IoT-LAB, and a protocol for broadcast with network coding. IoT-LAB is a very large scale testbed, remotely accessible, and includes a total of 2728 nodes (in 6 sites), the nodes are mostly of type wireless sensor nodes with one wireless radio transceiver, and are well suited to perform wireless protocol experiments. On the other hand, network coding is a technique perfectly fitted to multi-hop wireless networks with lossy links, in some cases and conditions, it may even outperform any scheme using routing (non-coding): we had designed a generic broadcast protocol, called DRAGONCAST based on network coding for such networks, and which minimizes the assumptions made of the networks. A variant of this protocol was run on IoT-LAB: some results were presented previously. The demonstration is a live demonstration of the protocol on the newer nodes of IoT-LAB."
1210300,13990,208,Demo of sensor deployment in detecting event's boundary,2012,"There are many ways to determine the boundary of an event based on Satellite imaging which does not provide accurate information. In many situations, there may not be enough time to monitor the effect of emergency and the affected area. Moreover, the event region could continuously change in the geographical region and a robust deployment of sensors is desirable that could capture maximum information about the entire event as soon as possible and continue capturing information without a break. These events are not physically accessible and most of the sensor deployments are static to check if they can fully cover an event. We explore these issues in this work and look at dynamic sensor network deployment strategies."
1288685,13990,208,A Lightweight SOAP over CoAP Transport Binding for Resource Constraint Networks,2011,"A huge momentum towards IP enabled Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) appeared through the emerging 6LoWPAN protocols (i.e. IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks). By using existing cross domain open standards in contrast of proprietary solutions, technologies and deployments are not tailored too tight for specific applications. Nevertheless, 6LoWPAN is only the first step. Still efforts on higher layers on top of 6LoWPAN are an urgent need to provide the seamless connectivity and interaction of highly resource constrained devices with higher valued applications and services. This paper describes a new approach to bind SOAP to the emerging Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) protocol. Thereby, CoAP provides a lightweight but reliable transport binding for SOAP. Compared to the widespread TCP based HTTP binding, round trip times can be reduced by 43% in an exemplary scenario because of the omitted expensive bidirectional TCP handshake mechanisms. Combined with dedicated XML compressors like EXI, SOAP based protocols become also applicable in WSNs."
1075819,13990,208,Accurate Pipeline Blockage Detection with Low-Cost Multi-modal Sensing,2014,"Industrial sensing applications place a premium on cost-effectiveness and accuracy. Traditional approaches often use expensive, invasive sensors from concern that inexpensive, non-invasive sensors will incur many false positives. High sensor cost leaves many lower value sites with sparse automation and no sensing. In this paper, we show how a combination of different types of sensors can provide reliable detection of industrial events while avoid false positives. Our use of multiple, low-cost sensors can enable greater levels of automation for these applications. We explore this problem by studying a specific application: blockages in oil flow lines common in cold weather. We sense changes in fluid flow from pipe skin temperature, and combine readings with acoustic data to avoid false positives and be robust to environmental changes. We demonstrate that our approach is effective with field experiments, and explore a broader range of problems in laboratory experiments. Our general approach applies to the classes of problems where false positives from one sensing modality can be resolved by multi-modal sensing."
768652,13990,208,CLAN: An Efficient Distributed Temporal Community Detection Protocol for MANETs,2014,"Real world MANETs often exhibit an inherent community structure in their topological connectivity and in the evolution of the topology over time. Such temporal community structure of MANETs has been shown to be extremely useful in improving the performance of routing and content-based routing in MANETs. However, detecting temporal communities in a completely distributed and real time manner is a hard problem, and it is often performed offline with knowledge of the full network topology over time. We propose CLAN, a distributed and real-time protocol for detecting temporal communities in MANETs. CLAN is an adaptation of the Label Propagation algorithm to distributed and time-varying graphs that MANETs are. A key novel component of CLAN is local rules for community rediscovery as the network evolves. CLAN also uses a weighted version of the network topology where the weights are defined using a novel notion of social entropy to promote stability of communities. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that CLAN is quick to converge, incurs minimal overhead and is as effective as centralized approaches to temporal community detection. We also demonstrate how the temporal community structure can be used by designing a hierarchical routing protocol that achieves the delivery ratio of the OLSR routing protocol at a fraction of the overhead."
1621702,13990,208,TALB: A Traffic-Aware Load Balancer for Throughput Improvement in Wireless Mesh Networks,2011,"In this paper we design, implement and evaluate a practical flow-based routing architecture for WMNs, called TALB, which exploits traffic measurements to balance traffic load over available mesh paths and gateways. To achieve throughput enhancements while mitigating inter-flow interference, TALB implements a \emph{Constrained Maximal Bottleneck Path} computation algorithm to maximize the bottleneck capacity of the paths used to reach the Internet, while preserving a given degree of traffic locality. The distinctive aspect of our proposed scheme is that it relies on a traffic-aware definition of residual link capacities to properly take into account the heterogeneity of Internet applications (e.g., inelastic vs. elastic traffic) and their service requirements (e.g., fixed vs. adaptive demands). Then, each mesh node monitors the main features of long-lived traffic flows, and reports such information to a network manager, which decides upon the sub-optimal paths to allocate to each new session. Tests performed in a 10-node wireless mesh testbed show that TALB provides remarkably throughput gains over nearest gateway strategies in case of mixed TCP and UDP traffic scenarios, or low to moderate load conditions."
1651443,13990,208,Building Cross-Layer Corridors in Wireless Multihop Networks,2014,"Corridor-based Routing widens traditional hop-by-hop paths to enable advanced physical layer mechanisms in Wireless Multihop Networks. The key concept is to let groups of nodes cooperate to jointly forward data. Instead of establishing a path formed by a fixed sequence of nodes, the network layer builds a corridor from source to destination to allow for such an approach. The corridor is divided into stages, which consist of the aforementioned groups of nodes. Existing mechanisms for Corridor-based Routing focus on the physical layer and assume a routing protocol that builds the corridor. In this paper, we design a corridor construction algorithm and a practical protocol that implements it. In particular, we address in detail the overhead introduced by our protocol, since this is crucial for performance and an open issue of Corridor-based Routing. We implement our approach both in simulation and practice. We obtain the turning point at which corridors become profitable and show that our protocol builds corridors, which enable throughput gains up to 74%."
874245,13990,20348,Fault detection in wireless sensor networks: a hybrid approach,2012,"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployment experiences show that data collected is prone to be imprecise and faulty due to internal and external influences, such as battery drain, environmental interference, sensor aging. An early detection of such faults is necessary for the effective operation of the sensor network. In this preliminary work, we propose a hybrid approach to the detection of faults and we illustrate its performance on data coming from a real sensor deployment. The proposal is a first step to have a hybrid method towards automated on-line fault detection and classification in context-aware WSNs middleware framework."
1603888,13990,208,Towards A Reconfigurable Cyber Physical System,2014,"A reconfigurable, low-cost Cyber Physical System (CPS) that reuses the same hardware for multiple applications is presented in this demo. Grid Eye (high-precision, infrared-array sensor) is employed to support multiple applications and to demonstrate the CPS reconfiguration capability. The user interface of our system is designed to improve the accessibility of the CPS for those students, engineers, and practitioners who do not have deep knowledge about the hardware implementation in different domains such as medical, civil, and mechanical engineerings. A generic hardware and software design pattern is adapted to interface with any type of sensor."
2803255,13990,208,A hybrid fault detection approach for context-aware wireless sensor networks,2012,"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployment experiences show that data collected is prone to be imprecise and faulty due to internal and external influences, such as battery drain, environmental interference, sensor aging. An early detection of such faults is necessary for the effective operation of the sensor network. We focus on identifying data fault types and their causes. In particular, we propose a hybrid approach to the detection of faults based on three qualitatively different classes of fault detection methods. Rule-based methods leverage domain and expert knowledge to develop heuristic rules for identifying and classifying faults. Estimation methods predict normal sensor behavior by leveraging sensor spatial and temporal correlations, identifying erroneous sensor readings as faults. Finally, learning-based methods are inferred a model for the faulty sensor readings using training data and statistically detect and identify classes of faults. We illustrate the performance of a hybrid approach on data coming from two actual sensor deployments."
1852906,13990,30,Leveraging Social System Networks in Ubiquitous High-Data-Rate Health Systems,2011,"Social system networks with high data rates and limited storage will discard data if the system cannot connect and upload the data to a central server. We address the challenge of limited storage capacity in mobile health systems during network partitions with a heuristic that achieves efficiency in storage capacity by modifying the granularity of the medical data during long intercontact periods. Patterns in the connectivity, reception rate, distance, and location are extracted from the social system network and leveraged in the global algorithm and online heuristic. In the global algorithm, the stochastic nature of the data is modeled with maximum likelihood estimation based on the distribution of the reception rates. In the online heuristic, the correlation between system position and the reception rate is combined with patterns in human mobility to estimate the intracontact and intercontact time. The online heuristic performs well with a low data loss of 2.1%-6.1%."
1247531,13990,208,RFID Based Acoustic Wake-Up System for Underwater Sensor Networks,2011,This paper presents a new Acoustic-Triggered Wake-Up system specially useful to Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks built with low-power consumption architectures. The work includes both the wake-up system description and a comparison with previous works carried out under similar features. These comparisons demonstrate the energy benefits of this new system which requires no additional hardware within the transmission and a single but efficient AT-WUp module in the reception.
1487471,13990,208,Modeling spatial node density in waypoint mobility,2012,"This paper introduces a modeling framework to analyze spatial node density in mobile networks under “waypoint”-like mobility regimes. The proposed framework is based on a set of first order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that take as parameters (1) the probability of going from one subregion of the mobility domain to another and (2) the rate at which a node decides to leave a given subregion. We validate our model by using it to describe the steady-state behavior of real user mobility recorded by GPS traces in different scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first node density modeling framework generic enough that can be applied to any “waypoint”-based mobility regime."
1517837,13990,208,Eagle eye: A dual-radio architecture in delay tolerant networks,2012,"In most delay tolerant network (DTN) applications, mobile nodes utilize WiFi radios to obtain local information and transmit data. One bottleneck on DTN delivery performance is the short communication range of the WiFi radio. Rather than designing efficient protocols on WiFi based DTN, we propose a novel dual-radio architecture by adding a long-range low-bitrate eagle eye (EE) radio on every node. This EE radio can “see” real-time movement information of nodes in a significantly large range, and so much early scheduling can be done with this radio when compared with WiFi which is still in charge of data transmissions. Benefiting from this cooperative dual radios architecture, we design distributed EE routing protocol for minimizing delivery delay in DTNs. Through our prototype implementation with 7 EE devices and simulations based on real trace data of 4000 taxis in Shanghai, we show that the proposed architecture is able to achieve as low as 40% of the average delay with traditional DTNs."
1091387,13990,208,On the Invariance of Spatial Node Density for Realistic Mobility Modeling,2011,"In this paper we show that human mo- bility exhibits persistent behavior in terms of the spatial density distribution of the mobile nodes over time. Using real mobility traces, we observe that the original non-homogeneous node spatial density distribution, where some regions may be quite dense while others may be completely deserted, is main- tained at different instants of time. We also show that mobility models that select the next node position based on the position of other nodes, a la preferential attachment, do not preserve the original spatial node density distribution and lead to behavior similar to random mobility as exemplified by the Random Waypoint model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these phenomena have been reported. Based on these observations, we propose a simple mobility model that preserves the desired spatial density distribution. Moreover, when simu- lating the operation of a network moving according to the proposed model, we found that performance results expressed by a number of network metrics also match closely results obtained under mobility governed by real traces. We also compare our results to models whose steady-state do not preserve the original non-homogeneous density distribution and show that network performance under such regimes deviates from performance under real trace mobility."
437214,13990,293,The efficacy of path loss models for fixed rural wireless links,2011,"In this paper we make use of a large set of measurements from a production wireless network in rural New Zealand to analyze the performance of 28 path loss prediction models, published over the course of 60 years. We propose five metrics to determine the performance of each model. We show that the state of the art, even for the simple case of rural environments, is surprisingly ill-equipped to make accurate predictions. After combining the best elements of the best models and hand-tuning their parameters, we are unable to achieve an accuracy of better than 12 dB root mean squared error (RMSE)--four orders of magnitude away from ground truth."
895850,13990,208,Distributed Compressive Detection with Perfect Secrecy,2014,"This paper considers the problem of distributed compressive detection under a perfect secrecy constraint. More specifically, we consider the problem where the distributed inference network operates in the presence of an eavesdropper who wants to discover the state of the nature being monitored by the system. It is shown that perfect secrecy can be achieved by using cooperating trustworthy nodes that assist the Fusion Center (FC) by providing falsified data to the eavesdroppers.

We obtain a convenient two-term expression for the channel dispersion which shows that, unlike the capacity, it depends crucially on the dynamics of the fading process."
1997249,13990,10228,Performance of linear-quadratic detectors in spectrum sensing,2013,Channel-modeling uncertainties may affect the performance of spectrum sensing in cognitive-radio applications. Negative effects of these uncertainties may be mitigated by an appropriate choice of the sensor operation. We show how the use of a linear-quadratic detector can improve the performance of both linear and quadratic spectrum sensors. The robustness to model uncertainties of the linear-quadratic detector is studied using moment-bound theory.

2055359,13990,22164,Changes in saccade kinematics associated with the value and novelty of a stimulus,2012,"The kinematics of elementary movements such as saccadic eye movements are highly regular across repeated movements and across individuals. Historically, saccades have been viewed as following a fixed kinematic pattern with a characteristic peak velocity and duration that varies only with the amplitude of movement. Here we show experimentally in humans that saccade peak velocity and duration can be modulated through presenting stimuli of differing intrinsic value, and that repetition of the same stimulus leads to a decline in saccade speed which we interpret as a decline in the value of that stimulus. Surprisingly, we find that, among saccades of comparable amplitude, faster movement is associated with lower variability - contradicting the idea of a speed-accuracy tradeoff. We consider these results in the context of theoretical models that attempt to account for saccade durations through balancing costs that penalize accuracy with costs that penalize movement duration."

1582171,13990,8839,"Indexing the real world: sensing, big data and mobility",2013,"In this presentation, Dr. Henry Tirri, EVP & CTO of Nokia and UC Berkeley will discuss insights into the social and scientific implications of the technology trends being driven by the rise of large scale multi-device cloud-based computing. The cloud has already fundamentally transformed everyday experiences visible to consumers through their access to streaming media, social networking and location services via multiple different computing devices, from phones and tablets to connected accessories. As bits continue to eat atoms, more elements of the physical world will turn first into code and then into code that lives in the cloud. This is driven by the enormous advantages in sharing, indexing and elasticity of computing code has with respect to physical objects. We have seen this happening to photos and videos, music and books, but this is only the beginning. Consumers will increasingly turn to connected experiences that will in turn produce a wealth of data at a at rate unprecedented in the history of mankind. Due to the pervasiveness of this change, the next phase of the cloud era will see increased partnerships between public and private sectors around long-term technology trends in areas ranging from urban planning to health care. It can be anticipated that connected hardware will continue to diversify, with an increased emphasis on multi-sensing. Wearables, sensor clusters in vehicles and smart devices, and independent sensors will all become first class citizens of the cloud: both feeding data into it and drawing it back out again. We will look at one exciting example of this trend -- indexing of the real world made possible by global scale location services. We argue that ultimately computing will totally de-centralize and live throughout a heterogeneous cloud-based architecture, but energy will continue to be the One Ring to Rule Them All, that will define where in the cloud the execution happens."
1261078,13990,22021,Quantum Codes and Symplectic Matroids,2014,"The correspondence between linear codes and representable matroids is well known. But a similar correspondence between quantum codes and matroids is not known. We show that representable symplectic matroids over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ correspond to $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear quantum codes. Although this connection is straightforward, it does not appear to have been made earlier in literature. The correspondence is made through isotropic subspaces. We also show that the popular Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are essentially the homogenous symplectic matroids while the graph states, which figure so prominently in measurement based quantum computation, correspond to a special class of symplectic matroids, namely Lagrangian matroids. This association is useful in that it enables the study of symplectic matroids in terms of quantum codes and vice versa. Furthermore, it has application in the study of quantum secret sharing schemes."
884519,13990,8228,Stochastic cargo transport by molecular motors in molecular communication,2012,"This paper investigates, through computer simulations, statistical behavior of molecular motors transporting cargos on a network of protein filaments in an engineered environment. This paper also examines how molecular motors' statistical behavior is applied to building. a molecular communication system. A molecular motor, such as kinesin, is a protein complex. It exists in eukaryotic cells and functions as a nano-scale autonomous nanomachine that carries nano-scale to micro-scale signaling molecules on a network of protein filaments (i.e., cytoskeletal network) in eukaryotic cells. At an intersection of protein filaments on a cytoskeletal network, a molecular motor shows stochastic movement and may stay on the current protein filament or may switch onto an intersecting protein filament, resulting in stochastic delivery of signaling molecules from the nucleus to organelles over a cytoskeletal network. Molecular communication is an engineered system to transmit information by modulating information on molecules and by transporting modulated molecules from senders to receivers. One of promising approaches to building a molecular communication system is to use molecular motors to transport information-modulated molecules on an engineered protein filament network connecting senders and receivers. In order to examine the feasibility of this approach, this paper simulated statistical behavior of molecular motors carrying cargo molecules through multiple protein filament intersections on a protein filament network. Simulations model stochastic movement of a molecular motor at a single intersection of protein filaments using the measurement data obtained through in vitro experiments (using kinesins and microtubules) conducted by the authors of this paper and evaluates the stochastic delivery of molecules from the senders to the receivers over multiple intersections of protein filaments arranged in an array topology. Simulation results show that molecular motors stochastically deliver cargo molecules to a specific receiver (or to a specific set of receivers) with a given probability over an array of protein filament intersections."
1930528,13990,20348,Demonstration abstract: simply RIOT: teaching and experimental research in the internet of things,2014,"Abstract--Manufacturers announce on a regular basis the availability of novel tiny devices, most of them featuring network interfaces: the Internet of Things (IoT) is already here -- from the hardware perspective. On the software side however, embedded platforms available so far made it uneasy for developers to build apps that run across heterogeneous IoT hardware. Linux does not scale down to small, energy-constrained devices, while alternatives such as Contiki yield a steep learning curve and lengthy development life-cycles because they rule out standard programming and debugging tools. RIOT is a new open source software platform bridging this gap. RIOT allows just about any programmer to develop IoT application with zero learning curve. This is achieved by allowing standard C and C++ application programming with multi-threading, using well-known debugging tools (gdb, Valgrind, profilers etc.), while requiring only a minimum of 1.5 kB of RAM. RIOT also provides built-in energy efficiency and real-time capabilities. These characteristics make this platform attractive in several contexts, including teaching in the field of the Internet of Things, and experimental research in the domain of sensor networks and the IoT."
2724939,13990,22021,Extendable MDL,2013,In this paper we show that a combination of the minimum description length principle and an exchange-ability condition leads directly to the use of Jeffreys prior. This approach works in most cases even when Jeffreys prior cannot be normalized. Kraft's inequality links codes and distributions but a closer look at this inequality demonstrates that this link only makes sense when sequences are considered as prefixes of potential longer sequences. For technical reasons only results for exponential families are stated. Results on when Jeffreys prior can be normalized after conditioning on a initializing string are given. An exotic case where no initial string allow Jeffreys prior to be normalized is given and some way of handling such exotic cases are discussed.
2555033,13990,22021,On essentially conditional information inequalities,2011,"In 1997, Z. Zhang and R.W. Yeung found the first example of a conditional information inequality in four variables that is not “Shannon-type”. This linear inequality for entropies is called conditional (or constraint) since it holds only under condition that some linear equations are satisfied for the involved entropies. Later, the same authors and other researchers discovered several unconditional information inequalities that do not follow from Shannon's inequalities for entropy. In this paper we show that some non Shannon-type conditional inequalities are “essentially” conditional, i.e., they cannot be extended to any unconditional inequality. We prove one new essentially conditional information inequality for Shannon's entropy and discuss conditional information inequalities for Kolmogorov complexity."
1242216,13990,208,Two Families of Algorithms to Film Sport Events with Flying Robots,2013,"In this paper, we introduce two families of distributed algorithms to control the movement of groups of flying robots that are monitoring an event by moving over the field where the event takes place, while optimizing some specific objective. In order to show the effectiveness of our algorithms, we formulate the Sport Event Filming (SEF) problem. The objective of the problem is to maximize the satisfaction of event viewers while minimizing the distance traveled by the camera-drones. We propose two families of solutions to solve the dynamic version of the problem, where the flying robots do not have any knowledge of the input sequence and move in reaction to the movements of the protagonists of the event. The first family (Nearest Neighbor)is based on a technique used in robotic systems, whereas the second family (Ball Movement Interception) is designed based on specific characteristics of the SEF problem. We present extensive simulation results for both families in terms of average viewer satisfaction and travelled distance for the flying robots, when several parameters vary."

Furthermore, we show that free subsystem codes over a finite chain ring cannot perform better than those over a finite field."
1639933,13990,208,Bugs or anomalies? Sequence mining based debugging in wireless sensor networks,2012,"WSN applications are prone to bugs and failures due to their typical characteristics, such as being extensively distributed, heavily concurrent, and resource restricted. In this paper, we propose and develop a flexible and iterative WSN debugging system based on sequence mining techniques. At first, we develop a data structure called the vectorized Probabilistic Suffix Tree (vPST), an elastic model to extract and store sequential information from program runtime traces in compact suffix tree based vectors. Then, we build a novel WSN debugging system by integrating vPST with Support Vector Machines (SVM), a robust and generic classifier for both linear and nonlinear data classification tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that the vPST-SVM debugging system is efficient, flexible, and generic by three different test cases, two on the LiteOS operating system and one on the TinyOS operating system."
1621951,13990,208,Service and Experiment: Towards a Perpetual Sensor Network Testbed without Backchannel,2011,"The sensor network testbeds available today rely on a communication channel different from the mote radio - a backchannel - to facilitate mote reprogramming, health monitoring and performance analysis. Such backchannels are either supported as wired communication channels (USB or Ethernet), or via an extra board coupled to the mote under test and thus introduce significant constraint on the testbed setup and on the mote power budget. With Greenlab, we wish to study the performance behavior of outdoor sensor networks where energy is harvested from the environment. We thus cannot rely on a backchannel. In this paper, we present the design of the central mechanisms needed to support Greenlab and their implementation in TinyOS. These mechanisms are based on a dichotomy between a service mode, where each mote is participating in testbed management, and an experimentation mode, where each mote is fully participating in a user-defined experiment. We evaluate performance by analyzing the overhead our approach introduces."
1490302,13990,208,Opportunistic Coding for Multi-Packet Flooding in Wireless Sensor Networks with Correlated Links,2014,"In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), existing work on flooding mainly focuses on single-packet problem, while work in sequential multi-packet problem is surprisingly little. This paper proposes OppCode, a new opportunistic network-coding based flooding architecture for multi-packet dissemination in WSNs, where both unreliable and correlated links commonly exist. Instead of flooding a single packet each time, each node encodes multiple native packets chosen from a specific fixed-size page to an encoded packet, and then rebroadcasts it further. The key idea consists of two parts: one is opportunistically coding decision, in which each node grasps every possible coding opportunity greedily to conduct an encode-and-forward operation in order to maximize its total (or aggregate) coding gain of all neighbors based on the probabilistic estimations of packets each neighbor already has (i.e., coverage), the other is paged collective acknowledgements (ACKs), in which one rebroadcast that arrives at a receiver acts as not only an implicit ACK of successful disseminations of all packets in the entire page for the sender, but also probabilistic ACK to update page-scale per-packet coverage estimations for its neighbors in a batch. We evaluate our design using extensive simulations and on a 20-node WSNs testbed, and show that OppCode largely increases performance of multi-packet flooding compared with state-of-the-art solutions, especially when links are highly unreliable and correlated with each other. The gains vary from a few percent to several folds depending on the network density, link conditions, coverage threshold and page size."
1059322,13990,208,Droplet: A New Denial-of-Service Attack on Low Power Wireless Sensor Networks,2013,"In this paper we present a new kind of Denial-of-Service attack against the PHY layer of low power wireless sensor networks. Overcoming the very limited range of jamming-based attacks, this attack can penetrate deep into a target network with high power efficiency. We term this the Droplet attack, as it attains enormous disruption by dropping small, payload-less frame headers to its victim's radio receiver, depriving the latter of bandwidth and sleep time. We demonstrate the Droplet attack's high damage rate to full duty-cycle receivers, and further show that a high frequency version of Droplet can even force nodes running on very low duty-cycle MAC protocols to drop most of their packets."

GasNet provides low-latency and reliable gas leak ALARM message delivery in complicated RF environments. It does so through ROAP, a novel opportunistic forwarding mechanism considering link correlation. ROAP leverages a hop tree in opportunistic forwarder list selection to ensure the shortest hops to the sink. Furthermore, link correlation is used to obtain more accurate forwarding probability and to achieve fast retransmission. We implement the prototype of GasNet in campus testbed and evaluate its performance via extensive experiments. The experiment results show that ROAP achieves 100% gas leak ALARM message delivery in low latency."
873870,13990,208,On the spanning ratio of partial Delaunay triangulation,2012,"Partial Delaunay triangulation (PDT) is a well-known subgraph construction that has already been used for years in the context of geographic routing and topology control. So far, it has been unknown if partial Delaunay triangulation is a network spanner. Network spanners are those subgraph constructions which maintain the length of the shortest path between any pair of nodes up to a constant factor. This factor is also referred to as the spanning ratio. In this work we prove that partial Delaunay triangulation is a network spanner for unit disk graphs. Furthermore, from our proof follows immediately that the spanning ratio of PDT is less than or equal to 1+√5/4 π 2 ."
1794314,13990,208,Wardrop Equilibrium Formulation of Resource-Constrained DTN Routing in Public Safety Networks,2011,"In this paper, we investigate the ability of using Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) in Public Safety networks where bandwidth and storage are constrained. We formalize the problem as a Wardrop equilibrium over a time-discretized graph. Driven by our findings, we propose RECOR, a centralized REsource-Constrained ORacle-based DTN routing mechanism which spreads the demand across multiple store-carry forward paths to satisfy the node storage and link transport constraints observed in intervention situations. By applying the proposed mechanism to real Bluetooth-based DTN traces, we show that the transmission bottleneck can be compensated, but only up to a certain extent, by increasing storage capacity and delay. We also analyze the benefit of strategies that provide more resources to highly connected nodes (e.g. ambulances and firetrucks) which can then feed incentives and policies for DTN network engineering. Finally, the idea presented here is general and suggests the necessity of trace-driven simulation and specific modeling tools for appropriate design of future DTN resource management policies. © 2011 IEEE."
1465311,13990,208,WX-MAC: An Energy Efficient MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks,2013,"In this poster, we propose a novel energy efficient asynchronous MAC protocol for WSNs-WX-MAC. WX-MAC supports nodes to exchange their sampling schedules by query and report mechanisms. With the aid of neighbors' information and strobed preamble approach, WX-MAC shortens senders' preamble before data transmission and reduces nodes' wakeup duration. WX-MAC not only reduces the energy consumption on the senders and targets, but also decreases the possibility of overhearing on the surrounding neighbors, leading to a further energy conservation. Preliminary simulations have shown that WX-MAC saves more energy than B-MAC, Wise MAC, and X-MAC."

697534,13990,208,A Cooperative Routing Framework Based on Randomized Coding in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks,2011,"A distributed cooperative forwarding framework based on randomized coding is proposed, where cooperative links are formed and packets are forwarded on the fly, without explicit relay selection, actuation or resource allocation. In this framework, a cooperative flooding method and two cooperative forwarding schemes that actuate the cooperative transmissions of the nodes within an optimally formed progress region are described. It is shown that by assuring packets' progress cooperatively through a region instead of a string of predetermined nodes, progress of the packets towards the final destination is guaranteed even in sparse networks, under severe fading and mobility conditions. The proposed forwarding schemes are shown to provide reductions in the total number of hops, while causing minimal spatial footprint on the network."
1602940,13990,208,Navigating in Signal Space: A Crowd-Sourced Sensing Map Construction for Navigation,2014,"Indoor navigation is typically achieved by an operational localization system among a range of location-based services it provides. However, the construction of a localization map, which is prerequisite for binding sensed observation in sensing space to individual locations in geographic space, remains a challenging task to date. In this work, we propose an indoor navigation system that alleviates the need for constructing a localization map and instead provides navigation in signal space. The main idea behind our approach is to construct a sensing map consisting of signal observations (WiFi Clusters) and connecting dead-reckoning segments obtained through mobile sensing capabilities (traces of accelerometer and digital compass reading). To this end, we design a prototype to demonstrate effective construction of such sensing map with energy-efficient sensors and crowd-sourcing, and its ability to support accurate navigation."
1101431,13990,208,A General Data and Acknowledgement Dissemination Scheme in Mobile Social Networks,2014,"In this paper, a general data and acknowledgement dissemination mechanism is proposed in mobile social networks (MSNs). Most existing dissemination schemes in MSNs only consider data transmission. However, receiving acknowledgement has many potential applications in MSNs (e.g., mobile trade and incentive mechanism). Challenging problems thus arise due to this type of mixed messages (i.e., data and acknowledgement) dissemination problem. The buffer constraint and time constraint for data and acknowledgement make this problem even harder to handle in a practical scenario. In order to maximize the research objective (e.g., low delay and high delivery ratio), we have to identify the priority of each message in the network. We propose a general priority-based compare-split routing scheme to solve the above buffer exchange problem. During each contact opportunity, first, nodes compare their abilities to send data and acknowledgements based on two types of criteria. They are the contact probability and the social status, which estimate the nodes' direct and indirect relationship with destinations respectively. Nodes then decide which message to exchange, and thus maximize the combined probability. Second, an adaptive priority-based exchange scheme is proposed within each type of message, and so is the relative priority between two types of messages, as to decide the order of exchange. The message with a high priority will be forwarded first, and thus maximize the research objectives. The effectiveness of our scheme is verified through the extensive simulations in synthetic and real traces."

Significant mismatches in clutter and sensor field of view model parameters results in biased estimates. In this paper we propose a multi-target filtering solution that can accommodate non-linear target model and unknown non-homogeneous clutter intensity and sensor field-of-view. Our solution is based on the multi-target multi-Bernoulli filter that adaptively learns non-homogeneous clutter intensity and sensor field-of-view while filtering.

Our strategy is to find capacity approximations for the corresponding network in the discrete superposition model and to use the fact that those are an approximation for the Gaussian capacity. The gap between our approximation and the Gaussian capacity is a constant depending only on the number of relays, hence it is a valuable characterization for the regime of high SNR and high rate."

1704871,13990,22288,A Service Identifier parsing mechanism for Universal Network based on BHO,2012,"In Universal Network, SID (Service Identifier) is the unique description for service or resource without any locator messages, which is different from URL (Universal Resource Locator) on the Internet. The SID parsing mechanism plays the most important role in Universal Network. In this paper, we propose a SID Parsing mechanism (SIDP) by making use of BHO plug-in to parse SIDs into corresponding CID (Connection Identifier). By collecting the SIDs required from the Internet Explorer browser in Windows OS, SIDP parses the SIDs into corresponding CIDs so as to access service or obtain resource for users. Experimental results show that SIDP system can easily and accurately parse SID into CID and will efficiently reduce the load of server especially to some popular services and resources."
1580940,13990,22164,Predicting discrimination of formant frequencies in vowels with a computational model of the auditory midbrain,2012,"Neural information for encoding and processing temporal information in speech sounds occurs over different time-courses. We are interested in temporal mechanisms for neural coding of both pitch and formant frequencies of voiced sounds such as vowels. In particular, in this study we will describe a strategy for quantifying the ability to discriminate changes in spectral peaks, or formant frequencies, based on the responses of neural models. Previous studies have explored this question based on responses of computational models for the auditory periphery, that is, responses of the population of auditory-nerve (AN) fibers (e.g. [1]–[2]). In this study we quantify formant-frequency discrimination based on the responses of models for auditory midbrain neurons at the level of the inferior colliculus (IC). These neurons are tuned to both audio frequency and to low-frequency amplitude modulations, such as those associated with pitch."
1501525,13990,8228,Collaborative wireless nanobots for tumor discovery and drug delivery,2012,"Current approaches in combating cancer employ nanoparticle-based therapies that harness biological and chemical phenomena to deliver anticancer drugs. Successful studies have shown the utility of leveraging biochemical cues to recruit nanoparticles to the tumor microenvironment. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using collaborative wireless nanobots or WiNoBots to efficiently target and accumulate at the site of tumor tissues. Unlike biological and chemical approaches, nanobots directly communicate with each other via wireless signals. Signaling nanobots emit a wireless signal to receiving nanobots, which move in the direction of the electric field gradient. Together these nanobots concert a collaborative action to home to the site of a signal. Using computer simulations, we show that collaborative wireless signaling produces an aggregate wavefront that reduces the mean path length that nanobots travel to reach the site of a diseased tissue. Our results motivate further studies of these unique nanobot wireless systems, which may be able to confine and concentrate a therapeutic response."

2304453,13990,22164,A continuum computational model of mitotic matrix formation,2011,"Mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation are dynamic processes that require microtubules (MTs), MT-associated motors, MT-binding proteins, and chromosomes to coordinate with each other. Because of the complexity of the system, a thorough understanding of the principles that govern mitotic spindle formation remains elusive. Computational models in biology present an attractive tool to deal with complexity, allowing testing of different hypotheses. Here we developed a computational spatially heterogeneous model of known biochemical interactions involved in spindle formation. Using this model, we investigate the effect that individual species have on spindle morphology and chromosome segregation. Finally, we show the impact that Lamin B, thought to be a component of the long-sought-after spindle matrix, has on spindle formation during mitosis."

510535,13990,9913,Blink detection using Doppler sensor,2014,"There have been a lot of attention paid to health and safety, such as dry eye syndrome or falling asleep while driving. Blinks are the physiological signal that reflects the degree of concentration or drowsiness, and thus the blink detection system is expected to get blink information. In many blink detection systems it is necessary to contact the equipment or use with a camera and the feeling of oppression and resistance will arise. In this paper, we propose the contactless blink detection system with Doppler sensor. With the setting of the threshold for each person and the classification of a blink and non-blink, the proposed system can detect and count blinks. It is shown that the system achieves the recall rate of 92 % as for the detection accuracy by experiment."
2057874,13990,10192,Video Games at the Library: A Historical Perspective,2011,"We present an overview or the video games available at the Film Library of Bologna. This institution, in collaboration with the University of Bologna, has a whole collateral branch dedicated to the video games, as they can be considered a recreational activity somehow related to movies. This collection of video games conceptually starts from the ones that are strictly connected to movies, and then expands to a wider class of video games. A video game could be related with a movie either as its direct inspiration, its prequel or collateral plot, or also be created as a direct consequence of that movie. The expansion of the collection available in the Library includes a historical set of video games. In this paper we discuss the historical perspective of the relationship between technology and video games, providing a complete historical view of the video games by means of the titles and the consoles available in the Library. Several dedicated consoles are still in working conditions and could be used by the visitors of the Library."
433695,13990,20592,Automating network monitoring on experimental testbeds,2011,"Despite experimental testbeds' rapid growth and continued strong demand by researchers, the power of testbeds can be further increased by providing additional tools to help experimenters instrument their experiments. Experimenters with improved instrumentation support can deepen their understanding of experiment operation, and have an easier task of generating high quality datasets to share with the community.#R##N##R##N#We introduce a prototype tool that automatically deploys an instrumentation overlay on an existing testbed experiment. Netflowize modifies instantiated experiments to collect experiment-wide flow statistics. The resources consumed by the flow collection process are specified by the experimenter. NetFlow records are widely used by the networking and security research communities for tasks ranging from traffic engineering to detecting anomalous behaviors associated with zero-day attacks. We discuss tool design and implementation, present usage examples, and highlight the many challenges of auto-deploying an experiment-wide monitoring infrastructure."
1116538,13990,22021,Minimization of entropy functionals revisited,2012,Integral functionals based on convex normal integrands are minimized subject to finitely many moment constraints. The integrands are assumed to be strictly convex but not autonomous or differentiable. The effective domain of the value function is described by a modification of the concept of convex core. The minimization is viewed as a primal problem and studied together with a dual one in the framework of convex duality. Main results assume a dual constraint qualification but dispense with the primal constraint qualification. Minimizers and generalized minimizers are explicitly described whenever the primal value is finite. Existence of a generalized dual solution is established whenever the dual value is finite. A generalized Pythagorean identity is presented using Bregman distance and a correction term. Results are applied to minimization of Bregman distances.
831283,13990,22164,Figure-ground classification based on spectral properties of boundary image patches,2012,"Image understanding requires segregation of the visual scene into perceptual objects. Due to the projection of the three-dimensional world on two-dimensional sensor surfaces, objects closer to the observer occlude those which are more distant. At any given occlusion border, it is important to decide which side is the foreground (figure) and which is the background, a decision which is influenced both by global and local image contents. In this report, we focus on local cues. We randomly select small image patches located on figure-ground borders in complex natural scenes. Spectral anisotropy features are extracted from the patches and used to train a non-linear Support Vector Machine. Using data from two large image databases (LabelMe and BSDS300), the classifier achieves an accuracy near 70% per local patch on the task of deciding which side of an occlusion is the foreground. Although in many cases global influences are important for figure-ground segregation, we suggest that the low computational cost of local computation can make it a useful strategy for figure-ground segregation."
1328248,13990,208,Optimal Prizes for All-Pay Contests in Heterogeneous Crowdsourcing,2014,"Incentive is key to the success of crowd sourcing which heavily depends on the level of user participation. This paper designs an incentive mechanism to motivate a heterogeneous crowd of users to actively participate in crowd sourcing campaigns. We cast the problem in a new, asymmetric all-pay contest model with incomplete information, where an arbitrary n of users exert irrevocable effort to compete for a prize tuple. The prize tuple is an array of prize functions as opposed to a single constant prize typically used by conventional contests. We design an optimal contest that (a) induces the maximum profit -- total user effort minus the prize payout -- for the crowdsourcer, and (b) ensures users to strictly have incentive to participate. In stark contrast to intuition and prior related work, our mechanism induces an equilibrium in which heterogeneous users behave independently of one another as if they were in a homogeneous setting. This newly discovered property, which we coin as strategy autonomy (SA), is of practical significance: it (a) reduces computational and storage complexity by n-fold for each user, (b) increases the crowdsourcer's revenue by counteracting an effort reservation effect existing in asymmetric contests, and (c) neutralizes the (almost universal) law of diminishing marginal returns (DMR). Through an extensive numerical case study, we demonstrate and scrutinize the superior profitability of our mechanism, as well as draw insights into the SA property."
2381258,13990,20348,Simbeeotic: a simulator and testbed for micro-aerial vehicle swarm experiments,2012,"ABSTRACT Micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) swarms are an emerging class of mobile sensing systems. Simulation and staged deployment to prototype testbeds are useful in the early stages of large-scale system design, when hardware is unavailable or deployment at scale is impractical. To faithfully represent the problem domain, a MAV swarm simulator must be able to model the key aspects of the sys-tem: actuation, sensing, and communication. We present Simbee-otic, a simulation framework geared toward modeling swarms of MAVs. Simbeeotic enables algorithm development and rapid MAV prototyping through pure simulation and hardware-in-the-loop ex-perimentation. We demonstrate that Simbeeotic provides the appropriate level of fidelity to evaluate prototype systems while maintaining the ability to test at scale."
1026222,13990,22164,Predictive analysis of two tone stream segregation via extended Kalman filter,2013,"Hearing engages in a seemingly effortless way, complex processes that allow our brains to parse the acoustic environment around us into perceptual sound objects, in a phenomenon called streaming or stream segregation. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that the auditory system relies on the regularity inherent to each stream to segregate it from other competing streams in the scene. Tracking these regularities is achieved via a recursive prediction that tracks the evolution of each stream, using a Kalman filtering approach. The proposed approach combines spectral analysis operating at the level of the auditory periphery with a temporal analysis using Kalman tracking. To incorporate nonlinear relationships in the signal patterns, we employ an extended Kalman filter. This scheme is tested on sinusoidal patterns, or the two tone paradigm. The combined spectral and temporal analysis developed here is able to predict perceptual results of stream segregation by human listeners in a two tone paradigm."
1722703,13990,22021,Efficient code-based one-time signature from automorphism groups with syndrome compatibility,2012,"In this paper we propose a new one-time signature algorithm based on coding theory. The algorithm uses properties of automorphism group of certain codes to dramatically decrease the size of the public key of the scheme. By considering the action of cyclic shifts or the action of the group PSL 2 (p) we obtain public keys of less than 18 kilobits for a signature of 7 kilobits. Overall the scheme we propose is perfectly fitted to be used with Merkle tree and proposes a very good trade-off between size of key and size of signatures compared to other code-based signature schemes, with multi-time signatures of size 28kb."
1464618,13990,208,Android Smartphone Third Party Advertising Library Data Leak Analysis,2014,Android has many security flaws that are being exploited by malicious developers. Common malware includes many different kinds of behaviors; from complicated root exploits -- to simple private data leakage via explicit permissions. The security features that have been put in place by the Android developers have proven to be insufficient and incapable of preventing malware from proliferating through official and unofficial repositories. Private data leakage has become a popular topic because of the sheer number of applications that request the various permissions to access mobile device's private data and an influx of general privacy concerns amongst the Android community.
923483,13990,208,Energy-Balanced Matching and Sequence Dispatch of Robots to Events: Pairwise Exchanges and Sensor Assisted Robot Coordination,2013,"Given a set of events and a set of robots, the dispatch problem is to allocate one robot for each event to visit it. In a single round, each robot may be allowed to visit only one event (matching dispatch), or several events in a sequence (sequence dispatch problem). The distributed version of the problem is embedded into a sensor network field, where each event is discovered by a sensor and reported to a robot. Existing centralized and distributed solution based on stable marriage problem suffers from the presence of long robot paths. The other existing solution, based on k-means clustering and traveling salesman tour, suffers from the design goal of allocating the same number of events to each robot. We propose pair wise distance based matching (PDM) algorithm, to eliminate long matching edges by pair wise exchanges among two robot-event pairs to reduce overall path length. Our sequence dispatch (SQD) algorithm finds the closest robot for each free event, and, iteratively, selects closest event-robot pair while moving selected robot to the new position and updating other distances to reflect that new position. When event-robot distances are multiplied by robot resistance (inverse of the remaining energy), the corresponding energy-balanced variants are obtained. Our localized algorithm (MAD) is based on information mesh infrastructure for finding nearby robot, and local auctions in robot network to perhaps find a better one."
2184557,13990,20348,Simbeeotic: a simulation-emulation platform for large scale micro-aerial swarms,2012,"Micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) swarms are an emerging class of mobile sensing systems. Designing the next generation of such swarms requires the ability to rapidly test algorithms, sensors, and support infrastructure at scale. Simulation is useful in the early stages of such large-scale system design, when hardware is unavailable or deployment at scale is impractical. To faithfully represent the problem domain, an MAV swarm simulator must be able to model all key aspects of the system:  actuation, sensing, and communication . Further, it is important to be able to quickly test swarm behavior using different control algorithms in a varied set of environments, and with a variety of sensors.   We demonstrate Simbeeotic, a simulation framework that is capable of modeling large-scale MAV swarms. Simbeeotic enables algorithm development and rapid prototyping through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experimentation. We demonstrate Simbeeotic running simulated applications and videos demonstrating hybrid experiments with simulated MAVs as well as helicopters flying in our testbed that show the power and versatility required to assist next generation swarm design."
1379386,13990,208,Setup and Configuration of MapReduce in a Cloud Environment,2014,"In this paper we will look at how we went about setting up our clusters. We will work on implementing Apache's open-source software, Hadoop, onto virtual machines in our TCloud Cluster. We will also be implementing Apache's Hadoop in our Net Cloud clusters. Both of these clusters will be running on the open-source software named Eucalyptus. We will discuss installation and configuration of the open-source Eucalyptus cloud onto our Net Cloud cluster. We will also discuss the writing of scripts for both the TCloud Cluster and the Net Cloud cluster, which will setup Hadoop in both the multi-node and single-node configurations. Finally, we will touch on the documentation that we worked on, and we will explain why we did it. Once we have finished presenting what were able to accomplish in both of the clusters available for use, we will discuss our desires for future works, with the paper's conclusion following immediately after."
510915,13990,293,On reducing the impact of interdomain route changes,2011,"Interdomain route changes are frequent and they can have negative impact on a network's operation: during route convergence, packets get delayed and dropped; after route convergence, changes in the egress point for reaching a destination can alter the network's intradomain traffic patterns and trigger new traffic-engineering. In this paper, we look into reducing the impact of interdomain route changes on the network's operation. First, we investigate a route decision process which avoids the selection of routes that cause egress point changes. However, this decision process does not consider the potential benefit of selecting a more preferred route even if it causes an egress point change. Then, we propose a system which only avoids route changes causing recurring intradomain traffic shifts by processing the route changes history and by selectively modifying route attributes which affect the route decision process. We evaluate both approaches using data from a major European ISP. The modified route decision process avoids 89% of the observed intradomain traffic shifts caused by interdomain route changes, whereas route attribute modifications reduce the number of traffic shifts on average by 25%, and as much as 50%."
1434791,13990,208,Reality Mining: Digging the Impact of Friendship and Location on Crowd Behavior,2013,"Finding basic laws that govern human crowd behavior is a subject that deserves to study. Crowd behavior is a natural instinct for human, which directly impacts how we form opinions and make decisions. Moreover, it is common that people change their behavior in a group. In pervasive computing research, substantial work has been directed towards discovering human movement patterns based on wireless networks. This research has, however, mainly been focused on movements of individuals. Mobile phones offer on-body tracking and they are already deployed on a large scale, allowing the characterization of user behavior through the information related to individual movements. In this paper, we observe and analyze the impact of friendship and location attributes on crowd behavior, using location-based wireless mobility information. These preliminary studies will be a good cornerstone for a crowd behavior prediction."
957366,13990,208,Fast verification of an ID-based signature scheme for broadcast authentication inwireless sensor networks,2012,"Broadcast authentication is a fundamental security ser- vice in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Recently, sev- eral public-key-based schemes have been proposed to achieve immediate broadcast authentication with signifi- cantly improved security strength. While the public-key- based schemes obviate the security vulnerability inherent to symmetric-key-based μTESLA-like schemes, their signature verification is time-consuming. Thus, speeding up signa- ture verification is a problem of considerable practical im- portance, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents an accelerated verification of vBNN- IBS, a pairing-free identity-based signature with reduced signature size. A quantitative analysis demonstrates that the accelerated vBNN-IBS reduces 38.62% energy consump- tion in a 4×4 grid-basedWSN and runs 66%faster than the traditional signature verification method. It also allows the total energy consumption to be reduced by up to 23.25% and 25.14% compared to, respectively, IMBAS [1] and EIBAS [13] ID-based broadcast authentication schemes."
1003476,13990,208,WiFiScout: A Crowdsensing WiFi Advisory System with Gamification-Based Incentive,2014,"As mobile crowd sensing techniques are steering many smart-city applications, an incentive scheme that motivates the crowd to actively participate becomes a key to the success of such city-scale applications. This paper presents a crowd sensing WiFi advisory system called WiFiScout, which helps smartphone users to find good quality WiFi hotspots. The quality information is defined in terms of user experience and hence the system requires users to contribute information of their experience with WiFi hotspots. To motivate people to contribute such information, we design and implement a gamification-based incentive scheme in WiFiScout. It allows a user to conquer WiFi territories by becoming the top contributor for WiFi hotspots at different locations. The contribution is based on the diversity and amount of data a user submits, for which he will be rewarded accordingly. WiFiScout has been implemented on Android and it facilitates the collection of city-wide WiFi advisory information provided by real users according to their actual experience."
2024881,13990,22021,An additive exponential noise channel with a transmission deadline,2011,"We derive the maximum mutual information for an additive exponential noise (AEN) channel with a peak input constraint. We find that the optimizing input density is mixed (with singularities) similar to previous results for AEN channels with a mean input constraint. Likewise, the maximum mutual information takes a similar form, though obviously the maximum for the peak constraint is smaller than for the corresponding mean-constrained channel. This model is inspired by multiple biological phenomena and processes which can be abstracted as follows: inscribed matter is sent by an emitter, moves through a medium, and arrives eventually at its destination receptor. The inscribed matter can convey information in a variety of ways such as the number of signaling quanta - molecules, macromolecular complexes, organelles, cells and tissues - that are emitted as well as the detailed pattern of their release. However, rather than focus on a general class of emitter-receptor systems or a particular exemplar of biomedical importance, our ultimate goal is to provide bounds on the potential efficacy of timed-release signaling for any system which emits identical signaling quanta. That is, we seek to apply one of the most potent aspects of information theory to biological signaling - mechanism blindness - in the hopes of gaining insights applicable to diverse systems that span a wide range of spatiotemporal scales."

794751,13990,208,Mobile-Beacon Assisted Sensor Localization with Dynamic Beacon Mobility Scheduling,2011,"In mobile-beacon assisted sensor localization, beacon mobility scheduling aims to determine the best beacon trajectory so that each sensor receives sufficient beacon signals with minimum delay. We propose a novel DeteRministic bEAcon Mobility Scheduling (DREAMS) algorithm, without requiring any prior knowledge of the sensory field. In this algorithm, beacon trajectory is defined as the track of depth-first traversal (DFT) of the network graph, thus deterministic. The mobile beacon performs DFT under the instruction of nearby sensors on the fly. It moves from sensor to sensor in an intelligent heuristic manner according to RSS (Received Signal Strength)-based distance measurements. We prove that DREAMS guarantees full localization (every sensor is localized) when the measurements are noise-free. Then we suggest to apply node elimination and topology control (Local Minimum Spanning Tree) to shorten beacon tour and reduce delay. Through simulation we show that DREAMS guarantees full localization even with noisy distance measurements. We evaluate its performance on localization delay and communication overhead in comparison with a previously proposed static path based scheduling method."
1266689,13990,208,Collaborative assessment of functional reliability in wireless networks,2012,"Nodes that are part of a multihop wireless network, typically deployed in mission critical settings, are expected to perform specific functions. Establishing a notion of reliability of the nodes with respect to each function (referred to as functional reliability or FR) is essential for efficient operations and management of the network. This is typically assessed based on evidence collected by nodes with regards to other nodes in the network. However, such evidence is often affected by factors such as channel induced effects and interference. In multihop contexts, unreliable intermediary relays may also influence evidence. We design a framework for collaborative assessment of the FR of nodes, with respect to different types of functions; our framework accounts for the above factors that influence evidence collection. Each node (say Chloe) in the network derives the FR of other nodes (say Jack) based on two types of evidence: (i) direct evidence, based on her direct transactions with each such node and (ii) indirect evidence, based on feedback received regarding Jack from others. Our framework is generic and is applicable in a variety of contexts. We also design a module that drastically reduces the overhead incurred in the propagation of indirect evidence at the expense of slightly increased uncertainty in the assessed FR values. We implement our framework on an indoor/outdoor wireless testbed. We show that with our framework, each node is able to determine the FR for every other node in the network with high accuracy. Our indirect evidence propagation module decreases the overhead by 37% compared to a simple flooding based evidence propagation, while the accuracy of the FR computations is decreased only by 8%. Finally, we examine the effect of different routing protocols on the accuracy of the assessed values."
1393764,13990,208,IDEA1: A Validated System C-Based Simulator for Wireless Sensor Networks,2011,"This paper presents IDEA1, a validated SystemC-based simulator for WSNs. It allows the system-level performance evaluation (e.g., packet transmission and energy consumption) with elaborate models of sensor nodes. IDEA1 uses a clock-based synchronization mechanism to support simulations with cycle accurate communication and approximate time computation. Its accuracy has been validated by a testbed of 9 nodes. The average deviation between the IDEA1 simulations and experimental measurements is 5.9%. The performances of IDEA1 have also been compared with NS-2, one of the most widely used simulators in WSN research. To provide a similar result (deviation less than 5%) at the same abstraction level, the simulation of IDEA1 is 2 times faster than NS-2. Moreover, with the hardware and software co-simulation feature, IDEA1 provides more detailed modeling of sensor nodes than NS-2."
1331018,13990,208,How Environmental Factors Impact Outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks: A Case Study,2013,"How do the characteristics of the surrounding environment affect the ability of the nodes of a wireless sensor network (WSN) to communicate? Partial answers to this question can be found in the literature, but always with a focus on the short-term, small-scale behavior of individual links, as this directly informs the design of WSN protocols. In this paper, we are instead concerned with the large scale behavior of the overall network, observed over a longer time scale, as our primary interest is to support the deployment of WSNs by characterizing the impact of the target environment. Motivated by a real-world wildlife monitoring application, we report about experimental campaigns in three outdoor environments characterized by varying degrees of vegetation. Experiments are repeated in summer and winter, to account for seasonal variations, and span multiple days, allowing us to assess variations induced by the succession of day and night. Our experiments focus primarily on characterizing the impact of the environment on the physical layer, but we also investigate how this is mirrored at higher layers. We analyze the experimental data along multiple dimensions, yielding quantitative answers to the aforementioned question, and eliciting trends and findings previously not reported in the literature. We argue that this type of study may inspire new methods to better estimate the performance of a WSN in its target deployment environment."
1431399,13990,208,"OFBGP: A Scalable, Highly Available BGP Architecture for SDN",2014,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN), enabled by OpenFlow, represents a paradigm shift from traditional network to the future Internet. Compared with traditional networks, its controllers and network applications have higher requirements on the availability and scalability. This paper proposes OFBGP, a new scalable, highly available architecture of BGP totally based on distributed design, without any centralized component. OFBGP is an application of SDN controller. In the design of OFBGP, BGP functionalities are divided according to their characteristics and requirements into two modules: BGP Protocol and BGP Decision. By doing so, the application can easily scale out when the number of BGP neighbors increases, and the process of BGP routing decisions can be parallelized. The paper also presents a new solution to implement BGP NSR through snapshots and backup event flow so that from a historical snapshot, replaying real-time backup event flow can rebuild the state that has happened behind at any moment. When a fault occurs, we can easily restore a state to ensure BGP neighbors do not perceive failure. We have also built a prototype to demonstrate our architecture. After the test of the performance of some core modules, the result shows that our new architecture can help improve the availability and scalability of BGP."
860936,13990,208,Throughput-Optimal Robotic Message Ferrying for Wireless Networks Using Backpressure Control,2014,"We consider the problem of controlling the motion of a set of robots to ferry messages between a given set of statically-placed nodes. The design and analysis of an arrivalrate unaware throughput-optimal policy for this problem is challenging because of the coupling between position and link rate. We propose a fine-grained backpressure message ferrying algorithm (FBMF) for joint motion and transmission control of robots. Unlike traditional backpressure settings, because the controlled motion of the relay nodes changes the channel rates, it turns out that the conventional approach to prove throughput optimality does not work in this problem setting. We prove for the simplest setting (single-flow, single-robot, constant arrival) that this policy indeed achieves throughput optimality. The analysis reveals that under feasible traffic, even when queues are highly over-loaded, the change in the total queue size can be positive over a time step, nevertheless the system exhibits a limit-cycle behavior and stability holds because the change in the total queue size is negative over the cycle for sufficiently large queues. We pose the design and analysis of a throughput optimal policy for the general case as a challenging open problem for network theory."

Protocols for many services including data collection, localization, topology control and security in wireless sensor networks include mobile robots. Using a single robot limits the scalability and performance and multiple robots are used as a result. When multiple robots are deployed, it is desirable to have the robots connected to provide improved services. However, coordinating the robots optimally to achieve connectivity among them is not trivial. We use computational geometry techniques to achieve connectivity. We use the concept of Frechet distance between curves to synchronize the robots for connectivity. We extend the idea of Frechet distance to multiple curves where each curve is the path of a robot. We analyze the proposed idea theoretically and show that the theory can not be applied directly due to limitations on robot speed and speed changes. Therefore, we propose a practical approach where maximum robot speed is bounded and speed changes is limited. Simulations show that the connectivity among the robots is maintained when the robots follow the movement pattern based on the Frechet distance between the paths of consecutive robots."
1666514,13990,208,Fast identification of mobile RFID tags,2012,"We consider the problem of efficient and fast identification of mobile tags in RFID networks. So far only a few works have addressed identification of mobile tags, and in very specific scenarios (i.e., tags placed on a moving conveyor). In this paper we address more general scenarios, involving tags that are free to move and may stay in the reader range for very short time (e.g., a few seconds), making their identification a real challenge for the reader. We propose a protocol, called PrIME (for Priority-based tag Identification in Mobile Environments), that is based on a probabilistic model and performs continuous reading cycles during which tags may enter and leave the system at any time. Through extensive ns2-based simulations we show that PrIME is very efficient, as it is able to identify 98–99% of mobile tags and to reduce the identification delay drastically with respect to other protocols."
1532548,13990,208,Finding Nemo: Finding Your Lost Child in Crowds via Mobile Crowd Sensing,2014,"Mobile Crowd Sourcing/Sensing (MCS), as a new paradigm for participatory sensing, is suitable for large-scale hard tasks that are costly, or infeasible with conventional methods. Utilizing the ubiquitousness of crowds of sensor-rich smartphones, MCS has enormous potential to truly unleash the power of collaborative locating and searching at a societal scale. In this paper, we target the application of finding and locating the lost child in crowds via MCS. Conventional localization approaches require fixed anchor networks or fingerprinting points as references. It is not effective for locating the child in open and uncontrolled areas. We propose MCS-based collaborative localization via nearby opportunistically connected participators. To obtain sufficient measurements, we utilize one-hop and multi-hop assistants to reach more participators. Semidefinite Programming (SDP) based global optimization approaches are proposed to leverage all the location and ranging measurements in a best-effort way. We conduct extensive experiments and simulations in various scenarios. Compared with other classic algorithms, our proposed approach achieves significant accuracy improvement and could locate the unlocalizable child."
899195,13990,208,Wi-Fi Fingerprint Based Indoor Localization without Indoor Space Measurement,2013,"Numerous indoor localization techniques have been proposed recently to meet the intensive demand for location-based service. Fingerprint-based approach is one of most popular and inexpensive solution. In terms of constructing the fingerprint database, there have to be a synchronized measurement for both indoor space(eg by labor-intensive site-survey or sensor-based crowd sensing) and fingerprint space, by this means the fingerprints database is established. It is the indoor space measurement hinders the usability of fingerprint-based localization system. In this work, we propose a sensor-free crowds ensing indoor localization scheme, protocol. The main contribution of our protocol is that we don't need indoor space measurement. Floor plan and RSS samples temporal sequence is the only requirement. The core of our method is a graph matching based manifold alignment process, which automatically finds the best correspondence between floor plan and wireless fingerprint transition structure. With no more need of indoor space measurement, the system deployment complexity and cost are significantly reduced. We implement our protocol at AP-end and deploy it in a 2000m 2  office environment. The evaluation has shown that our protocol can handle complex environment mapping and achieve high localization & tracking accuracy."
1149034,13990,208,Adaptive Sampling and Duty Cycling for Smartphone Accelerometer,2013,"Mobile device based sensing provides a vast variety of user contextual information. To continuously acquire, classify and reason any context through built-in sensors cause mobile device batteries to deplete rapidly. Therefore, an urgent need has arisen to apply power saving approaches at the low level sensor operations while inferring user relevant context. In this paper, an adaptive sensing strategy is proposed to fill the mentioned deficiency within the realm of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The strategy aims at inferring any user relevant postural activities through smartphone accelerometer by providing two intuitive power saving methods, which assign adaptive pairs of sampling frequencies and duty cycles during sensor operations. The proposed methods show from 20% up to 50% efficiency enhancement in power consumption caused by the accelerometer with respect to overall 15% accuracy decrease in context inference depending on the degree of user activity dynamics."
819998,13990,208,Image Separation Based on Augmented Lagrange Multiplier Using Rank Prior,2014,"Natural or synthetic image can be decomposed into pattern images with regular or near regular objects. Effective separation makes possible to track object or recognize and recover hidden area from occlusion, or estimate the background from video. To separate high dimensional data with low rank matrix and sparse matrix, Robust Principal Component Analysis, RPCA is commonly used since it is stronger for gross error or outliers than PCA. There are many algorithms for convex optimization problem formulated by RPCA. Among them the Augmented Lagrange Multiplier Method are very fast and converge to exact optimal solution. This paper focuses on the regularization parameter dependent on input signal complexity, such as rank, instead of previous work has fixed value dependent on the size of row. The rank of input image helps to predict the weight of low rank matrix and sparse matrix. A number of experimental results prove that our regularization parameter is robust on various situations."
1384451,13990,208,A Range-Free Multiple Target Localization Algorithm Using Compressive Sensing Theory in Wireless Sensor Networks,2014,"Considering the incompleteness of localization information in wireless sensor networks, the sensor network monitoring region was divided into a plurality of small grids. Sensors and targets are randomly dropped in the grids. Defining the targets position information as a sparse vector, a range-free multiple target localization algorithm using compressive sensing theory (MTLCS) was proposed. Only targets number sensed by sensor nodes is needed in the algorithm. It doesn't depend on extra hardware measurements. MTLCS can provide the targets position with sparse detected information. The number of targets detected by sensor nodes was expressed as the product of measurement matrix, sparse matrix and sparse vector in compressive sensing theory. Targets are localized with the sparse signal reconstruction. In order to explore MTLCS performance, BP and OMP are applied to recover targets localization. In case of grid number N=20 × 20, simulation is done with different measurement noise, sensing radius, targets number and sensor numbers. In case of 0.6ale;r/nale;0.8, simulation results show that MTLCS has the localization error smaller than 30% without physical distance measurement. MTLCS can satisfy the requirements of target localization in wireless sensor network in the case of incomplete information."
907472,13990,208,Minimum Power Broadcast: Fast Variants of Greedy Approximations,2014,"We study the problem of assigning transmission power to the nodes of ad hoc wireless networks to minimize power consumption while ensuring that the given source reaches all the nodes in the network (unidirectional links allowed for broadcast). In the most general cost model, the best published approximation ratio is achieved by the greedy spider algorithm (Calinescu et al., ESA 2003). We present a variant of this algorithm with running time big-Oh of n to power 3 (n is the number of nodes), and the same approximation ratio. In the restricted Euclidean two-dimensional cost model, where the power requirement to transmit from node u to node v is the Euclidean distance between the location of u and the location v, raised to a fixed power that dependends on the wireless environment, the best known approximation ratio is achieved by the relative greedy algorithm (Caragiannis et al., ICALP 2007). We present a variant of this algorithm with running time big-Oh of n times m (m is the number of edges in the input graph), and the same approximation ratio. The new variants make use of advanced data structures and/or simple amortized analysis, improving naive variants by a factor of n. This improvement allows us to apply these algorithms to large instances (1000-2000 nodes). Our experimental results show that the best output achievable within 100 seconds improves the solution based on minimum spanning tree by an average of up to 15%, and comes within 25% of optimum, in average, on the instances where we can compute the optimum (based on an integer program). The improvement is circa 50% larger compared to what one would get applying existing fast heuristics."
2570997,13990,369,Redundant Residue Number System Based Multicarrier DS-CDMA for Dynamic Multiple-Access in Cognitive Radios,2011,"Redundant residue number system (RRNS)-based multicarrier DS-CDMA (MC/DS-CDMA) is proposed for dynamic multiple-access (DMA) in cognitive radios (CRs). The proposed RRNS-based MC/DS-CDMA DMA has the merits of low-complexity for implementation, high-flexibility for reconfiguration and spectrum handoff, robustness to spectrum varying, and fault-tolerance to errors. Specifically, in our RRNS-based MC/DS-CDMA DMA system, RRNS-based orthogonal modulation aided by MC/DS-CDMA is employed for information transmission. At the receiver, signals are detected subcarrier-by-subcarrier independently based on suboptimum MMSE interference cancellation (SMMSE-IC). In performance study, we model the arrival process of primary users (PUs) in primary radios (PRs) as a Poisson process. Both the bit error rate (BER) performance and throughput performance are investigated. Our studies and performance results show that the RRNS-based MC/DS-CDMA constitutes one of the highly promising DMA schemes for application in CRs. It is capable of achieving a substantial throughput with required quality for the CR systems, while without degrading the quality-of-services (QoS) of the PR systems."

1611975,13990,208,Codo: confidential data storage for wireless sensor networks,2012,"Many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are used to collect and process confidential information. Confidentiality must be ensured at all times and, for example, solutions for confidential communication, processing or storage are required. To date, the research community has addressed mainly the issue of confidential communication. Efficient solutions for cryptographically secured communication and associated key exchange in WSNs exist. Many WSN applications, however, rely heavily on available on-node storage space and therefore it is essential to ensure the confidentiality of stored data as well. In this paper we present Codo, a confidential data storage solution which balances platform, performance and security requirements. We implement Codo for the Contiki WSN operating system and evaluate its performance."
709657,13990,208,Modeling the Expected Data Collection Time for Vehicular Networks Using Random Walks on a Torus,2014,"We are interested in modeling the total expected data collection time for a set of cars (or other mobile nodes) to aggregate the information that they are each carrying to a single vehicle. Data collection processes between cars -- or other mobile nodes -- can be modeled as random walks of particles on a graph, and in this model, data is transferred between data-possessing cars once they encounter each other on the same node of the graph. We analyze this process in the special case in which this graph is a square grid torus graph. Recursion occurs in the system because once an encounter between multiple cars that possess data occurs, the system becomes analogous to simpler systems with the same graph and with fewer cars that possess data. We make approximations for the total data collection time using this recursive property."
1344139,13990,208,Understanding Multiple Features with Hypercube for Distinguishing Uncertain Objects in Mobile Crowdsensing,2014,"Uncertain data are inherent in mobile crowd sensing applications, and the objects that they correspond to are usually vaguely specified. In order to improve performance, we often increase the number of features. However, the more features are used, the more redundancy and cost are involved correspondingly. Therefore, the number of features we selected for a specified application is a tradeoffs between the accuracy and the cost. In this paper, we model such tradeoffs between accuracy and cost as an optimization problem. Moreover, for investigating this problem, we propose to model the sensing with multiple features under a hypercube structure. In our scheme, each feature of uncertain objects is represented as a component of the vertex's coordinate in hypercube. At the same time, we prefer to define the edges between vertices with relative entropy rather than Euclidean distance. Because the former one could accurately measures the difference between two probability distributions of data. We evaluate our proposed schemes with real data of a crowd sensing recognition case, which are collected by smartphones with sensors."
1092351,13990,208,Guaranteeing Stability and Delay in Dynamic Networks Based on Infinite Games,2014,"We study stability and delay in dynamic networks under adversarial conditions. Adversarial conditions are mandatory in establishing deterministic performance guarantees in networks. Under this framework, we concentrate on the general stability region for a network, i.e. without specifying the routing algorithm. This is in contrast to related work for adversarial network conditions, where usually the backpressure routing algorithm is considered. Our work consists of four novel contributions: (1) We present a novel analysis model which is based on the theory of infinite two-player games, (2) Using this approach, we can characterize the stability region of networks under adversarial conditions for arbitrary routing schemes, (3) We determine conditions under which a delay bound for packet forwarding under adversarial conditions exists, (4) We provide a backtracking algorithm which determines in a model-checking fashion network stability. The backtracking algorithm is furthermore shown to reduce the computational effort significantly for practical scenarios."
1711679,13990,208,A Theoretical Analysis of Path Loss Based Activity Recognition,2014,"Body area networks are used extensively in the medical field and elderly care. These networks perform a collection of roles including monitoring an individual's activities, through a process known as activity recognition. Current approaches to activity recognition require specialized hardware for advanced sensors which puts stress on battery life. We show that it is theoretically possible to distinguish between different human activities/postures by using radio signal propagation only and provide strategies for doing this. This is immensely beneficial to the field of sensor networks for two reasons: 1) It removes the need for more energy intensive components thus reducing strain on limited power resources and thus 2) reduces form factor for sensor network nodes. We show that activity recognition can be done using only radio signals at low transmit power levels with good accuracy. Lower power consumption and reduced form factor are desirable features for body networks and have been identified as being essential for wide adoption of body networks."
1018658,13990,208,Distributed Hole Detection Algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks,2014,"We present two novel distributed algorithms for hole detection in a wireless sensor network (WSN) based on the distributed Delaunay triangulation of the underlying communication graph. The first, which we refer to as the distance-vector hole determination (DVHD) algorithm, is based on traditional distance vector routing for multi-hop networks and shortest path lengths between node pairs. The second, which we refer to as the Gaussian curvature-based hole determination (GCHD) algorithm, applies the Gauss-Bonnet theorem on the Delaunay graph to calculate the number of holes based on the graph's Gaussian curvature. We present a detailed comparative performance analysis of both methods based on simulations, showing that while DVHD is conceptually simpler, the GCHD algorithm shows better performance with respect to run-time and message count per node."
2166351,13990,208,Optimizations for route discovery in asynchronous duty-cycling wireless networks,2012,"The use of asynchronous duty cycling at the MAC layer affords substantial energy savings in wireless networks. This technique is widely used in sensor networks and other types of wireless networks such as ad hoc networks. With asynchronous duty cycling, each node switches alternately between sleeping and active states; each node waking up asynchronously reduces network contention and wireless collisions caused by nodes waking up simultaneously, but also can have undesirable effects on higher layer protocols. In this paper, we study the problem of on-demand route discovery in asynchronous duty-cycling wireless networks and present four optimizations for such route discovery: Delayed Selection, Duty-Cycled Selection, Reply Updating, and Adaptive Backoff. Through detailed ns-2 simulations, we show that, without these optimizations, the routes discovered in asynchronous duty-cycling networks can be over 50% longer than the theoretical shortest routes and can have an ETX 90% larger than the ETX of the optimal routes. With only simple changes made at the MAC or network layers, our optimizations enabled nodes to substantially improve discovered routes, finding routes that were only 0.2% longer than the theoretical shortest routes or routes with an ETX only 9% larger than the ETX of the theoretical optimal-ETX routes, while also reducing route discovery latency and node energy consumption."
1763002,13990,208,WiFu: A composable toolkit for experimental wireless transport protocols,2012,"Extensive research has been performed on improving TCP performance in multi-hop wireless networks, but there have been relatively few experimental evaluations of this work. To make it easier to conduct research in this area, we are releasing WiFu, an open-source toolkit for developing experimental wireless transport protocols. WiFu provides for user-space development of reliable transport and rate control algorithms, greatly simplifying the implementation effort required. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the WiFu toolkit, which decomposes transport protocols into smaller components that enable rapid, plug-and-play development of new variants. We present experiments to demonstrate that the performance of WiFu compares favorably to the Linux kernel for wireless networks. We illustrate the utility of WiFu by using it to conduct experiments with several wireless transport protocols, and show that the performance of some protocols differs significantly from previously reported results."
806722,13990,208,Secured Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol,2011,"This research aims to complement security vulnerability of Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol (FTSP), which is currently one of the most sophisticated approaches for time synchronization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). FTSP has advanced features like implicitly dynamic topology and high accuracy time, but its original design does not consider security issues. In order to defend against attacks from malicious nodes, we propose several techniques to reinforce the structure of FTSP. A reference node selecting mechanism is proposed to reduce the effect of multiple reference nodes, and four filters are proposed to defend against seqNum attack, global time attack, and node replication attack. Experiments of the above attacks are performed and the results show that all these attacks can be defended when sequence number blacklist filter and global time blacklist filter are adopted. Furthermore, fluctuation filter helps to reduce the data collection time from 10 sending cycles to 5 cycles when detecting global time attack."
1526858,13990,208,Flexibility of Routing Framework Architecture in IEEE 802.11s Mesh Networks,2011,"The fundamental challenges in wireless multihop networks design are the problems of routing and hidden stations. Defining mesh networking, IEEE 802.11s amendment addresses both issues. It includes a routing protocol and novel deterministic channel access method, called MCCA, complementing random access traditional in IEEE 802.11 networks. The routing framework architecture allows extending or even replacing the default routing protocol for specific niche application, but it is not flexible enough to take advantage of using both traditional random access and novel deterministic access, as we show in this paper. Proposed flexibility enhancements are illustrated to bring benefits for the network performance."
1126616,13990,208,Fine-Grained Landmark Based Greedy Geographic Routing with Guaranteed Delivery Under Uncertain Locations,2013,"This poster presents a hierarchical greedy geographic routing scheme in wireless networks, which performs greedy geographic routing with guaranteed delivery under uncertain locations on a landmark graph by leveraging a fine-grained connectivity-based planarization algorithm. This design neither depends on exact node locations, nor needs to store any global state information in each node. The algorithm works in a completely localized fashion, and the additional storage and computation complexity is extremely low.

1382008,13990,208,An Advanced Anti-Collision Algorithm Based on Inter-Tag Communication Mechanism in RFID-Sensor Network,2014,"In this paper, an advanced anti-collision algorithm in RFID-sensor network based on inter-tag communication mechanism is proposed to improve the performance of the system. By employing the Tag Communication Slot (TCS) and designing the relevant hardware, the tags can communicate with each other, transmit useful data to fewer tags and reduce the number of tags participating in the identification process. In this way, we can efficiently reduce the collision rate with the increase of tag number and improve the tag starvation problem in Dynamic Framed-Slotted ALOHA algorithm (DFSA). The simulation results show that the TCS algorithm can greatly improve the system stability and identification efficiency especially in the case of large tag number."

For a set of realistic parameters the paper will show that multi hopping with more than 50 relays will need more time than the overlay network and with respect of energy the usage of more than 6 relays is using more energy than the overlay network. The paper underlines the importance of the idle power value for such calculations.
1242640,13990,208,A Sensor Network Abstraction for Flexible Public Sensing Systems,2011,Public Sensing is a new paradigm for developing large-scale sensor networks at low cost by utilizing mobile phones that are already surrounding us in our everyday lives. In this paper we present a sensor network abstraction layer for creating flexible public sensing systems that can execute arbitrary queries. To this effect we develop several algorithms to select mobile nodes for executing a query. These algorithms allow a user to define a trade-off between quality and efficiency of query execution by choosing an appropriate algorithm. Our evaluations show that we can achieve a 99% increase in efficiency with the most efficient approaches and only about 10% decrease in result quality under worst conditions.

1167503,13990,22021,Reconsidering unique information: Towards a multivariate information decomposition,2014,"The information that two random variables $Y$, $Z$ contain about a third random variable $X$ can have aspects of shared information (contained in both $Y$ and $Z$), of complementary information (only available from $(Y,Z)$ together) and of unique information (contained exclusively in either $Y$ or $Z$). Here, we study measures $\widetilde{SI}$ of shared, $\widetilde{UI}$ unique and $\widetilde{CI}$ complementary information introduced by Bertschinger et al., which are motivated from a decision theoretic perspective. We find that in most cases the intuitive rule that more variables contain more information applies, with the exception that $\widetilde{SI}$ and $\widetilde{CI}$ information are not monotone in the target variable $X$. Additionally, we show that it is not possible to extend the bivariate information decomposition into $\widetilde{SI}$, $\widetilde{UI}$ and $\widetilde{CI}$ to a non-negative decomposition on the partial information lattice of Williams and Beer. Nevertheless, the quantities $\widetilde{UI}$, $\widetilde{SI}$ and $\widetilde{CI}$ have a well-defined interpretation, even in the multivariate setting."

Thosesequences have a very simple structure, i.e., their trace represen-tation has two trace monomial terms. In this paper, we presenta proof for this conjecture. The mathematical tools employedare the second-order multiplexing decimation-Hadamard trans-form, Stickelberger’s theorem, the Teichmuller character, and¨combinatorial techniques for enumerating the Hamming weightsof ternary numbers. As a by-product, we also prove that theLin conjectured ternary sequences are Hadamard equivalent toternary m-sequences. I.

1122312,13990,10228,Obtaining consistent good/bad plan set in the presence of faults,2013,"In a cooperative network, we need a mechanism that allows all correct processors to reach a common agreement. Hence, more and more attention has been drawn on the agreement related problems (Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem and Consensus problem). In previous results, the goal of BA and Consensus is obtaining a common value no matter this value is good or bad. To address this problem, Correia, Bessani and Verissimo proposed the Byzantine Generals with Alternative Plans (BGAP) protocol that requires the common value come from the good plan set. BGAP is a graceful and practical protocol. They also pointed out that the BA problem with alternative plans is unsolvable if correct processors have different good plans and bad plans. In this paper, we propose the Plan_Consensus Protocol (PCP) to ensure that all correct processors obtain a consistent good plan set and a consistent bad plan set in the network."
1573402,13990,20348,MARS: a muscle activity recognition system enabling self-configuring musculoskeletal sensor networks,2013,"Poor posture and incorrect muscle usage are a leading cause of many injuries in sports and fitness. For this reason, non- invasive, fine-grained sensing and monitoring of human motion and muscles is important for mitigating injury and improving fitness efficacy. Current sensing systems either de- pend on invasive techniques or unscalable approaches whose accuracy is highly dependent on body sensor placement. As a result these systems are not suitable for use in active sports or fitness training where sensing needs to be scalable, accurate and un-inhibitive to the activity being performed. We present MARS, a system that detects both body motion and individual muscle group activity during physical human activity by only using unobtrusive, non-invasive in- ertial sensors. MARS not only accurately senses and recreates human motion down to the muscles, but also allows for fast personalized system setup by determining the individual identities of the instrumented muscles, obtained with minimal system training. In a real world human study con- ducted to evaluate MARS, the system achieves greater than 95% accuracy in identifying muscle groups."
2007508,13990,22164,CHAINS: Competition and cooperation between fragmentary event predictors in a Model of Auditory Scene Analysis,2011,"This paper presents an algorithm called Chains for separating temporal patterns of events that are mixed together. The algorithm is motivated by the task the auditory system faces when it attempts to analyse an acoustic mixture to determine the sources that contribute to it, and in particular, sources that emit regular sequences. The task is complicated by the fact that a mixture can be interpreted in several ways. For example, a complex pattern may issue from a complex source; or, alternatively, it may arise from the interaction of many simple sources. The idea pursued here is that the brain attempts to account for an incoming sequence in terms of short, fragmentary sequences, called chains. Chains are built as the input arrives and, once built, are used to predict inputs. A group of chains can coalesce to form an organisation, in which the member chains alternately generate predictions. A chain fails upon making an incorrect prediction, and any organisation it belongs to collapses. Several incompatible organisations can exist in parallel. The Chains algorithm thus remains open to multiple interpretations of a sequence. Perceptual multistability, in which the perceptual experience of an ambiguous stimulus switches spontaneously from one interpretation to another, seems to require a similar flexibility of representation."
1844497,13990,23653,ESTHER: a portable sensor toolkit to collect and monitor total hip replacement patient data,2013,"Due to the increasing cost of medical care, hospitals are looking at post surgery patients' home as the primary place for recovery. Unfortunately, this paradigm shift involves difficulties for patients and physiotherapists to manage the expected outcomes. While patients face physical and emotional problems related to the new hip, clinical teams have limited resources to follow patients' health experiences during their recovery. Mobile technologies for home care provide opportunities to remotely support patients in their rehabilitation process. They are designed to become part of patients' daily activities, which requires a holistic understanding of the dynamics of post-surgery treatment. Therefore, it is foreseen that requirements to design home care technologies should address clinicians' needs related to the functional aspects as well as patients' experiences of home recovery. ESTHER (Experience Sampling for Total Hip Replacement) is a research and design toolkit developed to study Total Hip Replacement (THR) patients' experiences after surgery and to evaluate design interventions to support patients in the complexity of home recovery. The tool is based on the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to capture patients' self report on their recovery process. In an iterative approach the tool gradually added to patients' psychological reports physical activity using wireless sensor nodes. The first three iterations of ESTHER are described to illustrate the value of situated self-reports and the richness of combining both self-report and sensing techniques as a holistic approach to understand both behavioral and experiential aspects of home recovery. The experience in conducting situated design research has shown to be valuable in understanding the technical as well as social challenges and opportunities for the research and design community of home health technologies."

As a result, sensing and monitoring muscles, as well as human motion, is important. Toward this end, we present the Muscle Activity Recognition System (MARS) system. MARS utilizes a system of small inertial sensors to deduce body motion and muscle fatigue. In this demo we demonstrate how MARS' sensors, placed on the major muscles of the lower body (hamstrings, quadriceps, calves), are used for motion capture and muscle fatigue determination. The system uses an animated human body model to display the motion of the subject, and highlight using different colors, the fatigue status of the muscles in use."
1621446,13990,20348,Poster abstract: smartphone support for persons who stutter,2014,"Stuttering is a very complex speech disorder that affects around 0.7% of adults while around 5% of the population have stuttered at some point. A large percentage of the affected people tend to speak more fluently when their own speech is played back to their ear with some type of alteration. While this has been done with special devices, smartphones can be used for this purpose. We report on our initial experiences on building such an application and demonstrate problems with delay caused by the lack of real-time support for audio playback in the Android operating system. We also discuss ideas for future work to improve app support for people who stutter."
1395992,13990,339,Carving secure wi-fi zones with defensive jamming,2012,"With rampant deployment of wireless technologies such as WLAN, information leakage is increasingly becoming a threat for its serious adopters such as enterprises. Research on antidotes has been mainly focused on logical measures such as authentication protocols and secure channels, but an inside collaborator can readily circumvent such defenses and wirelessly divert the classified information to a conniver outside. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the problem that forges a walled wireless coverage, a secure Wi-Fi zone in particular. Inspired by the fact that jamming as an attack is inherently difficult to defeat, we turn the table and use it as a  defensive  weapon to fend off the covert illegal access from outside. To validate the proposed approach, we conduct extensive outdoor experiments with the IEEE 802.11g Wi-Fi adapters. The measurements show that the forged secure zones match well with the model prediction and that the defensive jamming approach can indeed be used to protect wireless networks against information leakage. Lastly, we propose the algorithms to configure defensive jammers in arbitrary geometry."
1239119,13990,208,Mobile barrier coverage for dynamic objects in wireless sensor networks,2012,"This paper studies mobile barrier coverage (MBC) surrounding dynamic objects. In the real world, several dynamic objects can benefit from MBC. For example, marching troop can detect any adversary intrusion without blind spot by MBC. However, conventional works only focused on barrier coverage for static objects, which fail when the objects start to move. Issues to address these dynamic-object scenarios, we propose the problem of mobile barrier coverage for dynamic objects. The most challenge is how to effectively maintain MBC when the motion of objects are unpredictable. We propose a fully distributed algorithm for mobile sensor nodes to cooperatively move and maintain the high-quality barrier coverage. The extensive simulations based on large-scale trace data demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed algorithm."
1591651,13990,208,Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Path Hiding for Participatory Sensing Applications,2011,"The presence of multimodal sensors on current mobile phones enables a broad range of novel mobile applications including, e.g., monitoring noise pollution or traffic and road conditions in urban environments. Data of unprecedented quantity and quality can be collected and reported by a possible user base of billions of mobile phone subscribers worldwide. The collection of detailed sensor and location data may however compromise user privacy. In this paper, we present a decentralized mechanism to preserve location privacy during the collection of sensor readings. As most sensor readings are geotagged, we propose to exchange them between users in physical proximity in order to jumble the paths followed by the users. We evaluate different strategies to exchange and report the sensor readings to the application using real-world GPS traces of mobile users. The results demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of our proposed scheme, which can obfuscate up to 100% of the visited locations in the best instances."
1546622,13990,208,Multipath Dissemination for Collaborative Mobile Internet Access,2014,"Multihoming has become increasingly common, especially in the mobile domain. This enables co-located devices to form networks on demand. These networks can then be used to share and extend Internet connectivity. As multiple heterogeneous links are available on each device, additional points of Internet access are exposed within the network, typically they are left unused. In this paper we propose and evaluate a technique which enables multipath communications to take advantage of these additional links, by doing so we increase bandwidth, resilience and therefore the quality of service and experience. This is achieved by disseminating multihomed information into the network, with the intention of building a complete topological view at each host. Consequently, this enables intelligent link selection per application, as well as facilitating multipath protocols to use any available network resource."
1819408,13990,208,Secure and Efficient Video Surveillance in Cloud Computing,2014,"Video Surveillance has been widely used in business establishments. Since digital cameras everlastingly collect the video data, the volume of sampled data is extensively large, which is hard to be stored and managed locally. Outsourcing surveillance video data to the cloud can achieve cost saving and flexibility, but also will incur potential privacy leakage. In this paper, we utilize the Compressed Sensing (CS) technique for sampling and compressing, to achieve secure and efficient video surveillance in cloud computing. Firstly, we identify the known-plaintext attack in such environment. That is, given sufficient information about the original signal and corresponding CS measurements, the attacker is likely to calculate the measurement matrix. Then, we propose a Dynamic Compressive Sensing(DCS) scheme to resist such an attack. Specifically, we use a dynamic measurement matrix that is changeable over time to prevent the attackers from gaining sufficient information to calculate the measurement matrix. Furthermore, we allow the cloud to help users decode the non-reference frames without leaking any information, to take full advantage of the powerful computing. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme effectively protects the security of the surveillance video, and provides a good recovery quality for users to conduct further analysis."
1223189,13990,208,Relative Localization of Sensors Based on their Responses to Moving Objects,2013,"Spatial relations between sensors placed for target detection can be inferred from the responses of individual sensors to target objects. Using this fact, we propose a sensor localization method to estimate the relative locations of sensors based on the responses of the sensors to moving objects. We let several objects with different sizes move along various paths one by one within the field of watch, where sensors are deployed. When two sensors concurrently detect each of the objects, we assume that the distance between the two sensors is equal to a given constant. Based on the distances between sensors estimated from sensors' responses to the objects, the relative locations of sensors are estimated by a technique of the cooperative localization. Through several simulation experiments, we find that the proposed algorithm yields surprisingly accurate estimate of the relative locations of sensors."

We identify an example of a three user DBC for which the proposed achievable rate region strictly enlarges that obtained by a natural extension of Marton's [1] rate region. As a step towards deriving the achievable rate region for the general three user DBC, we characterize and derive an achievable rate region for a new class - 3-to-1 DBC- of broadcast channels of which the aforementioned is an example."

The corresponding modified degree distributions have been derived for the low-complexity LT decoder. The complexity and performance comparison demonstrate that the decoding complexity can be reduced with negligible degradation in bit error rate performance.

The node centrality is an eigenvector centrality. This paper also proposes two route selection method using an eigenvector centrality. The disjoint rate of the proposed methods are 30% to twice larger than that of the conventional methods. Therefore, it is found that the eigenvector centrality is an effective metric to achieve the high reliability routes in the disjoint multipath routing."

1818535,13990,22021,On a fast decoding of multipoint codes from algebraic curves,2011,"Multipoint codes are a broad class of algebraic geometry codes derived from algebraic functions which have multiple poles on their defining curves. Thus, they are more general than one-point codes which are an important class of algebraic codes in the sense that they can be decoded efficiently by using the BMS algorithm. In this paper we present a fast decoding method of multipoint codes from algebraic curves. Since algebraic geometry codes from algebraic curves are essentially the same as multipoint codes, this means that almost all algebraic geometry codes can be decoded efficiently."
2418493,13990,20348,mPuff: automated detection of cigarette smoking puffs from respiration measurements,2012,"ABSTRACT Smoking has been conclusively proved to be the leading cause of mortality that accounts for one in five deaths in the United States. Extensive research is conducted on developing effective smoking cessation programs. Most smoking cessation programs achieve low success rate because they are unable to intervene at the right moment. Identification of high-risk situations that may lead an abstinent smoker to relapse involve discovering the associations among various contexts that precede a smoking session or a smoking lapse. In the absence of an automated method, detection of smoking events still relies on subject self-report that is prone to failure to report and involves subject burden. Automated detection of smoking events in the natural environment can revolutionize smoking research and lead to effective inter-vention. In this paper, we present mPuff a novel system to automatically detect smoking puffs from respiration measure-ments, using which a model can be developed to automatically detect entire smoking episodes in the field. We introduce several new features from respiration that can help classify individual respiration cycles into smoking puffs or non-puffs. We then propose supervised and semi-supervised support vector models to detect smoking puffs. We train our models on data collected from 10 daily smokers and find that smoking puffs can be detected with an accuracy of 91% within a smoking session. We then consider respiration measurements during confounding events such as stress, speaking, and walking, and show that our model can still identify smoking puffs with an accuracy of 86.7%. The smoking detector presented here opens the opportunity to develop effective interventions that can be delivered on a mobile phone when and where smoking urges may occur, thereby improving the abysmal low rate of success in smoking cessation."
1044189,13990,22164,Extremal edges: Evidence in natural images,2011,"In complex natural scenes, information about figure ground organization is obtained from a combination of global and local features. In this study, we searched for local features that predict figure-ground assignment in natural images. A large number of image patches were extracted from natural images along the boundary of perceptual objects and Principal Component (PC) Analysis was applied to these patches. Two sets of experiments were carried out. In the first (E1), only patches were included that did not contain any occlusion features (T-junctions) in the background. In the second (E2), both patches with and without occlusions in the background were included. As expected, the first principal component in both datasets is a step edge, and the second PC in E2 is a T-junction in the background. The next principal component (PC2 in E1 and PC3 in E2) in both datasets has uniform intensity on the background side, and a large contrast gradient on the figure side. This is the signature of an extremal edge [1]; the gradient is a local feature indicative of an object occluding a background. To test if these components are predictive of figure-ground segregation, statistical analyses of distributions obtained by the projection of patches on the respective PCs were performed. Both datasets, E1 and E2, show significant differences on Students t-test (p ≤ 10 −22 ) and the Bayesian t-test (JZSbƒ ≤ 10 −19 ) between figure and background distributions. We conclude that: (1) next to the T-junction the second strongest local feature in natural images predictive of figure ground organization is a luminance gradient of the figure side; (2) figure-side gradients are prevalent irrespective of the presence or absence of occlusion features."
1761962,13990,22164,Exploiting temporal coherence in speech for data-driven feature extraction,2011,"It is well known that speech sounds evolve at multiple timescales over the course of tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Such temporal modulations are crucial for speech perception and are believed to directly influence the underlying code for representing acoustic stimuli. The present work seeks to explicitly quantify this relationship using the principle of temporal coherence. Here we show that by constraining the outputs of model linear neurons to be highly correlated over timescales relevant to speech, we observe the emergence of neural response fields that are bandpass, localized, and reflective of the rich spectro-temporal structure present in speech. The emergent response fields also appear to share qualitative similarities those observed in auditory neurophysiology. Importantly, learning is accomplished using unlabeled speech data, and the emergent neural properties well-characterize the spectro-temporal statistics of the input. We analyze the characteristics and coverage of ensembles of learned response fields for a variety of timescales, and suggest uses of such a coherence learning framework for common speech tasks."

Rapid proliferation of mobile telephony in low income, rural and underserved populations in the absence of other information and communication technology media have prompted the interests of researchers in public health sector. Exploiting mobile communication has resulted in formulation of a dependable and effective socio-technical ecosystem for public health. Whereas, involving academic researchers and community partners to collaborate and develop social and computational models, Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach targets building communication, trust and capacity, with the final goal of increasing community participation in the research process. CBPR is a collaborative approach to research which equitably involves all partners in the research process for betterment of the targeted community. In this paper we present a conceptual and implementation architecture for conducting mHealth assisted community-based interventions. The framework allows CBPR partners to customize the system and design interventions around locale, technology, geographic, scale, and nonetheless social and cultural aspects. We also present the design of our planned intervention addressing prenatal monitoring of underserved populations in the Andean regions of Peru."
1852870,13990,22021,The universality and linearity of compression by substring enumeration,2011,"A new lossless data compression technique called compression by substring enumeration (CSE) has recently been introduced. Two conjectures have been stated in the original paper and they have not been proved there nor in subsequent papers on CSE. The first conjecture says that CSE is universal for Markovian sources, provided an appropriate predictor is devised. The second one says that CSE has a linear complexity both in time and in space. In this paper, we present an appropriate predictor and demonstrate that CSE indeed becomes universal for any order-k Markovian source. Finally, we prove that the compacted substring tree on which CSE's linear complexity depends effectively has linear size."
1048986,13990,22021,On optimal sensor collaboration topologies for linear coherent estimation,2014,"Abstract —In the context of distributed estimation we considerthe problem of sensor collaboration, which refers to the actof sharing measurements with neighboring sensors prior totransmission to a fusion center. While incorporating the cost ofsensor collaboration, we aim to ﬁnd optimal sparse collaborationtopologies subject to a certain information or energy constraint.To achieve this goal, we present a tractable optimization frame-work and propose efﬁcient methods to solve the formulatedsensor collaboration problems. The effectiveness of our approachis demonstrated by numerical examples. I. I NTRODUCTION In this paper, we study the problem of distributed estimation[1], where each sensor reports the local observation of thephenomenon of interest and transmits a processed message(after inter-sensor communication) to a fusion center (FC)that determines the global estimate. The act of inter-sensorcommunication is referred to as sensor collaboration, wheresensors are allowed to share their observations with a set ofneighboring nodes prior to transmission to the FC. Recently,there has been a growing interest in designing sensor col-laboration schemes, spurred by a signiﬁcant improvement ofestimation performance resulting from collaboration [1]–[3].In [1], the optimal collaboration strategy was studied inan orthogonal multiple access channel (MAC) setting with afully connected network, where all the sensors are allowed tocollaborate. For a coherent MAC, it was shown in [2] thateven a partially connected network can yield performanceclose to that of a fully connected network; examples ofpartially connected networks include nearest-neighbor andrandom geometric graphs. However, the work of [1], [2]assumed that there is no cost associated with collaboration,the collaboration topologies are ﬁxed and given in advance,and the only unknowns are the collaboration weights used tocombine sensor observations. In [3], the nonzero collaborationcost was taken into account and a greedy algorithm wasdeveloped for seeking the optimal collaboration topology inenergy constrained sensor networks. This work is an extensionof [3]. We present a tractable framework to solve the collab-oration problem with nonzero collaboration cost, and proposean efﬁcient solution.First, we describe collaboration through the collaborationmatrix, in which the nonzero entries characterize the collabo-ration topology and the values of these entries characterizethe collaboration weights. We introduce a formulation thatsimultaneously optimizes both the collaboration topology andthe collaboration weights. This is in contrast to [3], wherethe optimization was performed in a sequential manner. Thenew formulation results in more efﬁcient allocation of energyresources as evidenced by improved distortion performance innumerical simulations.Second, in addition to the energy constrained problemconsidered in [3] where the Fisher information was maximizedsubject to a total energy budget, we also study an informationconstrained problem where the energy cost is minimizedwith a constraint on the Fisher information. For the informa-tion constrained problem, we apply the alternating directionsmethod of multipliers (ADMM) [4] to ﬁnd its locally optimalsolutions. For the energy constrained problem, we exploit itsrelationship with the information constrained problem andpropose a bisection algorithm to solve it. Numerical resultsare provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposedmethods.II. S"

The algorithm was tailored to two coordinate systems, global and body relative, and two velocity changing criteria, constant and variable speed. Three species of animals were considered: fish, birds and bats. Overall, strong correlations were found between the data and the algorithm in two of the species with data indicating a bias toward a body-fixed coordinate system with variable speed maneuvering. Results also suggested future development of a fully three dimensional algorithm rather than the planar version considered here."
1720396,13990,22021,Design principles and specifications for neural-like computation under constraints on information preservation and energy costs as analyzed with statistical theory,2012,"Given enough physical constraints, the format of optimal computation may resolve into a rather small set of options, which we call design specifications. Our interest centers on computational problems that are so intensive, relative to the time and energy available, that they can be solved only in a probabilistic fashion. Here we consider just information and energy in one particular computational format, called neural-like (NL), and characterized as massively parallel, analog computation. Within this format, we consider only the design of a single NL element and the nature of its inputs. Importantly, we provide a specific mathematical format of a simple NL element. We consider this format to be minimal and generic and, therefore, extendable to structures composed of several NL compartments. Secondly, the information and energy constraints are linked, via Shannon's entropy, to classical results from mathematical statistics yielding design specifications that go beyond our initial description of a NL element and its inputs. Critically, for a NL element to preserve all of its relevant input-information at minimal energetic cost, it must transform its inputs so as to create and communicate a minimal sufficient statistic. Then, the assumptions associated with producing such a statistic become new design specifications for NL computing."
995095,13990,22021,On antidictionary coding based on compacted substring automaton,2013,"Lossless data compression via substring enumeration (CSE) has been proposed by Dube and Beaudoin in 2010. The CSE outputs its encoder called compacted substring automaton as a codeword, and an efficient representation of the automaton is also proposed. In this paper, we prove an isomorphism between compacted substring automaton and antidictionary automaton, which is an encoder of antidictionary coding. Then we propose a new static antidictionary coding which uses the representation of compacted substring automaton instead of antidictionary. Moreover, we prove an asymptotic optimality of the proposed coding for a stationary ergodic source."
2155318,13990,23653,Toward automated categorization of mobile health and fitness applications,2014,"In recent years, with the explosive adoption of smart phone devices, mobile health and fitness applications have been increasingly used by healthcare practitioners and the general public to manage electronic health records, chronic medical conditions, dietary references etc. Despite the rapid growth in the number of mobile and fitness applications on various platforms, very little work has been done to quantitatively and qualitatively assess these applications to guide users in the selection process. Automatic categorization of mobile health and fitness applications is the first step in this direction. In this paper, we report results from crawling 1,430 Android and 62,286 iOS apps in Nov. 2013. Among them, 1,399 apps were manually classified to one or multiple categories out of a total of 11 categories. Text mining tools were applied to the description section of the apps for keyword extraction, feature selection and automatic categorization. The classifiers we experimented with have comparable performance with Linear SVC achieving the highest precision, recall and f1 scores of 0.89, 0.79 and 0.88, respectively."
1930897,13990,23836,e-Science Infrastructure Integration Invariants to Enable HTC and HPC Interoperability Applications,2011,"During the past decade, significant international and broader interdisciplinary research is increasingly carried out by global collaborations that often share resources within a single production e-science infrastructure. More recently, increasing complexity of e-science applications embrace multiple physical models (i.e. multi-physics) and consider longer and more detailed simulation runs as well as a larger range of scales (i.e. multi-scale). This increase in complexity is creating a steadily growing demand for cross-infrastructure operations that take the advantage of multiple e-science infrastructures with a more variety of resource types. Since interoperable e-science infrastructures are still not seamlessly provided today we proposed in earlier work the Infrastructure Interoperability Reference Model (IIRM) that represents a trimmed down version of the Open Grid Service Architecture (OGSA) in terms of functionality and complexity, while on the other hand being more specifically useful for production and thus easier to implement. This contribution focuses on several important reference model invariants that are often neglected when infrastructure integration activities are being performed thus hindering seamless interoperability in many aspects. In order to indicate the relevance of our invariant definitions, we provide insights into two accompanying cross-infrastructure use cases of the bio-informatics and fusion science domain."
2473864,13990,22021,Relations between redundancy patterns of the Shannon code and wave diffraction patterns of partially disordered media,2012,"The average redundancy of the Shannon code, R n , as a function of the block length n, is known to exhibit two very different types of behavior, depending on the rationality or irrationality of certain parameters of the source: It either converges to 1/2 as n grows without bound, or it may have a non-vanishing, oscillatory, (quasi-) periodic pattern around the value 1/2 for all large n. In this paper, we make an attempt to shed some insight into this erratic behavior of R n , by drawing an analogy with the realm of physics of wave propagation, in particular, the elementary theory of scattering and diffraction. It turns out that there are two types of behavior of wave diffraction patterns formed by crystals, which are correspondingly analogous to the two types of patterns of R n . When the crystal is perfect, the diffraction intensity spectrum exhibits very sharp peaks, a.k.a. Bragg peaks, at wavelengths of full constructive interference. These wavelengths correspond to the frequencies of the harmonic waves of the oscillatory mode of R n . On the other hand, when the crystal is imperfect and there is a considerable degree of disorder in its structure, the Bragg peaks disappear, and the behavior of this mode is analogous to the one where R n  is convergent."

More specifically, we investigate the use of root-mean squared (RMS)-based multilead followed by a single-lead online delineation algorithm, which is based on a state-of-the-art offline single-lead delineator. The algorithmic transformations and software optimizations necessary to enable embedded ECG delineation notwithstanding the limited processing and storage resources of the target platform are described, and the performance of the resulting implementations are analyzed in terms of delineation accuracy, execution time, and memory usage. Interestingly, RMS-based multilead delineation is shown to perform equivalently to the best single-lead delineation for the 2-lead QT database (QTDB), within a fraction of a sample duration of the Common Standards for Electrocardiography (CSE) committee tolerances. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation of the energy consumption entailed by the considered algorithms is proposed, which allows very relevant insights into the dominant energy-draining functionalities and which suggests suitable design guidelines for long-lasting wearable ECG monitoring systems."
1641748,13990,65,IMU based single stride identification of humans,2013,"To facilitate human-robot interactions with the user, it is necessary for the robot to identify the interaction partner. We propose the use of a single wearable sensor worn at the center of the user's belt to record the gait when the interaction partner approaches the robot. Based on the data of a single gait cycle recorded with a single inertial measurement unit (IMU), we identify a person by his/her walking style. For identification, we first detect individual strides. We introduce a simple feature that characterizes the individual's asymmetry of gait and classify the individual using a Bayes classifier. To evaluate our approach, we collect motion data from 20 persons; the classification accuracy based on the proposed asymmetry-based feature reaches 99.3%. We further investigate the robustness of our approach against slight variations in the sensor placement, variations in speed, and walking straight versus walking on a curved route."

Specifically, we take the view that first responders need to harvest the unknown capabilities of sensors in an area affected by an emergency. We show how a first responder can estimate the number of sensors with a desired sensing capability in an efficient fashion. At the heart of our algorithm is a simple probabilistic counting strategy. Our theoretical predictions were confirmed both by simulation and by implementation on IRIS sensor motes. Our theoretical and experimental results show that the error percentage of the capability collection is very low."
1457708,13990,208,Distributed Duty Cycle Management (DDCM) for IEEE 802.15.4 Beacon-Enabled Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks,2011,"This paper proposes an extension to the current IEEE802.15.4 standard in which flexible mesh networking in the low power beacon mode is enabled through the use of a distributed duty cycle management (DDCM) strategy in conjunction with a distributed time beacon scheduling (DTBS) technique. The DTBS technique enables a beacon enabled coordinator to calculate its time schedule to transmit beacons, thus avoiding potential collisions, without the need of a central coordinator. The proposed DDCM strategy is able to re-configure, in an IEEE802.15.4 beacon-enabled wireless mesh sensor network, nodes' duty cycle based only on locally available network information. DDCM features the allocation, deallocation and reallocation of superframe slots as well as the prevention and resolution of slot conflicts within a mesh network in a distributed fashion. The feasibility of our proposal is demonstrated and evaluated through network simulations. The proposed DDCM algorithm shows low slot collision probability and better energy efficiency than current state-of-the-art approaches."
1593894,13990,208,Coding Opportunities from Similar Data in Wireless Cooperation Diversity Systems,2011,"In wireless communication, diversity can be exploited for improved robustness. For wireless sensor networks, cooperation diversity protects a transmission from a source to a destination node by having a relay node overhear and repeat the source's transmission. Additionally, the data readings of the source and the relay node can be similar. The relay's data can hence be interpreted as a distorted version of the source's data. We show how to use forward error correction techniques to employ these similarities to reduce errors in the source-relay transmission. Moreover, we propose a new protocol, Coded Cooperation with Similar Data (CCSD), to take advantage of similar data to improve the source-to-relay link of Coded Cooperation (CC). CCSD is a conservative extension of CC, i.e., if data of source and relay are not similar, CCSD behaves like CC. We evaluate the performance of CCSD by simulation under realistic, symbol-wise Rayleigh fading. A comparison with the established Selection Decode-and-Forward (SDF) cooperation protocol, CC, and direct transmission shows superiority of the new CCSD protocol, especially for situations with a bad source-to-relay channel, good relay-to-destination channel, and strong error correcting codes."

Due to noise, exact consensus is never reached. Hence, we propose fully distributed and local Kalman filters that filter only a subset of all system states while maintaining a filter quality close to a global Kalman filter. Feasibility is guaranteed by communicating measurements through the network, introducing time delays. The overall system stability is analyzed. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed distributed filters."

1591507,13990,22164,On the equivalence of Hebbian learning and the SVM formalism,2012,"We show that it is possible to relate the Support Vector Machine formalism to Hebbian Learning in the context of olfactory learning in the insect brain. Since neurons cannot have negative firing rates, two neurons and synaptic inhibition are required to encode a binary classification problem in a biologically realistic way. We show that the two neuron system with plausible Hebbian learning rules can be mapped to a large margin classifier. Two formalisms are analyzed: regular SVMs and the so-called inhibitory SVMs. The regularization term in regular SVMs brings the synaptic vectors of the two neurons close to each other, while the inhibitory SVM can bring them to 0 resembling the memory loss process in Hebbian learning. Based on the analogy to large margin classifiers we also predict the existence of a negative Hebbian leaning rule for negative reinforcement signals."

1183574,13990,22164,A network model of multiplicative attentional modulation,2012,"Gain modulation of neuronal firing rate has been shown to be important for a large number of computations in the brain including attentional selection. Several models can produce gain modulation. One of the features characterizing attentional modulation is that attentional input in the absence of visual input produces little if any change in the mean firing rate of excitatory neurons in early visual cortex. This has been difficult to understand in computational models of gain modulation. Here we expand a previous network model of multiplicative neuron responses [1] by separating excitatory and inhibitory neuron propulations while keeping the single-neuron models simple. We analyze attentional input and lateral inhibition patterns which best reproduce electrophysiological results. We find that attentional input to excitatory and inhibitory neurons is the same, and, surprisingly, the optimal lateral inhibition connectivity is not Gaussian but needs to have a heavier tail. Addtionally, our model predicts that there is a minimum size of the attentional spotlight above which attentional modulation is multiplicative; below this minimum it becomes additive."
1577375,13990,22021,Unfair coin tossing,2013,"An ideal coin tossing resource for two parties outputs the same random bit to both parties. We introduce the notion of an unfair coin tossing resource by relaxing both the fairness and the non-influenceability guarantees that an ideal coin toss would provide. The presence of this non-ideal behavior is necessary in order to understand what coin tossing protocols really achieve in the setting of two distrustful parties, since it is known that such an ideal coin tossing resource cannot be constructed whenever a majority of players is dishonest."
1249587,13990,9015,Accurate caloric expenditure of bicyclists using cellphones,2012,"Biking is one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly ways to control weight and commute. To precisely estimate caloric expenditure, bikers have to install a bike computer or use a smartphone connected to additional sensors such as heart rate monitors worn on their chest, or cadence sensors mounted on their bikes. However, these peripherals are still expensive and inconvenient for daily use. This work poses the following question:  is it possible to use just a smartphone to reliably estimate cycling activity?  We answer this question positively through a pocket sensing approach that can reliably measure cadence using the phone's on-board accelerometer with less than 2% error. Our method estimates caloric expenditure through a model that takes as inputs GPS traces, the USGS elevation service, and the detailed road database from OpenStreetMap. The overall caloric estimation error is 60% smaller than other smartphone-based approaches. Finally, the smartphone can aggressively duty-cycle its GPS receiver, reducing energy consumption by 57%, without any degradation in the accuracy of caloric expenditure estimates. This is possible because we can recover the bike's route, even with fewer GPS location samples, using map information from the USGS and OpenStreetMap databases."
1171548,13990,208,TAGER: Trust-Aware Georouting Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks,2011,"Security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is a major requirement especially when these networks are used in hostile environments. In this paper, we present an efficient Trust-Aware GEographical Routing (TAGER) protocol which expands the simple and scalable position-based routing protocol and utilizes a trust strategy to safeguard routing behaviors and reduce the possibility of selecting the misbehaving nodes as forwarding nodes in WSNs. The algorithm is based on Greedy and Face routing strategies which are restricted in the trusted subminimal ellipses fixed by three points. Herein trust is characterized by the neighbors' feedback suggestions which can be perceived and obtained from reactive acknowledgement. In proposed TAGER protocol scheme, the recommendations are parameterized as trust values, which are changed and updated repeatedly. If the node data forwarding is successful, its trust value would be improved; else its trust level would be decreased because misbehaving nodes have been used as forwarding nodes or forwarding is abnormal. Our simulation results show how our TAGER protocol alleviates the effect of malicious nodes, and improves the packets delivery rate in WSNs."
1742954,13990,208,Efficient Decentralized Context Sharing via Smart Aggregation,2014,"Sensing applications often require participants to share context information about the physical social, or network environment in which they operate. Building shared views of context requires exchanging sensed information, often via peer-to-peer links. In-network aggregation enables efficient distributed data collection, but the goal has been almost exclusively collect a single aggregate value at a single sink node. In contrast, we design and implement a simple protocol for exchanging context information in aggregate in a peer-to-peer fashion, where every node needs to acquire a shared view of the aggregate context. In our protocol, when a node receives new context information from a neighboring node, it aggregates the new information into its local view of the shared state of the world which it then subsequently shares with its neighbors. We demonstrate (both theoretically and empirically) the situations in which participants' raw context information is fully or partially recoverable by other participants from an aggregate and quantify the tradeoffs in communication overhead for the quality of shared context knowledge. Compared with non-aggregation communication for sharing context values among 100 nodes in a simulated network, we show an overhead savings of at least 78.0%, and an overhead savings of 66.0% with 99.8% average accuracy in a 54 node emulated network driven by real world data."
658120,13990,208,Incentive-Driven and Freshness-Aware Content Dissemination in Selfish Opportunistic Mobile Networks,2013,"Recently, the content-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) paradigm is gaining popularity in opportunistic mobile networks (OppNets) for its flexibility and adaptability. Since nodes in OppNets is controlled by humans, they often behave selfishly with an aim to maximize their own revenues without considering the performance of others. Therefore, stimulating nodes in OppNets to collect, store, and share content efficiently is one of the key challenges under this scheme. Meanwhile, guaranteeing the freshness of content is also a big problem for content dissemination in OppNets. In this paper, in order to solve these problems, we propose an incentive-driven and freshness-aware pub/sub content dissemination scheme, called ConDis (Content Dissemination), for selfish OppNets. In ConDis, the Tit-For-Tat (TFT) scheme is employed to deal with selfish behaviors of nodes in OppNets. ConDis also implements a novel content exchange protocol when nodes are in contact. Specifically, during each contact, the exchange order is determined by the content utility, which is calculated by the direct subscribed value and the indirect subscribed value, and the objective of nodes is to maximize the utility of the content inventory stored in their buffer. Extensive realistic trace-driven simulation results show that ConDis is superior to other existing schemes in terms of total freshness value, total delivered contents, and total transmission cost."
1741243,13990,208,Change Awareness in Opportunistic Networks,2013,"The metrics of information latency and reach ability are widely used for measuring information flow in opportunistic networks. We present an alternative measure that looks at the amount of information updates or changes, which is an important and yet relatively unexplored metric for characterizing opportunistic networks. In this paper, we propose a novel concept to measure information freshness - how much the latest information received differs from the most up-to-date information on the sender. Based on the information freshness, the awareness on how information propagated may have changed, or change awareness, can be computed. Change awareness can be exploited to design efficient algorithms, in particular, data aggregation algorithms. Evaluation on real world traces shows that change awareness based solutions can achieve similar results as data aggregation algorithm with connection oracles."
1087743,13990,208,Time Varying Doppler-Shift Compensation for OFDM-Based Shallow Underwater Acoustic Communication Systems,2011,"In this paper, a time varying Doppler-shift compensation scheme for wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) suitable for shallow water communications is proposed. This scheme accommodates a channel model having velocity that accelerate and de-accelerate during a packet of multiple OFDM frames. Furthermore, it assumes that the Doppler-shift varies linearly during the symbol time. To deal with this variation, the time expansion/compression is measured within a fraction of the sample period and then compensated using sample-by-sample interpolation. The Doppler-shift and its residual are frequently estimated during the symbol time to mitigate the inter-carrier interference (ICI) by estimating the first order moment of the cyclic prefix correlation. Additionally, in this technique, the fractional deviation of the sub-carrier spacing, which is considered to be the source of ICI, is estimated by exploiting the fractional part of the normalized sampling frequency offset. The proposed algorithm performance is investigated with real data obtained from an experiment that took place in the North Sea in 2009. In addition, results show that the technique is robust and more pragmatic than existing cyclic prefix (CP)-based algorithms."
1485825,13990,208,SASHA: A Distributed Protocol for Secure Application Deployment in Shared Ad-Hoc Wireless Sensor Networks,2011,"Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks in industrial settings often consist of multiple independent parties, each owning a subset of the nodes. In order to reduce costs, minimize time to market and increase coverage and functionality, these parties must share the capabilities of their individual sensor nodes; this creates a multi-owner and multi-application environment that requires advanced and secure mechanisms to control the deployment and operation of sensor applications. Although there is clear demand like in transport & logistics, state-of-the-art on secure application deployment in WSNs is lacking support for this sharing of sensor nodes. This paper presents SASHA: a proof-of-concept protocol that enables lightweight and secure deployment of multiple applications on heterogeneously owned sensor nodes."
1491549,13990,208,A Framework for Mobile Data Offloading to Leased Cache-Endowed Small Cell Networks,2014,"Cache-endowed small cell networks constitute a timely and effective solution for mobile network operators (MNOs) who strive to serve the massive content demand of the mobile users. However, the deployment of small cell base stations (SBSs) requires significant economic investments, while site acquisition issues render it infeasible in several cases. Yet, one potentially explosive factor for network expansion remains unexploited, namely, an increasing number of residential users install in their premises privately-owned SBSs (femtocell or WiFi access points) in order to serve their own needs. In this work, we envision an MNO offering incentives to the SBS owners to cache and deliver content items requested by the nearby mobile users. We model the interaction between the MNO and the SBS owners as a Stackelberg game, and show that the incentive design problem requires to know the content caching policy, which in turn should be jointly derived with the request routing policy. We then introduce a framework for the joint derivation of incentive, caching and routing policies. Numerical results indicate that our mechanism provides a substantial potential for reducing the MNO's costs, depending on the willingness of the SBS owners to lease their resources and the spatio temporal characteristics of the mobile data demand."
1670948,13990,208,Optimal Hierarchical Power Scheduling for Cooperative Microgrids,2014,"As advances are made in single Microgrid (MG) systems, the problem of cooperation among MGs and the Macrogrid has attracted considerable interest only recently. As in wireless communications systems, exploiting the temporal, spatial, and technological diversities in multiple cooperative MGs could bring about more efficient power generation and distribution. This paper investigates a hierarchical power scheduling approach to optimally manage the power trading, storage and distribution in a smart power grid with a Macrogrid and cooperative MGs. We first present a two-tier formulation: the first-tier problem jointly considers user utility, transmission cost, and grid load variance, while the second-tier problem minimizes the power generation and transmission cost and exploits distributed storage in the MGs. We develop an effective online algorithm to solve the first-tier problem and prove its asymptotic optimality, and develop a distributed optimal algorithm for solving the second-tier problem. The proposed hierarchical power scheduling algorithms are evaluated with trace-driven simulations and are shown to outperform several existing schemes with considerable gains."

It also allows hybrid sharedmemory / message-passing programming, exploiting fully the availability of multiprocessor and multi-core nodes, as it integrates by design with OpenMP; the runtime infrastructure presents a unified substrate that handles local threads and remote tasks seamlessly, allowing both programming flexibility and increased performance opportunities."
1432942,13990,208,Creating secured electronic medical record framework for mobile devices,2012,"This demo will demonstrate implementation of a secured EMR (Electronic Medical Record) system that can be used by Physicians, Nurses, Patient Care Technician and Dietician in a Dialysis Center setting. Although substantial work has been done for applications using a desktop browser, only few operations have been implemented on mobile devices. The line between the native and web application development does not have to be crystal clear and there could be a third model which is gradually evolving in creating a hybrid application that could combine strengths of both the native and web technology. The EMR set up consisting of an iPod, an iPhone and a desktop browser and shown in Figure 1, provides a workflow for a patient coming for a dialysis treatment, accounts for Patient Demographics, track orders written by Physicians, keep current intake of medications and sends notifications to Physicians and Nurses on record updates. All modules have numerous functions such as add, edit and view. We show the user's login following patient's demographics screen in Figure 2 and Figure 3 respectively. The top-level menu items consist of Patient, Search and E-sign modules. Figure 3 shows the “Add Patient” option from the menu. Once the patient is served, the user can search for a specific patient and get an extended menu items as shown in Figure 4. These menu items include editing a patient, add/edit physician's and standing orders, add/edit home and in-center medications. Once the patient extended information has been saved, the patient is ready for a dialysis treatment. A complete workflow for the treatment is captured with the workflow module as illustrated in Figure 5."
1996986,13990,20348,Identifying drug (cocaine) intake events from acute physiological response in the presence of free-living physical activity,2014,"A variety of health and behavioral states can potentially be inferred from physiological measurements that can now be collected in the natural free-living environment. The major challenge, however, is to develop computational models for automated detection of health events that can work reliably in the natural field environment. In this paper, we develop a physiologically-informed model to automatically detect drug (cocaine) use events in the free-living environment of participants from their electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. The key to reliably detecting drug use events in the field is to incorporate the knowledge of autonomic nervous system (ANS) behavior in the model development so as to decompose the activation effect of cocaine from the natural recovery behavior of the parasympathetic nervous system (after an episode of physical activity). We collect 89 days of data from 9 active drug users in two residential lab environments and 922 days of data from 42 active drug users in the field environment, for a total of 11,283 hours. We develop a model that tracks the natural recovery by the parasympathetic nervous system and then estimates the dampening caused to the recovery by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system due to cocaine. We develop efficient methods to screen and clean the ECG time series data and extract candidate windows to assess for potential drug use. We then apply our model on the recovery segments from these windows. Our model achieves 100% true positive rate while keeping the false positive rate to 0.87/day over (9+ hours/day of) lab data and to 1.13/day over (11+ hours/day of) field data."
2080850,13990,30,Automatic Detection of Temporal Gait Parameters in Poststroke Individuals,2011,"Approximately one-third of people who recover from a stroke require some form of assistance to walk. Repetitive task-oriented rehabilitation interventions have been shown to improve motor control and function in people with stroke. Our long-term goal is to design and test an intensive task-oriented intervention that will utilize the two primary components of constrained-induced movement therapy: massed, task-oriented training and behavioral methods to increase use of the affected limb in the real world. The technological component of the intervention is based on a wearable footwear-based sensor system that monitors relative activity levels, functional utilization, and gait parameters of affected and unaffected lower extremities. The purpose of this study is to describe a methodology to automatically identify temporal gait parameters of poststroke individuals to be used in assessment of functional utilization of the affected lower extremity as a part of behavior enhancing feedback. An algorithm accounting for intersubject variability is capable of achieving estimation error in the range of 2.6-18.6% producing comparable results for healthy and poststroke subjects. The proposed methodology is based on inexpensive and user-friendly technology that will enable research and clinical applications for rehabilitation of people who have experienced a stroke."

A mapping is given between the elements of R and the alphabet {A, C, G, T} which allows the additive stem distance to be extended to this ring. Then, cyclic codes over R are designed such that their images under the mapping are also cyclic or quasi-cyclic of index 2 with designed hybridization energy. The hybridization energy and additive distance are shown to be functions of the neighborhood energy."

There have been recent efforts to provide ecologists with a tool to study the multifaceted behavior of the endangered species. Like many species, cranes display distinctly identifiable movements while being threatened, acting territorial, migrating, or preening. The preliminary experiments described in this poster provide evidence that sensor data presented by a novel sensing platform, the CraneTracker, can be used to identify crane behaviors on-board. With the ability to identify these behaviors, ecologists will have a more granular insight on what occurs during a crane's life on a daily basis."
1480460,13990,208,You unlocked the Mt. Everest badge on foursquare! Countering location fraud in Geosocial Networks,2012,"GeoSocial Networks (GSNs) are online social networks centered on the location information of their users. Users “check-in” their location and use it to acquire location-based special status (e.g., badges, mayorships) and receive venue dependent rewards. The strategy of rewarding user participation however makes cheating a profitable behavior. In this paper we introduce XACT, a suite of venue-oriented secure location verification mechanisms that enable venues and GSN providers to certify the locations claimed by users. We prove that XACT is correct, secure and easy to use. We validate the need for secure location verification mechanisms by collecting and analyzing data from the most popular GSNs today: 780,000 Foursquare users and 143,000 Gowalla users. Through a proof-of-concept implementation on a Revision C4 BeagleBoard embedded system we show that XACT is easy to deploy and economically viable. We analytically and empirically prove that XACT detects location cheating attacks."
2031164,13990,22021,Hyper-bent functions via Dillon-like exponents,2012,"This paper is devoted to hyper-bent functions with multiple trace terms (including binomial functions) via Dillon-like exponents. We show how the approach developed by Mesnager to extend the Charpin — Gong family, which was also used by Wang et al. to obtain another similar extension, fits in a much more general setting. To this end, we first explain how the original restriction for Charpin — Gong criterion can be weakened before generalizing the Mesnager approach to arbitrary Dillon-like exponents. Afterward, we tackle the problem of devising infinite families of extension degrees for which a given exponent is valid and apply these results not only to reprove straightforwardly the results of Mesnager, and Wang et al., but also to characterize the hyper-bentness of new infinite classes of Boolean functions."
2262636,13990,9015,Team-level programming of drone sensor networks,2014,"Autonomous drones are a powerful new breed of mobile sensing platform that can greatly extend the capabilities of traditional sensing systems. Unfortunately, it is still non-trivial to coordinate multiple drones to perform a task collaboratively. We present a novel programming model called  team-level programming  that can express collaborative sensing tasks without exposing the complexity of managing multiple drones, such as concurrent programming, parallel execution, scaling, and failure recovering. We create the Voltron programming system to explore the concept of team-level programming in active sensing applications. Voltron offers programming constructs to create the illusion of a simple sequential execution model while still maximizing opportunities to dynamically re-task the drones as needed. We implement Voltron by targeting a popular aerial drone platform, and evaluate the resulting system using a combination of real deployments, user studies, and emulation. Our results indicate that Voltron enables simpler code and produces marginal overhead in terms of CPU, memory, and network utilization. In addition, it greatly facilitates implementing correct and complete collaborative drone applications, compared to existing drone programming systems."
2409639,13990,20348,Sensing through the continent: towards monitoring migratory birds using cellular sensor networks,2012,"ABSTRACT This paper presents CraneTracker, a novel sensor platform for monitoring migratory birds. The platform is designed to monitor Whooping Cranes, an endangered species that conducts an annual migration of 4,000 km between southern Texas and north-central Canada. CraneTracker includes a rich set of sensors, a multi-modal radio, and power control circuitry for sustainable, continental-scale information delivery during migration. The need for large-scale connectivity motivates the use of cellular technology in low-cost sensor platforms augmented by a low-power transceiver for ad-hoc connectivity. This platform leads to a new class of cellular sensor networks (CSNs) for time-critical and mobile sensing applications. The CraneTracker is evaluated via field tests on Wild Turkeys, Siberian Cranes, and an on-going alpha deployment with wild Sandhill Cranes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the potential of energy-harvesting CSNs for wildlife monitoring in large geographical areas, and reveal important insights into the movements and behaviors of migratory animals. In addition to benefiting ecological research, the developed platform is expected to extend the application domain of sensor networks and enable future research applications."
1419356,13990,208,A framework for frameless TDMA using slot chains,2012,"TDMA MAC protocols suffer from two draw-backs that have reduced its practical appeal, especially for infrastructure-less wireless networks: the need for time synchronization, and the use of Jrames. While there has been extensive research towards achieving the required time synchronization, the frames are assumed to be inherent in TDMA. In this paper we present a framework for frameless TDMA based on a new concept we refer to as a slot chain. A slot chain is a series of slots with a starting slot and inter-slot period that is chosen to match a given capacity request. The key challenge in using slot chains instead of frames is ensuring that slot chains representing arbitrary capacity requests are conflict free. We present an algorithm for interleaving slot chains in a conflict-free manner. The algorithm is optimal for a class of requests called geometric and is z-approximate for general requests, where z can be made arbitrarily small. We show that any TDMA MAC protocol can readily replace using frames with using slot chains. Our simulation analysis shows that using slot chains results in much better capacity utilization when traffic is heterogeneous — as much as 100% in some cases."
895230,13990,208,HTTP-CoAP cross protocol proxy: an implementation viewpoint,2012,"In recent years there has been growing interest for the vision of a so-called Web of Things, which pursues the access to a wide variety of everyday objects through a regular web browser. We believe that this vision is right now at a key moment in its realization, analogous to the '90 for the World Wide Web. The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), a web protocol optimized for constrained networks and devices, will hopefully help wireless sensor nodes, a.k.a., smart objects, to become active citizens of the web. Indeed, CoAP has been designed to be easily mapped to HTTP. In this paper we discuss the HTTP mapping of CoAP, and we highlight its different facets and issues. We will describe what are the currently open issues, spanning the deployment of an HTTP-CoAP proxy to the security mapping issues. We also share the authors' experience gained in the design and implementation of two distinct HTTP-CoAP proxies."
1775232,13990,208,Towards City-Scale Smartphone Sensing of Potentially Unsafe Pedestrian Movements,2014,"This paper proposes large scale collection of pedestrian movement data to promote pedestrian safety in our rapidly developing urban environments. As a first step, we develop and test algorithms for sensing unsafe pedestrian movements. With distracted pedestrian fatalities on the rise, and larger than ever use of smart devices, we propose to use the smartphone to protect pedestrians by leveraging the in-built inertial sensors on the smartphone. We discuss how to use these sensors for recognizing user movements that could be potentially risky when walking on the street, while also accounting for different phone orientations. We introduce a simple path prediction technique and use this to compute potential street crossings. In order to evaluate our algorithms, we conducted walking trials and collected data from all relevant sensors. Initial tests indicate a 90.5% success rate in predicting that a pedestrians trajectory will cross a road."
1146960,13990,208,ECPC: Preserve Downtime Data Persistence in Disruptive Sensor Networks,2013,"In challenging environments, sensor networks may become disruptive even unavailable (downtime), resulting in data losses. In-situ encoding and caching data in a distributed fashion can preserve data persistence during downtime. However, the existing approaches are mainly based on random walks, which incurs significant communication overhead and may itself fail due to network disruptions. In this paper, we present a distributed Erasure Coding with randomized Power Control (ECPC) mechanism to preserve downtime data persistence in disruptive sensor networks. ECPC only requires each node to perform a single broadcast at each of its several randomly selected power levels. Thus it incurs low communication overhead. Moreover the storage space requirement is lower and uniform across the network. It applies randomized power control in localized data broadcast to achieve expected code degree distribution and ensure pseudo-global randomness for erasure coding. Performance comparisons between ECPC and other existing approaches show that ECPC mechanism can reach higher data reliability under varying node failure probabilities. In addition, our ECPC approach is scalable with network sizes."
1586104,13990,208,The Monitoring Core: A framework for sensor security application development,2012,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used for the monitoring of physical and environmental phenomena, and applicable in a range of different domains (e.g., health care, military, critical infrastructure). When using WSNs in a variety of real-world applications, security is a vital problem that should be considered by developers. As the development of security applications (SAs) for WSNs require meticulous procedures and operations, the software implementation process can be more challenging than regular applications. Hence, in an effort to facilitate the design, development and implementation of WSN security applications, we introduce the Monitoring Core (M-Core). The M-Core is a modular, lightweight, and extensible software layer that gathers necessary data including the internal and the external status of the sensor (e.g., information about ongoing communications, neighbors, and sensing), and provides relevant information for the development of new SAs. Similar to other software development tools, the M-Core was developed to facilitate the design and development of new WSN SAs on different platforms. Moreover, a new user-friendly domain-specific language, the M-Core Control Language (MCL), was developed to further facilitate the use of the M-Core and reduce the developer's coding time. With the MCL, a user can implement new SAs without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying sensor software architecture (e.g., TinyOS). The M-Core has been implemented in TinyOS-2.x and tested on real sensors (Tmote Sky and MicaZ). Using the M-Core architecture, we implemented several SAs to show that the M-Core allows easy and rapid development of security programs efficiently and effectively."
1545853,13990,208,The Trajectory Exposure Problem in Location-Aware Mobile Networking,2011,"Location information improves the routing effectiveness and facilitates the development of diverse novel applications in mobile networking. While they can lead to better user experiences, given privacy concerns and hardware constraints, a mobile user often exposes a limited number of locations only. We are thus interested in the Trajectory Exposure Problem in this context, i.e., to what degree that the user's trajectory (i.e., its route) is exposed? Furthermore, can the user adaptively control the exposure of its trajectory and yet offer useful information for location-based services? In this paper, we explore Gaussian Process Regression, an effective tool to re-construct the trajectory of the mobile user with selected exposed locations. We examine how the re-constructed trajectory differs from the real trajectory, i.e., evaluating the exposure rate. We present an effective heuristic that adaptively controls the trajectory exposure rate by carefully choosing the exposed locations. We further demonstrate a practical routing protocol, MoRPTE, which, controlled by a single parameter, utilizes location information flexibly and adaptively in the spectrum from zero knowledge to full knowledge to fit the applications' demands."
684290,13990,208,Physical Layer Network Coding with Signal Alignment for MIMO Wireless Networks,2011,"We propose signal alignment (SA), a new wireless communication technique that enables physical layer network coding (PNC) in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wireless net- works. Through calculated precoding, SA contracts the perceived signal space at a node to match its receive diversity, and hence facilitates the demodulation of linearly combined data packets. PNC coupled with SA (PNC-SA) has the potential of fully exploiting the precoding space at the senders, and can better utilize the spatial diversity of a MIMO network for higher transmission rates, outperforming existing techniques including MIMO or PNC alone, interference alignment (IA) and interference alignment and cancellation (IAC). PNC-SA adopts the seminal idea of'demodulate a linear combination'from PNC. The design of PNC-SA is also inspired by recent advances in IA, though SA alignssignalsnotinterferences. We study the optimal precoding and power allocation problem of PNC-SA, for SNR maximization at the receiver. The mapping from SNR to BER is then analyzed,revealing that the throughput gain of PNC-SA does not come with a sacrifice in BER. Wefinally demonstrate general applications of PNC-SA, and show via network level simulations that it can substantially increase the throughput of unicast and multicast sessions, by opening previously unexplored solution spaces in multi-hop MIMO routing."
1553497,13990,208,Connecting the web with the web of things: lessons learned from implementing a CoAP-HTTP proxy,2012,"The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a lightweight application layer protocol for the Internet of Things. CoAP is based on HTTP mechanisms to build RESTful Web services. In contrast to HTTP, CoAP was designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and uses a binary representation. This allows efficient transport and processing in resource-constrained networks such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Due to the analogy to REST, a mapping between CoAP and HTTP is possible. In this paper one of the first translating CoAP-HTTP proxies is presented, that provides HTTP clients transparent access to CoAP resources and vice versa. Furthermore, caching relieves CoAP servers, which solves a key challenge for the Internet of Things: to allow a constant/permanent availability of resources from a network of constrained devices, which are required to minimize data transmissions due to their noticeable restrictions in power consumption. We describe, which issues of the translation we found during the time of implementation and testing, and explain how the proxy handles these issues. Finally, an evaluation, using real WSN hardware, is given, and an approximation scheme on how much transmissions can be saved by caching resources is provided."
955726,13990,22164,A model of auditory deviance detection,2013,"A key component in computational analysis of the auditory environment is the detection of novel sounds in the scene. Deviance detection aids in the segmentation of auditory objects and is also the basis of bottom-up auditory saliency, which is crucial in directing attention to relevant events. There is growing evidence that deviance detection is executed in the brain through mapping of the temporal regularities in the acoustic scene. The violation of these regularities is reflected as mismatch negativity (MMN), a signature electrical response observed using electro-encephalograpy (EEG) or magneto-encephalograpy (MEG). While numerous experimental results have quantified the properties of this MMN response, there have been few attempts at developing general computational frameworks of MMN that can be integrated in comprehensive models of scene analysis. In this work, we interpret the underlying mechanism of the MMN response as a Kalman-filter formulation that provides a recursive prediction of sound features based on the past sensory information; eliciting an MMN when predictions are violated. The model operates in a high-dimensional space, mimicking the rich set of features that underlie sound encoding up the level of auditory cortex. We test the proposed scheme on a variety of simple oddball paradigms adapted to various features of sounds: Pitch, intensity, direction, and inter-stimulus interval. Our model successfully finds the deviant onset times when the deviant varies from the standard in one or more of the calculated dimensions. Our results not only lay a foundation for modeling more complex elicitations of MMN, but also provide a versatile and robust mechanism for outlier detection in temporal signals and ultimately parsing of auditory scenes."
1234768,13990,22021,Distillation of multi-party non-locality with and without partial communication,2013,"Non-local correlations are one of the most fascinating consequences of quantum physics from the point of view of information: Such correlations, although not allowing for signaling, are unexplainable by pre-shared information. The correlations have applications in cryptography, communication complexity, and sit at the very heart of many attempts of understanding quantum theory - and its limits - better in terms of classical information. In these contexts, the question is crucial whether such correlations can be distilled, i.e., whether weak correlations can be used for generating (a smaller amount of) stronger. Whereas the question has been studied quite extensively for bipartite correlations (yielding both pessimistic and optimistic results), only little is known in the multi-partite case. We show that a natural generalization of the well-known Popsecu-Rohrlich box can be distilled, by an adaptive protocol, to the algebraic maximum. We use this result further to show that a much bigger class of correlations, including all purely three-partite correlations, can be distilled from arbitrarily weak to maximal strength with partial communication, i.e., using only a subset of the channels required for the creation of the same correlation from scratch. In other words, we show that arbitrarily weak non-local correlations can have a “communication value” in the context of the generation of maximal non-locality."

We propose quantitative criteria to rank genes as markers of a brain region, based on the localization of the gene expression and on its functional fitting to the shape of the region. These criteria lead to natural generalizations to sets of genes. We find sets of genes weighted with coefficients of both signs with almost perfect localization in all major regions of the left hemisphere of the brain, except the pallidum. Generalization of the fitting criterion with positivity constraint provides a lesser improvement of the markers, but requires sparser sets of genes."

This family of sequences were shown by Wooters and Fields to be useful for quantum state tomography. Alltop's construction used a function that is not planar, but whose difference function is planar. In this paper we show that Alltop type functions cannot exist in fields of characteristic 3 and that for a known class of planar functions, x 3  is the only Alltop type function."
2397162,13990,22021,A lattice of gambles,2011,"A gambler walks into a hypothetical fair casino with a very real dollar bill, but by the time he leaves he's exchanged that for a random amount of money. What is lost in the process? It may be that the gambler walks out at the end of the day, after a roller-coaster ride of winning and losing, with his dollar still intact—or maybe even with two dollars. But what the gambler loses the moment he places his first bet is position. He exchanges one distribution of money for a distribution of lesser value, and he can't get back to the original distribution. Our first discussion in this work connects known results of economic inequality and majorization to the probability theory of gambling and Martingales. We provide a simple proof that fair gambles cannot increase the Lorenz curve, and we also constructively demonstrate that any sequence of non-increasing Lorenz curves corresponds to at least one Martingale. We next consider the efficiency of gambles. If any fair gamble is available then one can move down the lattice of distributions with respect to the Lorenz ordering. The step from one distribution to the next is not unique. Is there a sense of efficiency with which one can move down the Lorenz stream? One approach would be to minimize the average total volume of money placed on the table. In this case, it turns out that implementing part of the strategy using private randomness can help reduce the need for the casino's randomness, resulting in less money on the table that the casino can get its hands on."

However, the kernel can behave in unusual (yet permissible) ways for which applications are badly unprepared. We present Murphy, a language-agnostic tool that helps developers discover and isolate run-time failures in their programs by simulating difficult-to-reproduce but completely-legitimate interactions between the application and the kernel. Murphy makes it easy to enable or disable sets of kernel interactions, called gremlins, so developers can focus on the failure scenarios that are important to them. Gremlins are implemented using the ptrace interface, intercepting and potentially modifying an application's system call invocation while requiring no invasive changes to the host machine.#R##N##R##N#We show how to use Murphy in a variety of modes to find different classes of errors, present examples of the kernel interactions that are tested, and explain how to apply delta debugging techniques to isolate the code causing the failure. While our primary goal was the development of a tool to assist in new software development, we successfully demonstrate that Murphy also has the capability to find bugs in hardened, widely-deployed software."
2110957,13990,22021,Perfect signaling among three parties violating predefined causal order,2014,"The paradigmatic view where information is seen as a more fundamental concept than the laws of physics leads to a different understanding of spacetime where the causal order of events emerges from correlations between random variables representing physical quantities. In particular, such an information-theoretic approach does not enforce a global spacetime structure. By following this path, we conclude that perfect signaling correlations among three parties are possible which do not obey the restrictions imposed by global spacetime. We show this using a recent framework based on the sole assumptions that locally, quantum theory is valid and random variables can be described by probability distributions. Our result is of zero-error type and is an analog to a tripartite appearance of quantum non-locality which manifests itself by satisfying a condition with certainty whereas the same is impossible for any local theory."

In fact, computers have evolved from boxes with which it was possible to interact solely using mice, keyboards and monitors, to become devices that permeate and intersect with the space where human beings live and move, being now capable of interpreting their gestures as long as mixing with and contain the objects that surround them. Such richness has been widely employed within new and engaging computer games, where it is now possible to play while moving and connecting to the virtual characters that compose mixed worlds, directly from home. However, such potential is far from being fully exploited everywhere. In public spaces such as museums and exhibitions, for example, new means of interaction and mixed worlds could contemporarily reach two goals: (a) augment the user experience, and, (b) increase visitors' accessibility to all artifacts. In this work we show how both goals have been achieved with the devise and implementation of Mercator Atlas Robot, an application that supports the exploration of Mercator's World Atlas, the book that first has wholly described the world through a collection of maps. In particular, we here describe how the combination of a gestural interface and mixed reality paradigms has let visitors travel through Mercator's volume in a simple and intuitive way. All this has been possible with only low cost, off-the-shelf, hardware, where all the intelligence is entirely based on software components."

Using NMC, if an attacker modifies a codeword, decoding this modified codeword will return either the original message or a completely unrelated value. The property of non-malleability depends on a family of modifications authorized to the attacker. In their paper, Dziem-bowski et al. propose a construction valid for the family of all bit-wise independent functions. At ITW 2011, Chabanne et al. proposed another construction for non-malleable codes w.r.t. bit-wise independent tampering functions by drawing a parallel between NMC and the Wire-Tap Channel II. In this paper, we show that the construction using Linear Coset Coding proposed by Chabanne et al. is non-malleable w.r.t. a larger class of functions, by considering linear tampering. Our results are derived from security results on Secure Network Coding using Linear Coset Coding, introduced by El Rouayheb and Soljanin at ISIT 2007."

However, to realize this promise, we must develop new data capture, processing and modeling techniques to convert the digital exhaust emitted by mobile phone use into behavioral biomarkers. This calls for a modular layered sensemaking framework in which low level state classifications of raw data (e.g., estimated activity states such as sitting, walking, driving from continuous accelerometer and location traces), are used to derive mid-level semantic features (e.g., total number of ambulatory minutes, number of hours spent out of house), that can then be mapped to particular behavioral biomarkers for specific diseases (e.g., chronic pain, GI disfunction, MS, fatigue, depression, etc). The techniques needed to derive these markers will range from simple functions to machine learning classifiers, and will need to fuse diverse data types, but all will need to cope with noisy, erratic data sources. We are working to build an open architecture and community to speed the rate and robustness of innovation in this space, both academic and commercial (http://openmhealth.org)."

Open Flow, a SDN standard, is currently the only standard that explicitly focuses on multi-vendor openness. Unfortunately, it only provides for traffic engineering on an integrated basis for L2-L4. The obvious approaches to expand Open Flow's reach to L7, would be to enhance the data path flow table, or to utilize the controller for deep packet inspection, both introduces significant scalability barriers. We propose and prototype an enhancement to Open Flow based on the idea of an External Processing Box (EPB) optionally attached to forwarding engines, however, we use existing protocol extension constructs to control the EPB as an integrated part of the Open Flow data path. This provides network operators with the ability to use L7-based policies to control service insertion and traffic steering, without breaking the open paradigm. This novel yet eminently practical augmentation of Open Flow provides added value critical for realistic networking practice. Retention of multi-vendor openness for such an approach has not been previously reported in literature to the best of our knowledge. We report numerical results from our prototype, characterizing the performance and practicality of this prototype by implementing a video reconditioning application on this platform."
2304703,13990,8960,Tight Bounds on Profile Redundancy and Distinguishability,2012,"The minimax KL-divergence of any distribution from all distributions in a collection P has several practical implications. In compression, it is called redundancy and represents the least additional number of bits over the entropy needed to encode the output of any distribution in Ƥ. In online estimation and learning, it is the lowest expected log-loss regret when guessing a sequence of random values generated by a distribution in Ƥ. In hypothesis testing, it upper bounds the largest number of distinguishable distributions in Ƥ. Motivated by problems ranging from population estimation to text classification and speech recognition, several machine-learning and information-theory researchers have recently considered label-invariant observations and properties induced by i.i.d. distributions. A sufficient statistic for all these properties is the data's profile, the multiset of the number of times each data element appears. Improving on a sequence of previous works, we show that the redundancy of the collection of distributions induced over profiles by length-n i.i.d. sequences is between 0.3 · n1/3 and n1/3 log2 n, in particular, establishing its exact growth power."

This causes congestion and reduces the successful delivery ratio of messages from other nodes. This paper adopts pigeonhole principle and power in combinatorics to define node's responsibility range of message transfer for other nodes. It is helpful for the nodes to selectively accept messages which are required to be transferred and deliver them. The algorithm should restrict the selfish behavior of selfish nodes, reduce network congestion and guarantee the reasonable share of storage resource by all nodes according to the communication frequent degree. The experiment proves that congestion control routing algorithm against node selfish behavior based on pigeonhole principle (CRASP) proposed in this paper excellently achieves the above objectives."

In this paper, we provide a practical solution for turn-to-turn guidance with inter-vehicle communication in vehicle ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Vehicles collect information from neighbors and catch the snapshot to describe the global impact of traffic congestions, in the presence of unpredictable changes of topology and vehicle trajectory. Without any centralized control, the information can be aggregated along the traffic flow and be disseminated in a minimal area, while sufficiently guiding each vehicle to achieve a global optimization on its path, and to remain on a non-blocked route. The information constitution is implemented in the proactive model, saving the delay of reconstruction in the reactive model (on-demand). Its substantial improvement on the elapsed time will be shown in the experimental results, compared with the best results known to date in both proactive and reactive information models."
1711779,13990,208,Enhancing wireless communication privacy with artificial fading,2012,"This paper addresses the problem of anti-eavesdropping in wireless network physical layer. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel concept of artificial fading that is produced by double-beam switching of smart antenna array to intentionally corrupt unwanted wireless communication links. Second, we develop a physical layer anti-eavesdropping scheme to minimize the unnecessary coverage area, and hence, lower the chance of being eavesdropped. Our anti-eavesdropping scheme employs smart antenna with two synthesized radiation patterns, which are optimized to provide good signal quality to the intended receiver, while their overlap apart from the intended direction is minimized. During the transmission, the transmitter periodically alternates between the two optimized patterns at a high frequency, which produces severe fading to the received signal in undesired directions. Since such signals are corrupted and cannot be decoded, eavesdropping is prevented. Simulation experiments show that our anti-eavesdropping scheme outperforms single pattern beamforming in reducing the unnecessary coverage area exposed to eavesdroppers."

We propose in this work to exploit this novel concept of D2D as a new alternative for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Vehicle-to-Vehicle/Infrastructure (V2X) communications in next generation cellular networks. A 3GPP standard architecture has been recently defined to support Proximity Services (ProSe) in the LTE core network. Taking into account the limitations of this latter and the requirements of ITS services and V2X communications, we propose the CVN solution as an enhancement to the ProSe architecture in order to support hyper-local ITS services. CVN provides a reliable and scalable LTE-assisted opportunistic model for V2X communications through a distributed ProSe architecture. Using a hybrid clustering approach, vehicles are organized into dynamic clusters that are formed and managed by ProSe Cluster Heads which are elected centrally by the CVN core network. ITS services are deemed as Proximity Services and benefit from the basic ProSe discovery, authorization and authentication mechanisms. The CVN solution enhances V2V communication delays and overhead by reducing the need for multi-hop geo-routing. Preliminary simulation results show that the CVN solution provides short setup times and improves ITS communication delays."

The Lorenz curve associated to a memoryless source can be used to obtain upper bounds on the distortion rate function, thus characterizing source compressibility. It is shown that an order relation on Lorenz curves induces an analogous relation on distortion rate upper bounds. This can be used to characterize the compressibility of certain parametric families of source distributions, for which an order on the parameters induces an order on Lorenz curves."

IntroductionAccording to a survey conducted by International Telecom-munication Union (ITU) in 2003, more than 2.5 billion people(which is 40% of the total population) still live in remoteand rural areas with limited communication access [1]. Worsemore, electricity supply in most rural areas is always insuﬃ-cient or even non-existent. Therefore, how to power the BSs inrural areas is a challenging issue facing developing countriesand even the world.To address this challenge, energy harvesting has been in-troduced into communication industry as the power source ofBSs in rural areas. Now BSs that harvest renewable energy,such as solar and wind, are gradually deployed in some ruralareas throughout the world. For instance, China Mobile hadestablished the world’s largest solar energy BS cluster inTibet [2]. Moreover, among the 1000+BSs in Tibet, about80% of them are powered by solar energy. This reveals thepotential of energy harvesting techniques to be applied in ruralcommunications and future’s green communications.If the traﬃc has no large variations, energy output of BSsshould be stable to guarantee high QoS and high energyeﬃciency. In this work, we consider that BSs only use theharvested energy and have no alternative energy source toback up. In this case, the prediction of future energy arrivalsis important, since it can balance the energy storage andenergy output in the temporal domain. More accurately, traﬃcmodeling will be considered in our future work, such thatenergy output matches the traﬃc. Notably, when the batterycapacity is large enough, we can use a constant energy outputrate that equals to the average energy input rate. However,batteries with very large capacity increase the deployment costdramatically. Therefore, with limited battery capacity, goodenergy allocation algorithms are needed to best allocate theharvested energy.In this paper, we only consider BSs equipped with solarpanel. Solar energy models have been systematically studiedby geographers and meteorologists since 1970s. However,most models are too complex to be applied, and not allof the parameters are always available. For instance, in themodel contributed by [3]–[6], air pressure, temperature, watervapor, oxygen, ozone, aerosol and spectrum are all included.Therefore, our work begins by presenting a simple and generalsolar energy model.For resource scheduling in energy harvesting communica-tions, much work has been done either in diﬀerent scenarios, orwith diﬀerent targets, or in diﬀerent methods. For instance, [7]proposes energy-neural mode that can use as much energy aspossible from the environment in sensor networks. [8] presentsoptimal energy management schemes in energy harvestingsystems with fading channels to maximize the number of bitssent within a deadline. Moreover, the duration that all thepackets are delivered is minimized by changing transmissionrate according to traﬃc load and available energy in [9], andthe short-term throughput is maximized for a link with anenergy harvesting transmitter in [10]. However, most of thework just assumes random energy arrivals and doesn’t takeinto account the energy arrival prediction, which will be solvedin our work.The main contributions of this work are:"
809768,13990,8228,Precoding optimization for the sparse MC-CDMA downlink communication,2014,"We introduce a novel Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) system, where random sparse signatures are deployed in the frequency domain. Data symbols transmitted from base station (BS) to mobile stations (MSs) are drawn from discrete finite alphabets, such as M-QAM constellations. Transmitter-based precoding is introduced so as to allow simple despreading followed by single-user detection at MSs. A power-efficient non-linear precoding optimization problem is formulated by imposing minimum Symbol Error Probability (SEP) targets at MSs. We first elaborate on how to translate the SEP targets into exact constraint regions on noiseless received components at MSs. With relaxation on the exact regions, a tractable convex problem is obtained. A dual- decomposition-based algorithm is then developed to accommo- date parallel processors to perform precoding calculation. The signature sparsity turns out to be vital to reduce interprocessor communication overhead and computational complexity for pre- coding. The scheme proposed offers considerable transmit power reduction compared with the conventional zero-forcing precoder. I. INTRODUCTION Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) is a multi-access scheme based on the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) method. In this paper, we introduce a novel MC-CDMA that uses sparse signature sequences. Sparse signature sequences have been used in uplink CDMA analyses (1)-(3) but have not so far been considered for downlink systems. In the uplink papers, sparsity is exploited to provide a distributed, message-passing approach to the uplink multi-user detection problem. In particular, the belief-propagation algorithm has been proposed for such a system, an algorithm that has a natural implementation using parallel processors, and one that is fast and accurate, provided that the graphs are asymptotic cycle-free (2), (3). In this paper, we formulate a different problem, appropriate for the downlink, but one that also has a natural implemen- tation using parallel processors. The solution to the problem provides an algorithm for precoding at the base station (BS). As with the earlier uplink results, the algorithm is implemented at the BS, and the mobile stations (MSs) use conventional single-user matched filters and standard symbol detection. We compare the performance of our algorithm with standard lin- ear, zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, and show that considerable savings in transmit power are achievable using our approach. MC-CDMA naturally integrates the advantages of CDMA with the robustness to frequency selectivity offered by OFDM. Since its invention (4), MC-CDMA has attracted broad inter- est, see, e.g., (5), (6), and it serves as one of the promising candidates to provide reliable high data-rate communication. One main advantage of MC-CDMA as compared to Or- thogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA) is a reduced requirement in terms of the coordination required amongst the users. Rather than require all intracell users to be perfectly orthogonal, random signature sequences can be used which do not have to be precisely orthogonal to each other. On the other hand, there is a resulting loss in spectral efficiency, and an increased complexity in the signal processing required. On the uplink, the complexity is in the multi-user detection. On the downlink, the complexity is in the nonlinear precoding that we propose in this paper. Analogous to the known results for the uplink, we show that, with sparse signature sequences, the downlink problem that we propose is tractable, being a straightforward convex optimization problem. The use of sparse signature sequences has not received much attention, but we show in this paper that sparsity can be exploited to reduce the complexity of the precoding, as compared to MC-CDMA with full-length signature sequences. We also believe it has attractive features in terms of channel measurement, since each user only occupies a small number of subcarriers, and the chance of two (newly arriving) users having overlapping subcarriers is minimal, which aids the channel access and channel measurement process 1 . Another attractive feature of CDMA is the robustness to out- of-cell interference. To achieve the same level of robustness"
2004699,13990,8228,Interference constrained device-to-device communications,2014,"The steep growth in mobile data traffic has gained a lot of attention in recent years. With current infrastructure deployments and radio resources, operators will not be able to cope with the upcoming demands. Consequently, discussions of the next generation of mobile networks, referred to as the fifth generation (5G), have started in both academia and industry. In addition to more capacity, stringent requirements for improving energy efficiency, decreasing delays, and increasing reliability have been envisioned in 5G. Many solutions have been put forward, one of them being device-to-device (D2D) communications where users in close proximity can transmit directly to one another bypassing the base station (BS).In this thesis, we identify trade-offs and challenges of integrating D2D communications into cellular networks and propose potential solutions. To maximize gains from such integration, resource allocation and interference management are key factors. We start by introducing cooperation between D2D and cellular users in order to minimize any interference between the two user types and identifying the scenarios where this cooperation can be beneficial. It is shown that an increase in the number of cellular users within the coverage area and in the size of the cell is associated with a higher probability of cooperation. With this cooperation, we can potentially increase the number of connected devices, reduce the delay, increase the cell sum rate, and offload an overloaded cell.Next, we consider D2D communications underlaying the uplink of cellular networks. In such a scenario, any potential gain from resource sharing (time, frequency, or space) is determined by how the interference is managed. The quality and performance of the interference management techniques depend on the availability of the channel state information (CSI) and the location of nodes as well as the frequency of updates regarding such information. The more information is required, the more signaling is needed, which results in higher power consumption by the users. We investigate the trade-off between the availability of full CSI, which necessitates instantaneous information, and that of limited CSI, which requires infrequent updates. Our results show that with limited CSI, a good performance (in terms of the sum rate of both user types) can be achieved if a small performance loss is tolerated by cellular users. In addition, we propose a novel approach for interference management which only requires the information on the number of D2D users without any knowledge about their CSI. This blind approach can achieve a small outage probability with very low computational complexity when the number of scheduled D2D users is small.We then study the problem of mode selection, i.e., if a user should transmit in the D2D mode or in the conventional cellular mode. We identify the decision criteria for both overlay and underlay scenarios with two different objectives. We find out that the D2D communication is beneficial in macro cells or at cell boundaries. The area in which D2D mode is optimal varies with the objective of the network, transmit power, required quality-of-service, and the number of BS antennas.In the second part of this thesis, we study the effects of integration and coexistence of underlay D2D communications with another promising technology proposed for 5G, namely massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO). Potential benefits of both technologies are known individually, but the possibility of and performance gains from their coexistence are not adequately addressed. We evaluate the performance of this hybrid network in terms of energy efficiency and the average sum rate. Comprehensive analysis reveals that the performance highly depends on the D2D user density. We conclude that underlay D2D communications can only coexist with massive MIMO systems in the regime of low D2D user density. By introducing a high number of D2D users, gains from the massive MIMO technology degrade rapidly, and therefore in this case, the D2D communications should use the overlay approach rather than the underlay, or the network should only allow a subset of D2D transmissions to be active at a time."
1323252,13990,8228,Is backhaul becoming a bottleneck for green wireless access networks,2014,"Wireless access networks today consume 0.5 percent of the global energy. Rapidly growing demand for new services and ubiqutious connectivity, will further increase the energy consumption. This situation imposes a big challenge for mobile operators not only due to soaring cost of energy, but also increasing concern for global warming and sustainable development.This thesis focuses on the energy efficiency issue at the system level and studies how to incorporate energy-awareness into the design of future wireless access networks. The main contributions have been given in the areas of energy efficiency assessment, architectural and operational solutions, and total cost of investment analysis.The precise evaluation of energy efficiency is the first essential step to determine optimized solutions where metrics and models constitute the two key elements.We show that maximizing energy efficiency is not always equivalent to minimizing energy consumption which is one of the main reasons behind the presented contradictory and disputable conclusions in the literature. Further we indicate that in order to avoid the debatable directions, energy efficient network design problems should be formulated with well defined coverage and capacity requirements. Moreover, we propose novel backhaul power consumption models considering various technology and architectural options relevant for urban and rural environments and show that backhaul will potentially become a bottleneck in future ultra-high capacity wireless access networks.Second, we focus on clean-slate network deployment solutions satisfying different quality of service requirements in a more energy efficient manner. We identify that the ratio between idle- and transmit power dependent power consumption of a base station as well as the network capacity requirement are the two key parameters that affect the energy-optimum design.While results show that macro cellular systems are the most energy efficient solution for moderate average traffic density, Hetnet solutions prevail homogeneous deployment due to their ability to increase the capacity with a relatively lower energy consumption and thus enable significant energy savings in medium and high capacity demand regions.Moreover, we investigate the energy saving potential of short-term energy aware management approach, i.e., cell DTX, taking advantage of low resource utilization in the current networks arising from strict QoS requirements. With the help of developed novel quantitative method, we show that Cell DTX brings striking reduction in energy consumption and further savings are achievable if the networks are designed taking into account the fact that network deployment and operation are closely related.Finally, we develop a general framework for investigating the main cost elements and for evaluating the viability of energy efficient solutions.We first reveal the strong positive impact of spectrum on both energy and infrastructure cost and further indicate that applying sustainable solutions might also bring total cost reduction, but the viability highly depends on unit cost values as well as the indirect cost benefits of energy efficiency.Results obtained in this dissertation might provide guidelines for the network designers to achieve future high-capacity and sustainable wireless access networks."
1145556,13990,8228,Cost modeling of backhaul for mobile networks,2014,"“Connected society” where everything and everyone are connected at any time and on any location brings new challenges for the network operators. This leads to the need of upgrading the transport networks as the segment of Internet infrastructure connecting the fixed users and mobile base stations to the core/aggregation in order to provide high sustainable bandwidth, as well as supporting a massive number of connected devices. To do this, operators need to change the way that access networks are currently deployed. The future access network technologies will need to support very high capacity and very long distances, which are the inherited characteristics of optical transmission. Hence, optical fiber technology is recognized as the only future proof technology for broadband access.Capacity upgrade in the access networks can lead to a huge capacity demand in the backbone network. One promising solution to address this problem, is to keep the local traffic close to the end users as much as possible, and prevent unnecessary propagation of this type of traffic through the backbone. In this way, operators would be able to expand their access network without the significant capacity upgrade in the higher aggregation layers. Motivated by this need, a comprehensive evaluation of optical access networks is carried out in this thesis regarding ability of accommodating local traffic and amount of possible saving in the backbone by implementing locality awareness schemes.Meanwhile, next generation optical access (NGOA) networks have to provide high capacity at low cost while fulfilling the increasing reliability requirements of future services and customers. Therefore, finding cost-efficient and reliable alternative for future broadband access is one of the most important contributions of this thesis. We analyzed the tradeoff between the cost needed to deploy backup resources and the reliability performance improvement obtained by the proposed protection mechanism.Among different NGOA architectures, hybrid time and wavelength division multiplexing passive optical network (TWDM PON) is considered as a proper candidate providing high capacity and large coverage. Therefore, this approach is further analyzed and several tailored protection schemes with high flexibility are proposed to statisfy different requirements from the residential and business users in the same PON. The work carried out in the thesis has proved that TWDM PON can also offer high reliability performance while keeping the network expenditures at an acceptable level. Considering some other advantages such as low power consumption and high flexibility in resource allocation of this architecture, it has high potential to be the best candidate for NGOA networks. Moreover, new deployments of radio access networks supporting the increasing capacity demand of mobile users lead to the upgrade of the backhaul segment as a part of broadband access infrastructure. Hence, this thesis also contributes with a comprehensive techno-economic evaluation methodology for mobile backhaul. Several technologies are investigated in order to find the most cost-efficient solution for backhauling the high capacity mobile networks. Finally, a PON-based mobile backhaul with high capacity and low latency has been proposed for handling coordinated multipoint transmission systems in order to achieve high quality of experience for mobile users."
886896,13990,10228,Mobility management in optical mobile network,2014,"In this paper a novel mobility management scheme is proposed that is based on optical packet switching. Optical Packet based Mobility Management (OPMM) is proved to be more efficient for mobile traffic transport compared to conventional GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) regarding packet overhead, transport latency and energy consumption. Meanwhile, OPMM reduces the complexity of the mobility management procedure. The system design is validated in a simulator and the performance is compared with the standard 3GPP implementation in realistic scenarios with a reference architecture. Recent trends of mobile communications show that smartphones are continuously penetrating into our daily life and video based services are getting more and more popular. Together with the emergence of new radio access technologies such as Coordinated MultiPoint transmission (CoMP), Cloud RAN (C-RAN) and small cells, the mobile traffic will continue growing rapidly. Furthermore, new services can have much more stringent requirements for future mobile networks. E.g., cloud computing requires real-time communication and synchronization with multiple network computation entities, tactile Internet (1) requires extreme short latencies of 1ms. This pushes mobile network operators to seek for new mobile network transport solutions with much higher capacity, lower latency and at the same time lower cost and energy consumption. Packet optical networks are good candidates for a solution due to the high capacity and low energy consumption feature inherited from optical transport technology. The study in (2)(4) shows lower layer switching consumes less energy compared to higher layer switching in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Based on this, we propose an Optical Packet based Mobility Management (OPMM) scheme, which shifts the user data transport from IP layer to the optical layer. In OPMM, mobility management is performed on optical packets instead of IP packets. This means, there is no need to convert the complete optical packet into electric form, process/route it in the IP layer and convert it back to the optical packet before inserting it into the optical fiber. In turn, the energy consumption and processing delay can be reduced. There are numerous state of the art concepts on reducing the complexity of mobility management in the mobile networks. For instance, (6)(7) propose to replace the conventional cellular mobility management protocol-GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) (3) by MPLS (5) based mobility management. (8) attempts to include the mobility management information in the IPv6 header and use routing instead of GTP tunneling to support user mobility. However, we regard our work as the first attempt to treat the mobility management directly in the optical layer. This makes it possible to achieve higher transport efficiency and lower energy consumption compared to existing approaches. We have shown in (10) a packet switched optical mobile network architecture based on our OPMM concept and made some performance estimation via numerical simulations. This paper further verifies the design with an actual implementation of the OPMM protocol stack in a simulator and a detailed performance comparison with GTP in both data plane and control plane. The simulations are performed based on a reference architecture with parameters from actual optical devices and they prove that our design can greatly increase the transport efficiency of mobile traffic and is able to satisfy the requirements of future mobile communications. Moreover, the deployment considerations for OPMM are discussed. Section II describes the existing 3GPP mobility management protocol - GTP. Section III explains the detailed OPMM design and its QoS treatment in particular. Section IV describes the reference scenario and shows a numerical analysis of the gain of OPMM. The system design and performance is validated and evaluated in OMNest simulation environment in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper."
1873061,13990,8228,Mitigation of sounding pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems,2014,"Abstract —In massive multiple-input multiple-out (M-MIMO)systems, conventional sounding schemes may suffer from pilotcontamination of cell edge users or a lowered number of servicedusers in a multi-cell scenario. In this paper, we propose apartial sounding resource reuse (PSRR) method which aims toseamlessly guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of mobile usersby mitigating the pilot contamination as well as minimize thereduction in the number of serviced users. To this end, the PSRRdivides each cell area into center and edge areas, and partiallyreuses sounding resources among users in neighboring edge areas.We use a Markov chain model to analyze the performance of thePSRR. Then we evaluate the accuracy of our analysis throughsimulations, and show that the PSRR considerably improves QoSperformance over the conventional schemes. I. I NTRODUCTION Recently, massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) systems make base stations transmit downlink signalswith the use of an unlimited number of antennas, therebyperforming far better than the existing schemes [1]. In M-MIMO systems, uplink sounding techniques are commonlyadopted for downlink channel information feedback, which usethe channel reciprocity of time-division duplex (TDD) systems[2]. They show a critical impact on system performancesince the number of sounding users is directly related withthe number of serviced users in downlink, and the channelestimation error heavily affects the accuracy of a pre-codingmatrix [3]. Despite of its importance, few researchers havefocused on the design of sounding techniques to the best ofour knowledge [4].M-MIMO systems need to support very high mobility[2], incurring mobile users to pass through cell edge areasfrequently (i.e. handover) in multi-cell environments. However,the performance of cell edge users is signiﬁcantly degradeddue to pilot contamination when each cell exploits the wholesounding resources for its own users in a non-cooperativemanner [5]. To alleviate these problems, the sounding resourcereuse method can be used among adjacent cells in a coopera-tive manner. It provides high signal to interference ratio (SIR)for each cell edge user at the cost of having a reduced numberof serviced users. Thus, the development of a new soundingtechnique needs to consider the trade-off relation between pilotcontamination and reduced number of serviced users.In this paper, we propose a partial sounding resource reuse(PSRR) scheme to seamlessly guarantee the quality of service(QoS) of mobile users as many as possible. To this end, thePSRR ﬁrst divides the cell area into two different subareas,i.e., center area where users can obtain high SIRs and edgearea where users suffer from the pilot contamination problem.Accordingly it divides the whole sounding resources into twoparts for the center and edge areas, respectively. Then itallocates the center area resource in a non-cooperative mannerand the edge area resource in a cooperative manner. Wemathematically analyze QoS provisioning performance of thePSRR according to two system parameters of ratios; they arethe size ratio between center area and edge area, and the ratiobetween center area resource and edge area resource. Throughsimulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of our analysis, andshow that the PSRR improves QoS provisioning performance.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. InSection II, we discuss the system model and presents theproposed PSRR. Section III mathematically analyzes the QoSprovisioning performance of PSRR. In Section IV, we evaluatethe performance of PSRR through simulations, and conﬁrm theeffectiveness of our mathematical model and its performanceimprovement over the competitive schemes. Finally, we sum-marize the contributions of this paper and conclude our work.II. P"
1786634,13990,8228,An accurate frame error rate approximation of coded diversity systems with non-identical diversity branches,2014,"This paper presents an accurate approximation of the frame error rate (FER) of coded wireless communication systems with receiver diversity, such as single-input multiple- output (SIMO) systems with maximum ratio combining (MRC) or hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) systems with Chase combining. The signals at different diversity branches experience independent but non-identically distributed Rayleigh fading. The FER approximation is obtained with a threshold-based method. Specifically, the threshold value, which is critical to the FER approximation accuracy, is modeled as a linear function of the frame length in the log-domain, with the slope and intercept of the linear function determined by the underlying modulation and channel coding schemes. The analytical FER approximation is expressed as an explicit function of parameters related to modulation, coding, frame length, number of diversity branches, and the power distribution across the diversity branches. Such an FER approximation summarizes the complex physical layer operations into a few parameters, and it provides the para- metric flexibility that is not available in most existing FER approximations. Simulation results show that the proposed FER approximation can accurately predict the FER performance of a wide range of receiver diversity systems. I. INTRODUCTION Bit error rate (BER) and frame error rate (FER) are two important metrics used to measure the quality of service (QoS) of communication systems. BER provides a measurement of the end-to-end communication quality in the physical (PHY) layer. FER is also a PHY layer metric, but it can be used to facilitate the design across multiple protocol layers in a wireless network. For example, a frame error after PHY layer channel decoding can be detected with cyclic redundancy check (CRC) or parity check in the media access control layer (MAC), and frames with unrecoverable errors will be retransmitted if automatic repeat request (ARQ) is employed. The knowledge of the FER at the upper layers can thus greatly facilitate the design of wireless networks, especially for cross-layer designs that aim to improve the system performance by jointly optimizing the system parameters across two or more protocol layers (1) and (13). Recently there are growing interests in FER analysis for wireless communication systems due to the increasing im- portance of cross-layer designs. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain the exact analytical FER expression, especially for coded systems. Therefore almost all the works in the literature focus on the analytical approximations of the actual FER. In (3), an FER approximation is provided for systems with low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over bi- nary symmetric channel (BSC) by enumerating a large number of error patterns. A threshold-based FER approximation for a system with quasi-static Rayleigh fading is proposed in (4). The threshold-based method is developed by using an assumption that the FER in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel can be approximated by either 1 or 0 depending on whether the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is less than or greater than a waterfall threshold. The results in (4) are extended to diversity systems with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channels in (5) and to 2-hop relay networks with incremental hybrid relay selection in (6). The FER approximations in (4) - (6) are semi-analytical in that the threshold values of coded systems need to be evaluated through FER simulations in AWGN channels. None of the above FER approximations can explicitly quantify many important design parameters, such as frame length, modulation, coding, and the diversity orders, etc. In this paper, a new FER approximation is proposed for wireless communication systems with receiver diversity and independent but non-identically distributed (i.n.d.) diversity branches. Receiver diversity exists in many practical systems, such as single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems (7), multi- node relay systems (8), and hybrid ARQ systems (9), where the receiver can coherently combine multiple copies of the transmitted message. Signals at different diversity branches usually experience non-identically distributed fading due to the effects of pathloss and differences in transmission power. The statistical properties of the SNR for receiver diversity systems undergoing i.n.d. quasi-static Rayleigh fading are derived with the help of the moment generating function (MGF). The results are used to develop the FER approximation with the threshold- based method. Different from existing threshold-based methods that need to calculate a new threshold value for each frame length, the proposed FER analysis models the threshold value as a linear function of the frame length in the log-domain, with the slope and intercept of the linear function determined by the modulation and coding schemes. It is discovered that the threshold value is independent of the actual fading distributions or the number of diversity branches. Enabled by the log-domain linear threshold modelling, the new FER is expressed as an explicit function of various parameters related to modulation,"
1440531,13990,10228,Investigation of Radar Approach for Localization of Gastro Intestinal Endoscopic Capsule,2014,"Location estimation of a capsule endoscope in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a challenging task, as radio fre- quency signals encounter a high loss and highly dynamic channel propagation environment. In this paper, the possibility of using a radar system for capsule localization is investigated at frequencies of 2.4 GHz, 3.4 GHz, 4.8 GHz and 5.8 GHz respectively. Based on our theoretical analysis, the system at 2.4 GHz exhibits better performance. Therefore, in the next step a detailed analysis of the RF propagation in the human abdomen is presented with the aid of numerical simulations using Finite-Difference Time- Domain (FDTD) method. Our simulation results show that a radar system at 2.4 GHz can be considered for tracking the capsule if a high sensitivity receiver is deployed. In addition, we provide an in-depth study investigating the effect of antenna position and polarization on the received signal strength. The studies show that vertical polarization of the antenna outperforms other linear polarization because it provides better signal strength in the center of the human abdomen. Index Terms—Capsule endoscope, Channel model, Radar I. INTRODUCTION Endoscopy is a medical procedure that has been used to inspect and diagnose possible abnormalities and diseases inside the human body. This technology has been developed for examination of various parts of the body such as nose, oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, large and small intestine. Among different human organs the small intestine has its own complexities which affect the monitoring process. Therefore, applying conventional endoscopy methods is impossible for the small intestine due to its long length and complicated shape. Increasing the demand to improve diagnostic capabilities in the small intestine have resulted the development of a new type of endoscopy, known as the capsule endoscopy. Improvements in this technology can be achieved by addressing several issues such as active locomotion, high power efficiency, high data rate, high quality of images, remote powering of the capsule and accurate location of the capsule. Among these, capsule localization is a crucial parameter that needs to be precisely estimated. Colligating the received images from the capsule endoscope with the exact location information of the capsule can provide a clear view about the location of any detected abnormalities and reduce the time needed for assessing the images. It can also help to benefit from advance performance of the non-invasive surgery at the abdomen area. So far two main methods have been proposed to determine the capsule location in the digestive tract. These can be cat- egorized as electromagnetic wave and magnetic field strength based methods (1). Electromagnetic wave based localization is one of the common proposed method for the capsule localization. Various technologies such as Radio Frequency (RF), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and X-ray have been explored in several studies. None of these approaches can, however, produce the required accuracy of the order of millimeters. A magnetic localization technique for tracking the capsule in the GI-tract has been proposed in (2-4). As far as the human body has little influence on low-frequency magnetic signals, it is possible to achieve a high accurate result for the localization of the target by this method. Moreover, this technique is faster compared to other existing methods such as computed tomography (CT), ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite its high accuracy, this method cannot be practical. The main reason is that the required hardware may significantly increase the capsule size. It also requires special infrastructure, which limits its application to medical settings (2)."
1607441,13990,10228,Efficient packet recovery in wireless networks,2014,"Wireless medium access control (MAC) protocols usually provide reliability in the presence of packet errors. The efficiency of these reliability mechanisms is generally low since they require the entire packet to be retransmitted even though only parts of it may have been corrupted. To address this issue, this paper presents an efficient mechanism for the recovery of packets corrupted due to both channel errors and collisions. The proposed mechanism first determines the cause of the errors. Next, the symbols with errors are isolated by using the error vector magnitude (EVM) of received symbols as the feature for detection. Using explicit feedback about which blocks of symbols have errors, only the erroneous blocks are then retransmitted. Our results show that the proposed mechanism increases the efficiency of the MAC protocol by providing higher throughput. I. INTRODUCTION Wireless transmissions are susceptible to two sources of errors: (i) poor channel conditions due to fading, path loss and noise; (ii) collisions due to concurrent transmissions from other nodes. To provide reliability, most wireless MAC proto- cols include mechanisms to detect errors, and retransmission strategies to recover the corrupted packet. The key limitation of existing mechanisms is that when a packet is corrupted during transmission, the entire packet is retransmitted. This leads to unnecessary and costly overhead since most channel errors and collisions affect only part of the packet. To address this issue, this paper presents an efficient packet recovery mechanism for wireless networks such as IEEE 802.11 which use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as the physical layer. The most common method to detect corrupted packets is through error detection codes. Mechanisms such as automatic repeat request (ARQ) are then used to retransmit the corrupted packet (1). Most ARQ schemes provide reliability by retrans- mitting the entire corrupted packet. A scheme for marking bits that are likely in error is presented in (2) and it is shown that the throughput may be increased by retransmitting only these bits. However, this approach requires specialized hardware, and has a high overhead feedback strategy. A packet recovery mechanism that works by combining multiple copies of a packet from different access points is proposed in (3). The overhead and delay associated with combining agents limits the application of this scheme. Moreover, only AWGN channels are considered in (3) and its effectiveness in more practical channels has not been established. In (4), a software- only solution to packet recovery based on harnessing partial packets is presented. This scheme relies on incremental redun- dancy and coding schemes, which can become a bottleneck at high data rates. In contrast, the proposed packet recovery mechanism does not require any customized hardware, has lower overhead, and provides real time operation. The main contribution of this paper is a methodology that detects the symbols that were corrupted during transmission. The transmitter can then use precise retransmissions of only the corrupted symbols. The proposed methodology to localize the errors is based on calculating the EVM of the received symbol. Each received packet with errors is first classified as either a packet corrupted due to a collision or due to channel errors. Based on the cause of corruption, two slightly different methodologies are proposed to isolate the symbols with errors. The receiver then conveys the information about the corrupted symbols to the transmitter using the acknowledgment (ACK) packet. The transmitter retransmits only the corrupted sym- bols, which are then used by the receiver to reconstitute the packet. Extensive simulation results are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed packet recovery mechanism. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed packet recovery mechanism. Sections III and IV present mechanisms for detecting the cause of packet errors and localizing the errors, respectively. Section V analyses the proposed mechanism, Section VI presents simulation results, and Section VII concludes the paper. II. EFFICIENT PACKET RECOVERY MECHANISM"
1848826,13990,8228,On the Comparison of Real-Time Rate Control Schemes for H.264/AVC Video Streams over IP-Based Networks Using Network Feedbacks,2011,"Abstract —Real-time rate control techniques are necessary to applications such as video streaming in order to adapt video sending rate to network conditions so that the perceived video quality is optimised. In this paper two real- time rate control schemes, are presented. The first one uses the currently available bandwidth in order to perform rate control by selecting the optimum QP (Quantization Parameter). The second rate control scheme is based on measurements of the current packet loss in order to select the optimum QP parameter. Through extensive simulations on a test-bed environment both schemes are studied under diverse network conditions and are compared against the commonly used Rate-Distortion optimization scheme, which is embedded on a video encoder. Keywords-real time video rate control, perceived video QoS optimization, PSNR I. I NTRODUCTION Advances in video coding standards, along with rapid developments and improvements of network infrastructures, storage capacity, and computing power are enabling an increasing number of video applications. Real time video networking over IP based wired and wireless networks are constantly becoming more popular and more demanding. Unlike previous coding standards (i.e. MPEG-1/2/4), H.264/AVC (standard jointly by ITU-T and ISO [1]) offers advanced features such as variable block sizes, multi-reference frames, improved coding efficient and better quality. Video Rate control is an important element in order to adapt video to the varying network conditions across heterogeneous wireless and wire-line networks. Rate control within the H.264 codec has been studied extensively in the literature [2], [3]. Rate control algorithms can be grouped in two major categories. The first category deals with the optimisation of Rate-Distortion at the encoder [4]-[6]. The second category deals with the determination of an optimum QP by taking into account rate-distortion and frame complexity [7], [8]. Many of these algorithms do not take into account the variation of network conditions. The objective of this paper is to compare the performance two new real time video rate control schemes that achieve maximum perceived video quality based on the currently available bandwidth (BW) and the measured packet loss, respectively. Unlike the previous methods, this paper proposes a rate control method in real-time where QP is determined by taking into account the network conditions. Two algorithms are examined. In particularly, the first rate control scheme considers current available BW that is estimated based on RTCP feedback from the user terminal. An entity named Rate Control Module (RCM) resided in the video encoder is responsible for selecting a new quantization parameter (QP) that can be used by the encoder and result in a higher perceived video quality (PSNR), as compared to the current one. The second rate-control scheme takes into account the current packet loss that is measured at the user terminal and is sent as a feedback to RCM via RTCP messages, periodically. This scheme maximizes perceived video quality by selecting a new QP that reduces the sending bit rate and at the same time minimizes the current packet loss. The performance of both schemes is compared against the standard method of rate-distortion optimisation (The encoder decides by itself about the QP parameter by taking as an input the available bandwidth). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II includes an analytical description of the proposed adaptation schemes. In Section III the test-bed environment is presented and the simulation results are discussed. Finally, Section IV concludes the paper. II. R"
1377545,13990,369,Experimental Validation of the OFDM Bit Error Probability for a Moving Receive Antenna,2014,"For an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system with pilot-symbol aided channel estimation, we compare the measured bit error ratio to the theoretical bit error probabil- ity. In order to measure mobile physical systems, we utilize the Vienna Wireless Testbed which has been augmented by a rotation wheel unit. The analytical solution assumes Rayleigh fading, additive Gaussian noise, and an arbitrary linear interpolation method to estimate the unknown channel taps. Our measurements confirm our assumptions and demonstrate convincingly that our theoretical expressions accurately model the true physical behavior, even for speeds of up to 100 km/h. I. INTRODUCTION Nowadays, most wireless communication standards (DAB, LTE, WIFI 802.11) employ Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) as their modulation technique. While we have a good knowledge of what to expect in coherent transmissions over wireless channels in idealistic setups, the implications of practical systems are by far not so well understood. In particular high speed scenarios as they appear in car/train to infrastructure communications by LTE require a solid understanding of the transmission chain. Coherent trans- mission requires channel knowledge which typically comes by estimation based on training or so-called pilot symbols, i.e., known symbols at transmitter and receiver side. Pilot-symbol- Aided Channel Estimation (PACE) is usually considered in this context whereby the channel at data positions is estimated by interpolation. The optimal linear interpolation in terms of Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) was derived in (1). However, an MMSE solution requires a-priori knowledge of the channel statistics and a matrix inversion. This motivated other authors to investigate different interpolation methods e.g., spline (2), 2D Deslauriers-Dubuc (3) and 2D low-pass (4). As a comparison measure the Bit Error Ratio (BER) was obtained through Monte Carlo simulations. Such simulations require a long simulation time and do not offer analytical insights. This recently motivated us to derive an analytical Bit Error Probability (BEP) expression for arbitrary linear interpolation methods (5) which can, for example, be used to find an improved pilot pattern design or to determine the optimal trade-off between pilot and data symbol power (6). Mobile wireless communication channels are characterized by time-varying multipath propagation (7), i.e., due to multiple scatterers, the electromagnetic signal can propagate along several different paths which causes frequency-selectivity and time-selectivity. The first can be combated by inserting a cyclic prefix while the latter leads to Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI)"
1146268,13990,10228,Joint Optimization of Multi-Rate LDPC Code Ensembles for the AWGN Channel Based on Shortening and Puncturing,2014,"In most communication systems, being able to adapt the error protection strength of the physical layer is essential to ensure the functionality of the system in potentially strongly varying conditions. Traditional forward error correction code design focuses on the optimization of codes with a fixed code rate for a worst-case channel condition. So-called rate-compatible codes, on the other hand, are tailored to support multiple code rates. In this paper we present an optimization strategy for a rate-compatible system based on shortening and puncturing of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. While the technique itself is well known, we propose a novel joint optimization of the resulting multi-rate LDPC code ensemble at all rates. This joint optimization achieves close to capacity decoding thresholds over an arbitrarily wide range of target code rates using only a single encoder and decoder implementation. I. INTRODUCTION In wireless communications the physical layer has to deal with potentially rapidly varying transmission channels. More- over, the variety of supported services determines the required data rates and error protection levels. The Forward Error Cor- rection (FEC) functionality of such systems commonly allows for an adaptation to these variations in order to efficiently use the available resources as, e.g, the limited radio bandwidth. FEC codes that can achieve different protection levels and information data rates based on one fixed so-called mother code are frequently denoted rate-compatible (RC). As one of the most powerful FEC schemes, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes (1), (2) are included in many of today's communication systems. However, these standards specify separate LDPC codes for each supported code rate. This increases hardware complexity since all supported codes have to be implemented in each transmitter and receiver. Rather than using multiple codes, there exist techniques to construct RC LDPC codes of higher or lower code rates from a fixed-rate mother code. In (3), Li et al. studied parity bit puncturing to construct LDPC codes of higher code rates and proposed a special code extension to achieve lower code rates. Another approach to construct codes of lower code rates was presented in (4) using information shortening. In this paper, we present a novel joint optimization strategy for the binary input additive white Gaussian noise (BIAWGN) channel to achieve a multi-rate LDPC code ensemble with one mother code of rate rm. The resulting multi-rate ensemble supports code rates between 0 and rm by information short- ening and code rates between rm and 1 by parity puncturing in a rate-compatible way. With the proposed approach, close to capacity performance is achieved over an arbitrarily wide range of code rates. II. LOW-DENSITY PARITY-CHECK CODES A binary sparse parity check matrix H of dimension M×N defines a binary (N,K) LDPC code with N code bits and K = N M information bits. We assume H to have full rank, such that the code rate is given by r = K. The Tanner graph description of an LDPC code is convenient for describing the commonly used message-passing decoders. This graph consists of N variable nodes and M check nodes which are connected by edges according to the non-zero entries of H. Let the number of non-zero elements in a column (row) of the parity check matrix be denoted the weight of that column (row) or equivalently the degree of the corresponding variable (check) node. The distribution of the different column and row weights is commonly described by a so-called degree distribution pair in the following polynomial notation:"
942488,13990,10192,A Transport Protocol for Content-Centric Networking with Explicit Congestion Control,2014,"Content-centric networking (CCN) adopts a receiver-driven, hop-by-hop transport approach that facilitates in-network caching, which in turn leads to multiple sources and multiple paths for transferring content. In such a case, keeping a single round trip time (RTT) estimator for a multi-path flow is insufficient as each path may experience different round trip times. To solve this problem, it has been proposed to use multiple RTT estimators to predict network condition. In this paper, we examine an alternative approach to this problem, CHoPCoP, which utilizes explicit congestion control to cope with the multiple-source, multiple-path situation. Protocol design innovations of CHoPCoP include a random early marking (REM) scheme that explicitly signals network congestion, and a per-hop fair share Interest shaping algorithm (FISP) and a receiver Interest control method (RIC) that regulate the Interest rates at routers and the receiver respectively. We have implemented CHoPCoP on the ORBIT testbed and conducted experiments under various network and traffic settings. The evaluation shows that CHoPCoP is a viable approach that can effectively deal with congestion in the multipath environment. I. INTRODUCTION During the last decade, content retrieval has dominated the Internet usage. To address the challenges posed for content retrieval, content-centric networking (CCN) (12), (15) has been proposed. Being a significant shift in the network design philosophy, CCN is centered on named content instead of host addresses. Routing towards a content is based on the content name instead of the host address, and data retrieval is initiated by issuing Interest at the content receiver. Com- pared to application-layer overlay solutions such as Content Distribution Networks (CDN) and Peer-to-peer systems (P2P), CCN holds the promise of providing a more efficient and cost- effective solution to content dissemination. CCN's unique characteristics introduce new design chal- lenges for the underlying transport protocol. First, CCN is naturally receiver-driven, since the content receiver needs to issue an Interest first in order to request a Data chunk. Second, hop-by-hop transfer is desired for CCN transport, because con- tent files can be cached along the route to improve throughput. Moreover, since a specific content is often widely disseminated and cached in the network, a CCN flow may have multiple sources - i.e., one content chunk originates from source A, while the next chunk might originate from source B. Such multi-source/multi-path transfer in CCN makes congestion estimation based on a single RTT value fall short. These features of CCN are sufficiently distinct from a traditional end-to-end host-based model that a new transport approach is called for. Recently transport protocol design for CCN has received"
1814231,13990,8228,Worst Case and Expected Peak-to-Average Power Ratio for Orthonormal Systems,2011,"We present several results that show, according to several criteria, that the large peaks that occur in OFDM are common to all orthonormal systems that are uniformly bounded. In particular, worst case peak-to-average values are always at least the square-root of the number of signals, and the expected peak value of a signal always increases logarithmically with the number of signals. The same growth also occurs for single-user signals with the appropriate normalization. Further, we investigate peak-to-average power properties of the prolate spheroidal wave functions and the Walsh functions, which are used in DS-CDMA. I. INTRODUCTION Large signal peak values are one of the main drawbacks of OFDM systems and, thus, their study is currently an area of much research. In this paper we show in a number of statements that the behavior seen in the OFDM system is common to all bounded orthonormal systems. This is true of typical single-user as well as multi-carrier systems. In fact, OFDM offers ideal performance by several measures, in that its behavior achieves the best possible. This is true for the worst-case deterministic peak as well as the expected value of the peaks. We show that analogous behavior occurs for the set of prolate spheroidal wave functions and for the Walsh functions, which are the signals used in DS-CDMA. These observations are timely since it is expected that 5G wireless systems will move from strict OFDM signals to other waveforms. We begin Section II by showing that the peak-values of single-user signals can grow logarithmically with the signal length. We then give several propositions that demonstrate that all orthonormal systems can lead to peak values of at least the same order as OFDM signals. We give several variations of this result. In the OFDM case, it is well-known that expected signal peaks grow logarithmically in the number of signals. We show that a powerful result from probability in Banach spaces yields the same behavior for all uniformly bounded orthonormal systems. This shows that there does not exist another orthonormal systems that immediately has a better peak value behavior than the OFDM system. In B. Farrell was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) under Project BO 1734/18-1, and H. Boche was supported by a start-up fund of the Technische UniversitM¨ unchen. doing so, we hope to make a significant mathematical result with direct application to multi-carrier systems familiar to the communications community. In Section III we address peak value properties of the prolate spheroidal wave functions. There are two motivations for doing this. First, they are defined for long time intervals, and so it is valuable to determine if they have enough overlap among signals to lead to a high peak value. Secondly, these signals were used by Pollak, Slepian and Landau to prove Shannon's fundamental theorems of information theory. Proving that they have a strong peak growth then means that the approach taken by Pollak, Slepian and Landau would be insufficient if a peak value constraint were imposed. In Section IV we address the signals used in DS-CDMA, namely the Walsh functions. While the results of Section II apply to DS-CDMA, we show explicitly how peak values of the square-root of the number of signals can occur there. We use 'Theorem' to denote results cited from the mathematics literature and 'Lemma' or 'Proposition' for our results."
910248,13990,22021,Scrutinizing the average error probability for Nakagami fading channels,2014,"The ultimate goal of the present paper is to provide mathematical tools for dealing with the complicated average error probability (AEP) in Nakagami fading channels. This is useful for analytical investigations as well as alleviating computational ef- fort in simulations or on-line computations. We hence thoroughly analyze the mathematical structure of the AEP over Nakagami fading channels. First, the AEP is re-parameterized to obtain a mathematically concise form. The main contributions are then as follows. An ordinary differential equation is set up, which has the AEP as a solution. By this approach, a new representation of the AEP is found, which merely needs integration over a broken rational function. This paves the way to numerous amazing relations of the AEP, e.g., to the Gaussian hypergeometric and the incomplete beta function. Moreover, monotonicity and log- convexity are demonstrated. Finally, asymptotic expansions of the AEP are given. I. INTRODUCTION Understanding the stochastic nature of fast fading channels is a prerequisite to develop high performance transceivers. Additive white Gaussian noise channels are well investigated, however, practically relevant channels like Rice and Nakagami fading channels are much less understood. The main reason is that analytical expressions become mathematically intractable because highly complicated functions are involved. Hence, in simulations only numerical methods are used to optimize, analyze or verify the performance of communication links. These methods are indeed useful for many applications, but inadequate to truly understand and describe the behavior of transceivers and their performance. A prominent example is the explicit evaluation of the average error probability (AEP) when transmitting over Rice or Nakagami fading channels. A closed-form expression of the average error probability from its integral representation seems barely achievable except in some rare special cases. In this situation, mathematical approximations by simpler func- tions are of great help and fully sufficient for most practical purposes. It is the main purpose of the present paper to provide a bunch of mathematical tools for dealing with the complicated AEP in Nakagami fading channels. This is useful for analytical investigations as well as alleviating the computational effort in simulations or on-line computations. In this paper, we explore the AEP over Nakagami fading channels in detail. The present work may be seen in the same vein as the pioneering works (1)-(6) and (7). Therein the error probability and corresponding approximations in terms of special functions and finite or infinite series are investigated. In (8) characteristic functions are used to show that the average error probability analysis of different modulation formats can be unified into a single common framework. In the next section, we start with the prerequisite mathemat- ical material. Thereafter, the AEP is represented as an integral and re-parameterized to obtain a mathematically concise form. The next step consists of setting up an ordinary differential equation, which has AEP as a solution. By this approach, a convenient representation is found, which merely needs inte- gration over a broken rational function. This paves the way to numerous amazing relations of the AEP, e.g., to the Gaussian hypergeometric and the incomplete beta function. Moreover, monotonicity and log-convexity are demonstrated. Finally, asymptotic expansions of the AEP are given. In summary, a set of analytical tools is provided which supports numerical computations on one hand and allows for developing simple approximations and bounds of the error probability on the other hand."
1293435,13990,8839,SpyLoc: a light weight localization system for smartphones,2013,"In this paper, we propose and addresses the challenge of designing a light-weight high-accuracy indoor/outdoor localization system ( SpyLoc ) for off-the-shelf smartphones. In SpyLoc, we want to leverages both the acoustic interface (microphone/speaker) and the Wi-Fi interface at the kernel-level of the smartphones as well as the inertial sensors in the smartphones to achieve high localization accuracy. In the ranging-based approach, we utilizes the RF-Beep ranging scheme[?], and in dead reckoning-based approach, we fuses the inertial sensors of the smartphone to estimate the direction and the distance of user's movements. In RF-Beep [?], we develope a ranging scheme that utilizes the Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) between the acoustic and the radio-frequency (RF) signal. The RF-Beep basically leverages the slow propagation speed of the acoustic signal with respect to the RF signal to estimate the relative range. The well known acoustic range based localization scheme, Cricket [?] also utilizes the same concept of using the difference in arrival times of concurrent transmissions of radio and ultrasound signals at the target device to infer the distance. Unlike the Cricket, which was designed with special hardware, our localization scheme is applicable to the smartphones. In RF-Beep, we address the different challenges of implementing such ranging scheme in smartphones by leveraging the existing functionalities of the audio driver and the WiFi driver. Further details on RF-Beep scheme could be found in~\cite{Uddin:RF}. The ranging based localization scheme typically requires at least three reference points (e.g., anchor points), in order to calculate the location. However all these three reference points must be in Line of Sight(LoS) to the target device. In \textit{SpyLoc} localization system, we use the combination of both ranging-based and dead reckoning approaches to reduce the constraint of having three LoS anchor/reference points all the time. The basic idea of the SpyLoc is to leverage the benefits of both the dead-reckoning and the ranging scheme to build a practical localization system. Given the high errors of the inertial sensors, SpyLoc uses a novel ranging scheme based on both the acoustic and WiFi interfaces to mitigate this error in order to improve the localization accuracy. Unlike the ranging-based or RF-based localization schemes that require multiple reference points (e.g., achor points), using the dead reckoning in SpyLoc reduces the required number of reference points to only one reference to locate and track users accurately. This low dependency on ranging scheme make SpyLoc practically applicable to high mobility environment. Finally, In the SpyLoc system, user's device (i.e. smartphone) works autonomously to determine its location. This system does not require any coordination from the nearby smartphones or from a central controller. Furthermore, this localization system does not require user's device to transmit any acoustic signal or RF messages to nearby smartphones. Therefore increasing the number of user's devices have no impact on the complexity of the SpyLoc system, which make SpyLoc a light-weight localization system. In addition, such characteristics make the localization system privacy preserving and energy efficient for the user's smartphone."
2039751,13990,9015,Piggyback CrowdSensing (PCS): energy efficient crowdsourcing of mobile sensor data by exploiting smartphone app opportunities,2013,"Fueled by the widespread adoption of sensor-enabled smartphones, mobile crowdsourcing is an area of rapid innovation. Many crowd-powered sensor systems are now part of our daily life -- for example, providing highway congestion information. However, participation in these systems can easily expose users to a significant drain on already limited mobile battery resources. For instance, the energy burden of sampling certain sensors (such as WiFi or GPS) can quickly accumulate to levels users are unwilling to bear. Crowd system designers must minimize the negative energy side-effects of participation if they are to acquire and maintain large-scale user populations.   To address this challenge, we propose  Piggyback CrowdSensing  (PCS), a system for collecting mobile sensor data from smartphones that lowers the energy overhead of user participation. Our approach is to collect sensor data by exploiting  Smartphone App Opportunities  -- that is, those times when smartphone users place phone calls or use applications. In these situations, the energy needed to sense is lowered because the phone need no longer be woken from an idle sleep state just to collect data. Similar savings are also possible when the phone either performs local sensor computation or uploads the data to the cloud. To efficiently use these sporadic opportunities, PCS builds a lightweight, user-specific prediction model of smartphone app usage. PCS uses this model to drive a decision engine that lets the smartphone locally decide which app opportunities to exploit based on expected energy/quality trade-offs.   We evaluate PCS by analyzing a large-scale dataset (containing 1,320 smartphone users) and building an end-to-end crowdsourcing application that constructs an indoor WiFi localization database. Our findings show that PCS can effectively collect large-scale mobile sensor datasets (e.g., accelerometer, GPS, audio, image) from users while using less energy (up to 90% depending on the scenario) compared to a representative collection of existing approaches."
1295544,13990,369,Cooperation-Based Network Coding in Cognitive Radio Networks,2014,"We consider a scenario consisting of a primary and a secondary system, each represented by a pair of a transmitter and a receiver. The secondary transmitter assists in the retransmission of the primary message, which prevents the primary performance from being degraded by allowing the secondary system to access the transmission resources. Two network coding schemes applied in retransmission phase are investigated, the stationary network coding (SNC) scheme and the adaptive network coding (ANC) scheme. For each scheme we derive analytical results on packet throughput and infer that the ANC scheme outperforms the SNC scheme. We then provide a numerical performance comparison and a numerical optimization of the secondary packet throughput. Our main result shows cooperation can provide a significant performance improvement through effective network coding. I. INTRODUCTION Cooperation among nodes in a cognitive radio network is often applied due to the inherent ability of intelligently collect- ing and utilizing information (1), (2). Relaying (3) in particular is commonly used. Typically the secondary system may be allowed to access the primary spectrum, operating as a relay for the primary system in return for obtaining transmission opportunities. In this paper, we consider secondary cooperative relaying through network coding. Network coding is widely used to improve network throughput, efficiency and scalability. Instead of simply relaying the packets of information, inter- mediate nodes combine several packets for transmission. Here, we focus on delay-insensitive data services, where Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) is applied for packet error recovery. ARQ enables the application of network coding in broadcast and multicast networks. Network coding schemes on broadcast channel are proposed in (4), where the sender combines and retransmits the lost packets within one transmission and multiple receivers are able to recover their lost packets. In (5), a relay assisted multicast is studied, where the relay node broadcasts the packets through network coding to all receivers. Birk and Kol proposed network coding in multiple- unicast networks (6), (7) for efficiently supplying nonidentical data from a central server to multiple caching clients. We advance this view by establishing a cognitive radio network with network coding applied at the secondary transmitter over a broadcast channel to both primary and secondary receivers. In our work, two network coding schemes are investigated for use in the retransmission phase, and the performance is"
1784807,13990,8839,"Three theories for delays, clocks and security in wireless networks",2012,"We propose three theories, which can be regarded as attempts to characterize and establish guaranteed properties of wireless networks: (i) How and to what extent can we deliver packets with hard delay bounds? (ii) How and to what extent can we synchronize clocks in wireless networks? (iii) Can we develop provably secure protocols for the entire life-cycle of wireless networks that also optimize a utility measure while operating in a hostile environment? For the first problem, consider an access point serving several clients over unreliable wireless links. Suppose packets arrive for/from the clients, with each packet having a hard deadline, after which it is dropped. We characterize precisely the mix of delivery ratios, channel unreliabilities and hard deadline that the access point can guarantee, under some models. For the second problem, consider a wireless network where clocks at the nodes are linear, though with different rates (skews) and offsets. Nodes can exchange packets with their neighbors, with direction dependent delays. We characterize precisely to what extent clocks can and cannot be synchronized and delays determined. Under a random model the end-to-end error can be kept bounded irrespective of network size. Concerning the third problem, traditionally, wireless protocols have been developed to provide performance. As attacks are identified, the protocols are fortified against the identified vulnerabilities. However, holistic guarantees are not provided against other attacks. We seek to reverse this paradigm. We propose a provable approach that guarantees the protocol suite is secure when the nodes are subject to certain assumptions. The protocols take a set of good nodes mingled with unknown malicious nodes from primordial birth to an operating network, while attaining min-max of a utility function. The maximization is over protocols announced and followed by the good nodes, and the minimization is over all behaviors of the malicious nodes. Further, the malicious nodes are reduced to either cooperating or jamming. [Joint work with Vivek Borkar, Nikolaos Freris, Scott Graham, I-Hong Hou, Yih-Chun Hu, Jonathan Ponniah and Roberto Solis]."
1873793,13990,369,Media Independent Handover Management in Heterogeneous Access Networks - An Empirical Evaluation,2011,"The constant evolution on the telecommunications sector particularly with the increasing development of wireless technologies has led to the diversification of access networks solutions. Nowadays technologies like Wi-Fi, WiMAX, UMTS and LTE are a set of heterogeneous networks that provide mobile broadband access to multiple devices, from smartphones to laptops or tablets. This diversification alongside with the appearance of multi-technology terminals and user ubiquitous access requirements, brought enormous challenges to mobility management in heterogeneous network environments. To address this issue the IEEE group has been working on a standard in order to optimize mobility procedures through different access technologies, the IEEE802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) Services. The goal of this standard is to support and improve handovers regardless the access technology used by defining an abstraction layer called Media Independent Handover Function (MIHF) between Layer 3 and Layer 2 and below (MAC and PHY). This paper focuses on the performance of this framework by presenting an Enhanced Mobility Manager (EMM) entity capable of performing terminal and handover management using this framework. The EMM was deployed and tested in a real heterogeneous network environment providing Wi-Fi, WiMAX and HSPA networks access with IPv6 and MIPv6 support. To evaluate a real usage scenario a Android mobile device was used. The results show that IEEE 802.21 framework meets the proposed objectives by enabling both seamless handover between different Radio Access Technologies and QoS provisioning. This paper is organized as follows: Section II presents related work regarding the IEEE802.21 and mobility management developments, Section III briefly introduces the IEEE802.21 framework and its main goals. Section IV describes the proposed mobility management entity and how it can be integrated with the IEEE802.21 framework in order to control and execute handover procedures. Section V describes how the EMM was developed, how it works and presents the implemented testbed details. In Section VI the methodology used to perform the performance evaluation is presented and results are presented and discussed. Finally, Section VII presents the conclusions and future work possibilities."
2123366,13990,20896,Logic-Based Programming for Wireless Sensor-Activator Networks,2011,"In this paper we present SAN-Logic, a lightweight logic-based programming paradigm that enables the dynamic progammability and configuration of sensor-actuator interactions in wireless sensor networks used to support Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Our goal is to simplify complex CPS design by providing a structured model of interactions that can be automatically mapped and deployed to a sensor-actuator network in an efficient and scalable manner. In contrast to sensor networking paradigms that distribute an application into individual sub-programs, SAN-Logic models the system as a set of boolean expressions which can be partitioned across the network like gates in a circuit. The user defines interactions as timed asynchronous sequential logic expressions [1] with sensors and actuators representing the inputs and outputs of the system. This approach is highly scalable since once deployed each interaction takes place as a sequence of independent and asynchronous events. This allows SAN-Logic to operate in a fully distributed manner without a central authority. Using this framework, optimization takes place across multiple tasks enabling sharing of resources within the network which will be an important part of future CPS. Redundant routes and the stateless nature of combinational logic (along with periodic state update messages) allow the system to easily cope with packet-loss and failed nodes. A major benefit of this approach is the ability to leverage existing hardware design and synthesis tools used by the VLSI design community. We demonstrate how boolean manipulation of the logic can be used to alter the mapping of expressions onto the network and hence can be used for optimization and verification. We provide an approach using logic simplification and mapping that reduces message passing by factoring common terms across different data paths within tasks and placing intermediate terms such that they benefit from shorter paths. In complex systems, we see on average a 40% reduction in message passing as compared to an implementation that does not optimize communication patterns within and across tasks."
1445206,13990,8839,The future of mobile computing,2014,"Jeff Gehlhaar, VP of Technology for Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. will discuss the future of mobile computing which will entail a much more personalized user experience.   As the world continues to shift towards a more connected world, people are using their mobile devices in new ways and having higher expectations of what they can do with those devices. This is leading to the next frontier of mobile being much more personalized with mobile devices becoming extensions of the user, understanding where you are, where you've been and what you want to do or act on next. This is also resulting in services and applications that have traditionally been delivered via the cloud, migrating to mobile which present unique challenges and opportunities in mobile.   In this talk we will explore the new and exciting technologies that Qualcomm Research is working on to advance the frontier in personalized devices and help solve some of these challenges. Starting with always on sensor processing that make basic predictions about where you are and what actions you are performing, to research in brain inspired computing and embedded cognition, Qualcomm is working to make devices which are always with you, smarter and truly personal.   To further this vision of transforming the future of mobile computing, Qualcomm Research has also been working in the area of brain inspired computation and neural networks for a number of years. Early work has focused on biologically inspired approaches, involving spiking neural networks and understanding the complex behaviors of the brain. Recent advances in the industry around deep neural networks have resulted in state-of-the-art performance in machine learning pattern matching tasks. As mobile SOCs continue to gain significant computational power, bringing applications powered by deep learning to mobile devices is becoming possible. We will explore the near term opportunities like object recognition, scene classification, applications for smarter mobile cameras, automotive, and robotics. We will also look at other aspects of brain inspired computing including the potential of a new kind of low power hardware.

2353519,13990,8839,MOTA: engineering an operator agnostic mobile service,2011,"There are two emerging trends in the mobile data world. First, mobile data is exploding at a rapid rate with analysts predicting 25-50X growth by the year 2015. The second trend is that users are demanding greater degree of flexibility in selecting their operators at fine timescales. Across Asia, dual-SIM phones have become popular, while Apple is rumored to be designing a  Universal SIM  that will allow iPhone users to toggle between different operators. This latter trend points towards an impending disruption in wireless service models which could also be the need of the hour from the spectrum shortage perspective.   This points towards a new service model where users can choose an operator based on application needs. However, if users make this choice greedily without network assistance, it can exacerbate spectrum scarcity and degrade user experience. In this work, we consider user devices with multiple network interfaces (3G, LTE etc.) that can be simultaneously active and each running multiple applications. We propose the MOTA service model to enable users to associate each interface with the operator of choice at fine time scales. Under the MOTA service model, through concise signalling information, operators provide information about their own network, so that each user can (i) choose a suitable operator for each interface, and (ii) choose an interface for each active application. We make the following contributions in this paper. First, we propose concise network signalling that assists users to make informed choices even under mobility. Second, we develop user-choice algorithms that maximize a suitable notion of user satisfaction while using spectrum resources efficiently. Third, we perform extensive evaluation over actual base station deployment in a city coupled with real signal propagation maps. Our results with two operators show that, MOTA service model provides capacity gain in the range 2.5-4X over the current existing service model. Finally, we argue that our solution is practically implementable by combining appropriate IEEE standards and IETF proposals."
1015998,13990,10228,Joint resource optimization for OFDMA cellular networks with user cooperation and QoS provisioning,2014,"In this paper, a joint resource optimization scheme is designed for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular wireless networks with multi-user cooperation. Joint relay selection, subcarrier allocation and pairing and power allocation algorithms are developed with the objective of maximizing the total capacity of the system considering the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the users. The optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is often very difficult to solve in its original form. We provide a novel optimization framework to solve such non-linear optimization problems. The joint relay selection and subcarrier allocation problem is modified to a linear assignment problem and an efficient algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal assignment solution based on the Hungarian method. We propose computationally efficient solution to the joint resource optimization problem via dual decomposition method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. With the booming of the number of mobile users and appli- cations, the demand for higher data rate is rising exponentially. The question is how to meet the increasing demand with the limited resources, once the network has been established. The best solution is to develop resource optimization schemes, which can guarantee to meet certain demand and enhance the performance of the network further. Optimal resource allocation for multi user cooperative OFDMA systems is in general very difficult to solve in its original form. There are several works on resource allocation for cooperative OFDMA systems with fixed relays. Although the power and subcarrier allocation schemes are developed in (5), it is assumed that the users are assigned to the fixed relays in advance without considering QoS provisioning. To solve the resource allocation problem in (4), subcarrier pairing is ignored and hence the solution is suboptimal. In (6), power and subcarrier allocation and subcarrier pairing policies are designed for fixed relay stations. Most of the existing works in resource allocation for OFDMA relaying systems consider fixed relays and the solution is not cost effective. Therefore, the performance of the system can be further improved in terms of system capacity, cost and QoS provisioning to the users. In this paper, we focus on capacity maximization for multi user downlink OFDMA cellular wireless networks with user cooperation. We propose a scheme that jointly optimizes the power and subcarrier allocation and relay selection considering QoS provisioning to users. The optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is in general very difficult to solve. We first modify the joint relay selection and subcarrier allocation problem to a linear assignment problem and then develop an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal solution based on the Hungarian method. We propose computationally efficient solution to the joint resource optimization problem via dual decomposition method. Our proposed scheme is more effective in comparison to the other existing schemes in the literature."
2319670,13990,10192,Using Reconfigurable Devices to Maximize Spectral Efficiency in Future Heterogeneous Wireless Systems,2011,"As broadband data further blends with cellular voice, mobile devices will become the dominant portals to the connected world. However current design practices still involve building independent networks that each make their own resource decisions. In spite of the tremendous amount of related research in this area, there are still several elemental questions that must be addressed. First, is it better to treat wireless systems as independent access networks requiring the user to handle aspects of roaming between disparate wireless networks or is an internet model better where independent autonomous wireless systems (AWS) cooperate to form a single, unified cloud to users, with network level resource allocation? Second, is it better to have dedicated, low power circuitry that supports a limited set of independent wireless Radio Access technologies (RATs) or is it better to build agile handsets that adapt (reconfigure) in real-time to operate over a large range of RAT technologies and operating modes? The results in this paper shed light on these questions. We present preliminary results from a MATLAB-based simulation study that highlights the increase in spectral efficiency as the modality of devices increase. Our analysis takes into account the cost of radio reconfiguration in terms of the temporary communications downtime and the surge of power that occurs with each reconfiguration operation. Our main result suggests that nomadic users benefit the most primarily due to their ability to route traffic over 'hotspot' type of RATs that tend to have high data rates at reduced coverage, and that this in turn helps increase the 3G or 4G bandwidth available to mobile users. All nodes in the system experience an increase in spectral efficiency ranging from 14% to 75% when compared to a similar scenario that assumes no network cooperation and static radios."
980014,13990,9015,Automated metadata transformation for a-priori deployed sensor networks,2014,"Sensor network research has facilitated advancements in various domains, such as industrial monitoring, environmental sensing, etc., and research challenges have shifted from creating infrastructure to utilizing it. Extracting meaningful information from sensor data, or control applications using the data, depends on the metadata available to interpret it, whether provided by novel networks or legacy instrumentation. Commercial buildings provide a valuable setting for investigating automated metadata acquisition and augmentation, as they typically comprise large sensor networks, but have limited, obscure metadata that are often meaningful only to the facility managers. Moreover, this primitive metadata is imprecise and varies across vendors and deployments.   This state-of-the-art is a fundamental barrier to scaling analytics or intelligent control across the building stock, as even the basic steps involve labor intensive manual efforts by highly trained consultants. Writing building applications on its sensor network remains largely intractable as it involves extensive help from an expert in each building's design and operation to identify the sensors of interest and create the associated metadata. This process is repeated for each application development in a particular building, and across different buildings. This results in customized building-specific application queries which are not portable or scalable across buildings.   We present a synthesis technique that learns how to transform a building's primitive sensor metadata to a common namespace by using a small number of examples from an expert, such as the building manager. Once the transformation rules are learned for one building, it can be applied across buildings with a similar primitive metadata structure. This common and understandable namespace captures the  semantic  relationship between sensors, enabling analytics applications that do not require apriori building-specific knowledge.   Initial results show that learning the rules to transform 70% of the primitive metadata of two buildings (with completely different metadata structure), comprising 1600 and 2600 sensors, into a common namespace ([1]) took only 21 and 27 examples respectively(Figure 1c). The learned rules were able to transform similar primitive metadata in other buildings as well(Figure 1d), enabling writing of portable applications across these buildings. The techniques developed here may be applicable to the other large legacy sensor networks, such as industrial processing, or urban monitoring."
1019596,13990,9015,Indoor pseudo-ranging of mobile devices using ultrasonic chirps,2012,"In this paper, we present an indoor ultrasonic location tracking system that can utilize off-the-shelf audio speakers (potentially already in place) to provide fine-grained indoor position data to modern mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. We design and evaluate a communication primitive based on rate-adaptive wide-band linear frequency modulated chirp pulses that utilizes the audio bandwidth just above the human hearing frequency range where mobile devices are still sensitive. Typically transmitting data, even outside of this range, introduces broadband human audible noises (clicks) due to the non-ideal impulse response of speakers. Unlike existing audio modulation schemes, our scheme is optimized based on psychoacoustic properties. For example, all tones exhibit slowly changing power-levels and gradual frequency changes so as to minimize human perceivable artifacts. Chirps also bring the benefit of Pulse Compression, which greatly improves ranging resolution and makes them resilient to both Doppler shifts as well as multi-path propagation that typically plague indoor environments. The scheme also supports the decoding of multiple unique identifier packets being transmitted simultaneously. By applying a Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) pseudo-ranging technique the mobile devices can localize themselves without tight out-of-band synchronization with the broadcasting infrastructure. This design is not only scalable with respect to the number of transmitters and tracked devices, but also improves user privacy since the mobile devices compute their positions locally. We show through user studies and experimentation on smartphones that we are able to provide sub-meter (95%  cm ) accurate indoor positioning in a manner that is imperceptible to humans."
1679772,13990,208,"Joint Admission Control, Channel Assignment and QoS Routing for Coverage Optimization in Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Cellular Networks",2011,"In recent years, cognitive radio technology (CR) has been proposed to allow unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to opportunistically access the channels unused by primary users. As a result, there is a lot of recent interests on studying cognitive radio cellular networks (CogCells) that can support both PUs and SUs. Due to the limited transmission range of SUs, in this work we consider supporting Multi-hop infrastructure-based secondary systems (SSs), where SUs can communicate with the BS over multiple hops. The use of SSs improves the reliability and coverage compared to its single-hop counterpart. In addition, SUs are allowed to access multiple channels, which helps to increase transmission reliability and coverage and relieve interference at PUs. To enable multi-hop secondary transmissions, it is also important to support efficient routing. In CogCells, efficient admission control, channel assignment and routing is crucial for the coverage optimization of SSs and to ensure the QoS requirements in CogCells. In this paper, we mathematically formulate the problem of joint admission control, channel assignment and QoS routing to maximize the coverage of SUs in a CogCell system that supports multi-hop secondary transmissions, taking into account the interference constraints and QoS requirements from the PUs and admitted SUs. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to optimize the coverage of SUs in multi-hop CogCells with the concurrent support of the above three important procedures. We show that the problem is NP-hard and propose three different algorithms to solve the coverage optimization problem and give the theoretical analyses of its performances in terms of approximation ratio to the optimum. Our solutions include a greedy heuristic approximation scheme, an algorithm that can provide exact solution, and a new approximation solution with a poly-logarithmic approximation ratio guarantee, e.g., the performance of our algorithm is within a poly-logarithmic factor of that of any optimal algorithm for the problem. Our preliminary simulation results indicate that our new approximation algorithms can effectively exploit the increased number of SUs and channels, and performs much better than the theoretical worst case bound."
1083051,13990,8228,Speeding up the transition to collective awareness,2013,"This positional paper gives an overview of some critical issues concerning collective awareness platforms. It shows how collective awareness could reconcile asymmetric and conflicting relationships to pursue the improvement of structures within society. It also shows the opportunity for public administrations and policy makers to create conditions for collective participation. Collective intelligence can be used as process to pursue the improvement of society based on the collective efforts of individuals. This could be assimilated to a process of social eudamonia, an improvement of the self and of society through awareness and understanding. However, things are not so simple and internal tensions could lead to divergent outcomes. While society is increasingly fragmented and polarised, the power over information seems to concentrate in the hands of few service providers, fiercely competing for market shares and user-generated data, thanks to laws and structures built for a competition driven society. By contrast, there is a growing demand for sharing data, access to information and for the empowerment of individuals and communities. Prosperity, sustainability, equality and collaboration are acquiring new meaning. In response to this demand, many Internet based platforms have been created, governments in Europe have started pursuing open access policies and companies are adopting mixed business models in order to acquire a larger share of data and users. Individuals, companies, governments pursue different objectives using a mix of communication and collaborative tools allowing users to play a pivotal role in the production and management of information, creating the foundation for new horizontal modes of communication and decision making. In order to exemplify pathways to collective awareness to build a society that fosters eudemonia, the paper proposes two examples: 1) social media learning and 2) the governance of health delivery services through social media. The paper concludes identifying five major challenges to help speeding the transition towards Collective Awareness."
2147101,13990,22260,Localizing Multiple Objects in an RF-based Dynamic Environment,2012,"Radio Frequency (RF) based technologies play an important role in indoor localization, since Radio Signal Strength (RSS) is easily achieved by various wireless devices without additional cost. Among these, radio map based technologies (also referred as fingerprinting technologies) are attractive. They are able to accurately localize the targets without introducing many reference nodes. Therefore, their hardware cost is low. However, this technology has two fatal limitations. First, it is hard to localize multiple objects, since radio map has to collect all the RSS information when targets are at different possible positions. But due to the multipath phenomenon, different number of target nodes at different positions often generates different multipath signals. So when the target object number is unknown, constructing a radio map of multiple objects is almost impossible. Second, environment changes will generate different multipath signals and severely disturb the RSS measurement, making laborious retraining inevitable. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Line-Of-Sight (LOS) map matching. It leverages frequency diversity of wireless nodes to eliminate the multipath behavior, making RSS more reliable than before. These reliable RSS signals are able to construct the radio map, which only reserves the LOS signal among nodes. We call it LOS radio map. The number of objects and environment changes will not affect the LOS signal between the targets and reference nodes. Such map is able to be constructed easily and require no training if reference nodes are carefully redeployed. Our basic idea is to utilize the frequency diversity of each wireless node to transmit data in different spectrum channel. Then it solves the optimization problem to get the LOS signal. Our experiments are based on TelosB sensor platform with three reference nodes. It shows that the accuracy will not decrease when localizing multiple targets in a dynamic environment. It outperforms the traditional methods by about60%. More importantly, no calibration is required in such environment. Furthermore, our approach presents attractive flexibility, making it more appropriate for general RF-based localization studies than just the radio map based localization."
1839185,13990,8228,Non-Weighted Interface Specific Routing for Load-Balanced Fast Local Protection in IP Networks,2011,"As a failure occurs, the affected traffic is quickly rerouted to backup paths for a network performing a fast protection scheme. Such a prompt reaction is aimed to reduce the damages caused by a failure. However, in some cases, the rerouted traffic may cause congestion along the backup paths which would lead to more packet losses than purely discarded affected flows. In this paper, we propose a load-balanced fast local protection scheme called Non-Weighted Interface Specific Routing (NISR) for determining the working and backup routing tables of IP routers. We jointly consider protection switching time, network survivability, and traffic load distribution together in the proposed scheme. In NISR, once a failure occurs, only the nodes adjacent to a failure divert affected traffic to backup paths. This local reaction process guarantees fast protection switching and reduces failure recovery time. Unlike the conventional IP routing, our approach relaxes the shortest path routing in computing working and backup routing tables. Most importantly, each interface in a router has its own routing tables. Combining the interface specific routing with the shortest path relaxation provides greater routing flexibility to enhance network survivability and load balancing. We formulate this as a mixed integer programming problem in which the traffic load on the most congested link is to be minimized. Since this problem is intractable by its NP-hard nature, we further decompose it into several sub-problems which are solved optimally and their solutions combined to provide a solution to the original problem. We perform experiments on some benchmark networks and compare the proposed scheme to several well-known schemes (including LFA, ECMP, OSPF, and NLB) on survivability ratio, link load distribution, and average path length for both normal and failure states. Through numerical results, we delineate that the proposed scheme achieves a sub-optimal solution, which is better for its high survivability and load balancing at the expense of slightly raising the average path hop count."
1457991,13990,369,Vehicle-to-Vehicle Real-Time Relative Positioning Using 5.9 GHz DSRC Media,2013,"Vehicular accidents are one of the deadliest safety hazards and accordingly an immense concern of individuals and governments. Although, a wide range of active autonomous safety systems, such as advanced driving assistance and lane keeping support, are introduced to facilitate safer driving experience, these stand-alone systems have limited capabilities in providing safety. Therefore, cooperative vehicular systems were proposed to fulfill more safety requirements. Most of cooperative vehicle-to-vehicle safety applications require relative positioning accuracy of decimeter with an update rate of at least 10 Hz. These requirements cannot be met via direct navigation or differential positioning techniques. This paper studies a cooperative vehicle platform that aims to facilitate real-time relative positioning (RRP) among adjacent vehicles. The developed system is capable of exchanging both GPS position solutions and raw observations using RTCM-104 format over vehicular dedicated short range communication (DSRC) links. Real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning technique is integrated into the system to enable RRP to be served as an embedded real-time warning system. The 5.9 GHz DSRC technology is adopted as the communication channel among road-side units (RSUs) and on-board units (OBUs) to distribute GPS corrections data received from a nearby reference station via the Internet using cellular technologies, by means of RSUs, as well as to exchange the vehicular real-time GPS raw observation data. Ultimately, each receiving vehicle calculates relative positions of its neighbors to attain a RRP map. A series of real-world data collection experiments was conducted to explore the synergies of both DSRC and positioning systems. The results demonstrate a significant enhancement in precision and availability of relative positioning at mobile vehicles."
1492599,13990,9015,Aveksha: a hardware-software approach for non-intrusive tracing and profiling of wireless embedded systems,2011,"It is important to get an idea of the events occurring in an embedded wireless node when it is deployed in the field, away from the convenience of an interactive debugger. Such visibility can be useful for post-deployment testing, replay-based debugging, and for performance and energy profiling of various software components. Prior software-based solutions to address this problem have incurred high execution overhead and intrusiveness. The intrusiveness changes the intrinsic timing behavior of the application, thereby reducing the fidelity of the collected profile. Prior hardware-based solutions have involved the use of dedicated ASICs or other tightly coupled changes to the embedded node's processor, which significantly limits their applicability.   In this paper, we present Aveksha, a hardware-software approach for achieving the above goals in a non-intrusive manner. Our approach is based on the key insight that most embedded processors have an on-chip debug module (which has traditionally been used for interactive debugging) that provides significant visibility into the internal state of the processor. We design a debug board that interfaces with the on-chip debug module of an embedded node's processor through the JTAG port and provides three modes of event logging and tracing: breakpoint, watchpoint, and program counter polling. Using expressive triggers that the on-chip debug module supports, Aveksha can watch for, and record, a variety of programmable events of interest. A key feature of Aveksha is that the target processor does not have to be stopped during event logging (in the last two of the three modes), subject to a limit on the rate at which logged events occur. Aveksha also performs power monitoring of the embedded wireless node and, importantly, enables power consumption data to be correlated to events of interest.   Aveksha is an operating system-agnostic solution. We demonstrate its functionality and performance using three applications running on Telos motes; two in TinyOS and one in Contiki. We show that Aveksha can trace tasks and other generic events at the function and task-level granularity. We also describe how we used Aveksha to find a subtle bug in the TinyOS low power listening protocol."
1228748,13990,8228,Power-efficient downlink communication using large antenna arrays: The doughnut channel,2012,"Large antenna arrays at the base station can facilitate power efficient single user downlink communication due to the inherent array power gain, i.e., under an average only total transmit power constraint, for a fixed desired information rate, the required total transmit power can be reduced by increasing the number of base station antennas (e.g. with i.i.d. fading, the required total transmit power can be reduced by roughly 3 dB with every doubling in the number of base station antennas, i.e., an O(N) array power gain can be achieved with N antennas). However, in practice, building power efficient large antenna arrays would require power efficient amplifiers/analog RF components. With current technology, highly linear power amplifiers generally have low power efficiency, and therefore linearity constraints on power amplifiers must be relaxed. Under such relaxed linearity constraints, the transmit signal that suffers the least distortion is a signal with constant envelope (CE). In this paper, we consider a single user Gaussian multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink channel where the signal transmitted from each antenna is constrained to have a constant envelope (i.e., for every channel-use the amplitude of the signal transmitted from each antenna is constant, irrespective of the channel realization). We show that under such a per-antenna CE constraint, the complex noise-free received signal lies in the interior of a “doughnut” shaped region in the complex plane. The per-antenna CE constrained MISO channel is therefore equivalent to a doughnut channel, i.e., a single-input single-output (SISO) AWGN channel where the channel input is constrained to lie inside a “doughnut” shaped region. Using this equivalence, we analytically compute a closed-form expression for an achievable information rate under the per-antenna CE constraint. We then show that, for a broad class of fading channels (i.i.d. and direct-line-of-sight (DLOS)), even under the more stringent per-antenna CE constraint (compared to the average only total power constraint), an O(N) array power gain can still be achieved with N base station antennas. We also show that with N ≫1, compared to the average only total transmit power constrained channel, the extra total transmit power required under the per-antenna CE constraint, to achieve a desired information rate is small and bounded for a broad class of fading channels (i.i.d. and DLOS). We also propose novel CE precoding algorithms. The analysis and algorithms presented are general and therefore applicable to conventional systems with a small number of antennas. Analytical results are supported with numerical results for the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel."
1040323,13990,8228,Epidemic forwarding in mobile social networks,2012,"Recent years have witnessed the prosperity of mobile social networks, where various information is shared among mobile users through their opportunistic contacts. To investigate efficiency of information dissemination in wireless networks, epidemic models have been employed to study message forwarding delays, presuming message delivery whenever an opportunistic contact occurs. A practical concern is typically neglected, that one mobile user may only be willing to pass information onto others with social ties, rather than anyone upon contact. Under such a constraint, information dissemination may behave differently, according to the pattern of social ties that exist in the network. In this paper, we model social-aware epidemic forwarding in mobile social networks using mean-field equations, and carefully study the end-to-end unicast message propagation delays under different levels of social ties among users. Both cases of limited and unlimited message validity are considered in our models, i.e., whether relay nodes may delete a message after carrying it for some finite time T or never. Through careful theoretical analysis and empirical studies, we made a number of intriguing observations: First, the topology of social relation graphs significantly influences message forwarding delays, i.e., the more skewed the social relationship distribution is, the larger delay it results in. Second, the average delivery delay remains fairly stable with the growth of system scale, presenting a sharp contrast with the case without social awareness. Third, we observe that with a moderate choice of T, message delivery can achieve a successful ratio of almost 100% with an expected delay very close to the case of unlimited validity, signifying that a good tradeoff can be achieved between end-to-end message delivery efficiency and energy/storage overhead at the relay nodes in a network. All these provide useful guidance for efficient information dissemination protocol design in practical mobile social networks."
1586813,13990,369,Aggregate Interference Analysis for Interweave Cognitive Networks,2014,"This paper investigates the aggregate interference from interweave cognitive secondary nodes spatially distributed in a finite Poisson field. These secondary nodes sense an out- of-band beacon to initiate their transmissions, which can be concurrent with those of the primary system if a sensing error is made. The resulting aggregate interference is analyzed in this paper. For this purpose, general Nakagami-m fading and path-loss are assumed for all relevant channels. Moreover, we incorporate random secondary node transmit powers with any probability distribution. The analysis includes the exact moment generating function (MGF) of the aggregate interference along with the exact outage probability of the primary system. Furthermore, we develop a simple MGF approximation which is valid for severely fading channels and for lower beacon reception threshold to beacon transmit power ratios. Finally, we show that a lower fading severity significantly improves the diversity order of the PR due to more accurate spectrum sensing by the secondary nodes. I. INTRODUCTION Secondary nodes of interweave cognitive radio (CR) net- works sense unused frequency chunks (1) by processing a bea- con signal (pilot channel) transmitted from either the primary transmitter or the primary receiver (PR) (2). If the beacon is detected, the secondary nodes will cease transmission within that particular frequency slot. If not, they are allowed to use it. Consequently, if secondary nodes misdetect the beacon signal, their concurrent transmissions with those of the primary system interfere with and degrade the performance of the PR. Beacon misdetection may be caused by wireless signals undergoing path-loss, fading, and shadowing. The aggregate interference due to beacon misdetection also depends on the random secondary node distribution (numbers and locations). Statistical characterization of the aggregate interference helps in the design of system parameters (suitable node densities, ge- ographical areas for deployment etc.), power control schemes, and sensing schemes in practical CR standards such as IEEE 802.22 (3). To this end, this paper analyzes the aggregate interference, and PR performance for interweave CR networks. A. Previous Research"
1191776,13990,23836,CFD Builder: A Library Builder for Computational Fluid Dynamics,2014,"Computational Fluid Dynamics is an important area in scientific computing. The weak scaling of codes is well understood with about two decades of experiences using MPI. As a result, per-node performance has become very crucial to the overall machine performance. However, despite the use of multi-threading, obtaining good performance at each core is still extremely challenging. The challenges are primarily due to memory bandwidth limitations and difficulties in using short SIMD engines effectively. This work is about the techniques and a tool to improve in-core performance. Fundamental to the strategy is a hierarchical data layout made of small cubical structures of the problem states that can fit well in the cache hierarchy. The difficulties in computing the spatial derivatives (also called near neighbor computation in the literature) in a hierarchical data layout are well known, hence, such a data layout has rarely been used in finite difference codes. This work discusses how to program relatively easily for such a hierarchical data layout, the inefficiencies in this programming strategy, and how to overcome the inefficiencies. The key technique to eliminate the overheads is called pipeline-for-reuse. It is followed by a storage optimization called maximal array contraction. Both pipeline-for-reuse and maximal array contraction are highly tedious and error-prone. Therefore, we built a source-to-source translator called CFD Builder to automate the transformations using directives. The directive based approach leverages domain experts' knowledge about the code, and eliminates the need for complex analysis before program transformations. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach using three different applications on two different architectures and two different compilers. We see up to 6.92 performance improvement using such an approach. We believe such an approach could enable library and application writers to build efficient CFD libraries."
766964,13990,21855,Hybrid visible light communication for cameras and low-power embedded devices,2014,"Visible light communication (VLC) between LED light bulbs and smart-phone cameras has already begun to gain traction for identification and indoor localization applications. To support detection by cameras, the frequencies and data rates are typically limited to below 1kHz and tens of bytes per second (Bps). In this paper, we present a technique for transmitting data from solid-state luminaries, used for interior ambient lighting, simultaneously to both cameras and low-power embedded devices in a manner that is imperceptible to occupants. This allows the camera communication VLC channel to also act as a higher speed downstream link and low-power wakeup mechanism for energy-constrained devices. Our approach uses Manchester encoding and Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK) to modulate the high-speed data stream and applies duty-cycle adjustment to generate the slower camera communication signal. We explore the trade-off between the performance of the two communication channels. Our hybrid communication protocol is also compatible with existing IR receivers. This allows lights to communicate with low-cost commodity chipsets and control home appliances such as TVs, AV receivers, AC window units, etc. We show that we are able to reliably simultaneously transmit low-speed data at 1.3 Bps to camera enabled devices and higher-speed data at 104 Bps to low-power embedded devices. Since the majority of energy in many RF communication protocols often goes towards media access and receiving, VLC-triggered wakeup can significantly decrease system energy consumption. We also demonstrate a proof-of-concept wakeup circuit that consumes less then 204 uA  and can be triggered in less then 10ms."
1573169,13990,9704,An approach based on fuzzy inference system and ant colony optimization for improving the performance of routing protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks,2013,"The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed of small sensor nodes capable of sensing (collecting), processing and transmitting data related to some phenomenon in the environment. However, the sensor nodes have severe constraints, such as: low network bandwidth, short wireless communication range, and limited CPU processing capacity, memory storage and power supply. Therefore, maximizing the benefits of limited resources in WSNs have become one relevant and challenging issue. One of the most relevant problem is related with the energy consumption during data transmission, since, sensor nodes are battery-powered and recharging or replacing batteries, in most cases, is infeasible. Communication in WSN consumes more energy than sensing and processing performed by the network nodes. The strategy proposed in this paper, to reduce the energy consumption, consists in optimizing the operations of routing protocols. The WSN routing protocols must have self configuration features in order to find out which is the best route for communication, thus increasing delivery assurance and decreasing the energy consumption between nodes that comprise the network. This paper presents a proposal for estimating the quality of routes using fuzzy systems to assist the Directed Diffusion routing protocol. The fuzzy system is used to estimate the degree of the route quality, based on the number of hops and the energy level of the nodes that compose a route. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to adjust, in an automatic way, the rule base of the fuzzy system in order to improve the classification strategy of routes, hence increasing the energy efficiency of the network. The simulations showed that the proposal is effective from the point of view of three metrics: packet loss rate, message delay to the sink node and time of death of the first sensor node."
1837688,13990,10192,A Multimedia-Based Fuzzy Queue-Aware Routing Approach for Wireless Mesh Networks,2011,"The proliferation of multimedia content and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are changing the Internet facilities and life style of fixed and mobile users. For the success of the next generation wireless networks, novel multimedia approaches with quality level assurance are required to allow the distribution of video-streaming, video conference, gaming, multimedia social networking, green multimedia content and other entrainment applications for thousand of users in ubiquitous wireless (mesh) systems. In this context, new routing schemes are needed to provide end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) support for delay/loss/jitter-sensitive multimedia applications in WMNs. The well-known OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) protocol with ETX (Expected Transmission Count) metric bring many benefits for the path selection process, but present a drawback in the queue availability management and reduce the system performance. Therefore, multimedia-related packets will suffer with loss/delay/jitter and the system overall performance will decrease. This paper proposes the Queue-based OLSR ETX (QoETX) approach to overcome the limitations of OLSR-ETX regarding queue availability by using a cross-layer scheme and supporting QoS and QoE assurance. QoETX optimizes network and user-based parameters by coordinating queue availability, QoS and fuzzy issues in the routing decision process as a way to allocate the best paths for multimedia applications. In order to present the benefits of the proposed solution compared with existing routing schemes, namely OLSR-ETX, OLSR-FLC, OLSR-MD and HWMP (IEEE 802.11s standard), regarding QoS (block probability and throughput) and QoE (PSNR, SSIM, VQM and MOS) parameters, performance evaluations were carried by using the Network Simulator (NS-2.34)."
1301014,13990,8839,CloudIQ: a framework for processing base stations in a data center,2012,"The cellular industry is evaluating architectures to distribute the signal processing in radio access networks. One of the options is to process the signals of all base stations on a shared pool of compute resources in a central location. In this centralized architecture, the existing base stations will be replaced with just the antennas and a few other active RF components, and the remainder of the digital processing including the physical layer will be carried out in a central location. This model has potential benefits that include a reduction in the cost of operating the network due to fewer site visits, easy upgrades, and lower site lease costs, and an improvement in the network performance with joint signal processing techniques that span multiple base stations. Further there is a potential to exploit variations in the processing load across base stations, to pool the base stations into fewer compute resources, thereby allowing the operator to either reduce energy consumption by turning the remaining processors off or reducing costs by provisioning fewer compute resources. We focus on this aspect in this paper.   Specifically, we make the following contributions in the paper. Based on real-world data, we characterise the potential savings if shared homogeneous compute resources are used to process the signals from multiple base stations in the centralized architecture. We show that the centralized architecture can potentially result in savings of at least 22 % in compute resources by exploiting the variations in the processing load across base stations. These savings are achievable with statistical guarantees on successfully processing the base station's signals. We also design a framework that has two objectives: (i) partitioning the set of base stations into groups that are simultaneously processed on a shared homogeneous compute platform for a given statistical guarantee, and (ii) scheduling the set of base stations allocated to a platform in order to meet their real-time processing requirements. This partitioning and scheduling framework saves up to 19 % of the compute resources for a probability of failure of one in 100 million. We refer to this solution as CloudIQ. Finally we implement and extensively evaluate the CloudIQ framework with a 3GPP compliant implementation of 5 MHz LTE."
839073,13990,20774,Broadcasting in logarithmic time for ad hoc network nodes on a line using mimo,2013,"We consider  n  wireless ad hoc network nodes with one antenna each and equidistantly placed on a line. The transmission power of each node is just large enough to reach its next neighbor. For this setting we show that a message can be broadcasted to all nodes in time  O (log  n ) without increasing each node's transmission power. Our algorithm needs  O (log  n ) messages and consumes a total energy which is only a constant factor larger than the standard approach where nodes sequentially transmit the broadcast message to their next neighbors. We obtain this by synchronizing the nodes on the fly and using MIMO (multiple input multiple output) techniques.   To achieve this goal we analyze the communication capacity of multiple antennas positioned on a line and use a communication model which is based on electromagnetic fields in free space. We extend existing communication models which either reflect only the sender power or neglect the locations by concentrating only on the channel matrix. Here, we compute the scalar channel matrix from the locations of the antennas and thereby only consider line-of-sight-communication without obstacles, reflections, diffractions or scattering.   First, we show that this communication model reduces to the SINR power model if the antennas are uncoordinated. We show that  n  coordinated antennas can send a signal which is  n  times more powerful than the sum of their transmission powers. Alternatively, the power can be reduced to an arbitrarily small polynomial with respect to the distance. For coordinated antennas we show how the well-known power gain for MISO (multiple input single output) and SIMO (single input multiple output) can be described in this model. Furthermore, we analyze the channel matrix and prove that in the free space model no diversity gain can be expected for MIMO.   Finally, we present the logarithmic time broadcast algorithm which takes advantage of the MISO power gain by self-coordinating wireless nodes."
794923,13990,8839,SecureArray: improving wifi security with fine-grained physical-layer information,2013,"Despite the important role that WiFi networks play in home and enterprise networks they are relatively weak from a security standpoint. With easily available directional antennas, attackers can be physically located off-site, yet compromise WiFi security protocols such as WEP, WPA, and even to some extent WPA2 through a range of exploits specific to those protocols, or simply by running dictionary and human-factors attacks on users' poorly-chosen passwords. This presents a security risk to the entire home or enterprise network. To mitigate this ongoing problem, we propose SecureArray, a system designed to operate alongside existing wireless security protocols, adding defense in depth against active attacks. SecureArray's novel signal processing techniques leverage multi-antenna access point (AP) to profile the directions at which a client's signals arrive, using this angle-of-arrival (AoA) information to construct highly sensitive signatures that with very high probability uniquely identify each client. Upon overhearing a suspicious transmission, the client and AP initiate an AoA signature-based challenge-response protocol to confirm and mitigate the threat. We also discuss how SecureArray can mitigate direct denial-of-service attacks on the latest 802.11 wireless security protocol. We have implemented SecureArray with an eight-antenna WARP hardware radio acting as the AP. Our experimental results show that in a busy office environment, SecureArray is orders of magnitude more accurate than current techniques, mitigating 100% of WiFi spoofing attack attempts while at the same time triggering false alarms on just 0.6% of legitimate traffic. Detection rate remains high when the attacker is located only five centimeters away from the legitimate client, for AP with fewer numbers of antennas and when client is mobile."
1364315,13990,10162,Using rule mining to understand appliance energy consumption patterns,2014,"Managing energy in the home is key to creating a sustainable future for our society. More tools are increasingly available to measure home energy usage, however these tools provide little insight into questions such as why an appliance consumes more energy than normal or what kinds of behavioral changes might be most likely to reduce energy usage in the home. To answer these questions, a deeper understanding of the causal factors that influence energy usage is necessary. In this work, we conduct a broad study of factors that influence energy consumption of individual devices in the home. Our first contribution is collection of a context-rich data set from six homes across the United States. The second contribution of this work is a set of insights into key factors influencing energy usage derived by the novel application of a rule mining algorithm to identify significant associations between energy usage and four key features: hour of the day, day of the week, use of other appliances in the home, and user-supplied annotations of activities such as working or cooking. Our analysis confirms our hypothesis that, though most devices show a regular pattern of daily or weekly use, this is not true for all devices. Associations that relate use of two different devices in the same home are often stronger, and are observed for nearly 25% of device uses. Overall, we observe that the associations derived from the first five weeks of data in our data set are sufficient to explain nearly 70% of the device uses in the subsequent five weeks of data, and over 90% of the associations identified during the first five weeks recur in the latter portion of the data set. The associations identified by our approach may be used to to aid in end-user applications that heighten awareness and encourage energy savings, improve energy disaggregation algorithms, or even detect anomalous uses that may signal problems in aging-in-place homes."
3031581,13990,22021,Passive learning of the interference graph of a wireless network,2012,"A key challenge in wireless networking is the management of interference between transmissions. Identifying which transmitters interfere with each other is crucial. Complicating this task is the fact that the topology of wireless networks can change from time to time, and so the identification process may need to be carried out on a regular basis. Injecting active probing traffic to assess interference can lead to unacceptable overhead, and so this paper focuses on interference estimation based on passive traffic monitoring in networks that use the CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance) protocol. A graph is used to represent the interference in the network, where the nodes represent transmitters and edges represent interference between pairs of transmitters. We investigate the problem of learning the graph structure based on passive observations of network traffic transmission patterns and information about successes or failures in transmissions. Previous work has focused on algorithms and validations in small testbed networks. This paper focuses on the scaling behavior of such methods which is unaddressed in prior work. In particular we establish bounds on the minimum observation period required to identify the interference graph reliably. The main results are expressed in terms of the total number of nodes n and the maximum number of interfering transmitters per node (i.e., maximum node degree) d. The effects of hidden terminal interference (i.e., interference not detectable via carrier sensing) on the observation time requirement are also quantified. We show that it is necessary and sufficient that the observation period grows like d 2  log n, and we propose a practical algorithm that reliably identifies the graph from this length of observation. We conclude that the observation requirements scale quite mildly with network size, and that the networks with sparse interference patterns can be more rapidly identified than those with dense interference patterns."
1405337,13990,8228,Unidirectional error correction by crypto functions,2013,"Asymmetric errors are observed in many communication channels or memory systems. Some non-volatile memory systems and optical media exhibit such error behavior in a unidirectional fashion. The lifetime of such units depends often on aging, and especially on the number of access cycles performed resulting with such unidirectional error behavior. In many applications, error correcting codes are not deployed in order to save redundancy, costs and complexity. However in many applications, there are security operations such as encryption or hash functions providing strict rules which can serve to detect and even correct errors. Error correcting codes use basically linear mappings, whereas crypto functions involve highly nonlinear confusion and diffusion randomizing functions. In this paper, some hash functions used for authentication are investigated to check experimentally their symmetric and especially unidirectional error correctability. Good hash functions and ciphers are designed to attain a high degree of pseudo-randomizing mappings. Our experimental results on such hash functions showed that, it is possible to efficiently correct a class of selected unidirectional errors by deploying a portion of the hash bits which are typically used solely for authentication. The proposed correction procedure is a hard decision trade-off operation which would improve the system-survivability by slightly reducing its authenticity level without changing the system configuration. This procedure allows a sort of best-effort salvation in some existing systems. The procedure simply modifies the corrupted data experimentally until the hash value becomes valid. This procedure may however turn out to become equivalent to a successful authentication attack. This is however less probable if only a part of the hash bits is deployed in the error correction procedure and if the corrected error-class is kept as small as possible."
1097692,13990,10228,Fault-tolerant resource allocation in multi-hop wireless sensor networks,2014,"since the transmission latency requirement may be guaranteed by using much more resource than the allowance of some outage. Time-division cluster scheduling (TDCS), based on IEEE 802.15.4, calculates required resource for each RT traffic passing through the target device [7]. The TDCS, however, considers only saturated traffic condition, which may lead to severe waste of resource when applied to some data gathering applications (e.g., gathering of infrequent traffic). Moreover, all these schemes consider the use of infinite buffer size (i.e., no overflow in the data buffer). M/D/c/c+B queuing model may be applied to analyze the performance of TDMA systems with finite buffer size [8]. But it does not consider the channel error, making it inappropriate for application to wireless networks. In this paper, we consider resource allocation in the uplink of multi-hop wireless networks with the use of data buffers with finite size, in consideration of the transmission latency and the presence of transmission error. We first analyze the buffer occupation probability (BOP) of each router in the network. Then, we derive the probability of buffer overflow and calculate the probability that the transmission latency exceeds a required latency limit. We finally derive the outage probability associated with the buffer overflow and the excess of transmission latency limit. Exploiting the analytic results, we design a resource allocation method allows to utilize the minimum resource while guaranteeing desired outage probability. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly enhances the performance when applied to IEEE 802.15.4 networks. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the system model. Section III analyzes the performance (e.g., the outage probability) of WSNs in the presence of transmission error. Section IV proposes a resource allocation scheme applicable to tree-structured WSNs. Section V verifies the analytic results of Section III and the performance of the proposed resource allocation. Finally, conclusions are given in Section VI."

As the demand for applications that can harness the capabilities of a sensor-rich environment increases, and the availability of sensing infrastructure put in place to monitor various quantities soars, there are clear benefits in a model where infrastructure can be shared amongst multiple applications. This model however introduces many challenges, mainly related to the management of the communication of the same application running on different network nodes, and the isolation of applications within the network.#R##N##R##N#At the same time, security concerns related to terrorism, crime, and lower-level anti-social behaviour and fraud have placed pressure on government agencies to be seen to be doing something to respond. Extensive surveillance is the easy option, as already seen in the UK with the installation of millions of CCTV cameras and a political fondness for the database state[ABD+09]. The emergence of low cost pervasive sensing will present another tempting target for surveillance. While there may be legitimate reasons for situational awareness from time to time, placing all citizens under the microscope 24/7 has a well-known corrosive effect on society[Fun04].#R##N##R##N#Thus, the combination of dynamic requirements for privacy, and occasional surveillance results in new security challenges.

2037578,13990,10228,Ultra-Wideband channel model for intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks,2012,"Intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks is a promising new research area that can provide part cost, assembly, maintenance savings and fuel efficiency through the elimination of the wires, and enable new sensor technologies to be integrated into vehicles, which would otherwise be impossible using wired means, such as Intelligent Tire. The most suitable technology that can meet high reliability, strict energy efficiency and robustness requirements of these sensors in such a harsh environment at short distance is Ultra-Wideband (UWB). However, there are currently no detailed models describing the UWB radio channel for intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks making it difficult to design a suitable communication system. We analyze the small-scale and large-scale statistics of the UWB channel based on a measurement campaign for a variety of sensor locations beneath the chassis of a vehicle. The analysis for large-scale statistics show that the characteristics of the channel around the tires is very different from the other parts under the chassis. The path loss exponents around the tires and under chassis are 4 and 2.2 respectively. The clustering phenomenon observed in the averaged power delay profile can be well-modeled by Saleh-Valenzuela model. The clusters decay exponentially with arrival time but with a smaller decay constant after 30ms. The decay rate of ray amplitudes is increasing with delay and can be modeled using a dual slope linear model in logarithmic scale. The best fit for inter-cluster arrival time is Weibull distribution. The analysis for small-scale statistics on the other hand show that the best fit for the received energies in each bin at 81 locations of the measurement grid is lognormal distribution with decreasing μ and almost constant σ parameters. Moreover, different bins of the delay can be assumed to fade independently. This is the first work to model small-scale channel characteristics for intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks."

However, due to the dynamic nature of wireless channels, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose 4C, a novel link estimator that applies link quality prediction along with link estimation. Our approach is data-driven and consists of three steps: data collection, offline modeling and online prediction. The data collection step involves gathering link quality data, and based on our analysis of the data, we propose a set of guidelines for the amount of data to be collected in our experimental scenarios. The modeling step includes offline prediction model training and selection. We present three prediction models that utilize different machine learning methods, namely, naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression and artificial neural networks. Our models take a combination of PRR and the physical layer information, i.e., Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) as input, and output the success probability of delivering the next packet. From our analysis and experiments, we find that logistic regression works well among the three models with small computational cost. Finally, the third step involves the implementation of 4C, a receiver-initiated online link quality prediction module that computes the short temporal link quality. We conducted extensive experiments in the Motelab and our local indoor testbeds, as well as an outdoor deployment. Our results with single and multiple senders experiments show that with 4C, CTP improves the average cost of delivering a packet by 20% to 30%. In some cases, the improvement is larger than 45%."
1427208,13990,369,Performance Evaluation of A Resource Allocation Scheme for Mixed Traffic in Dynamic-TDD Network,2014,"Dynamic uplink and downlink reconfiguration is studied as an effective method to improve the system packet throughput performance in the LTE Heterogeneous Network. There are various kinds of traffic with different quality of service requirements in the practical wireless network, which has not been fully considered by the existing resource allocation strategies for dynamic TDD. In this paper, a resource allocation scheme coordinating the time and frequency resource for mixed traffic in the dynamic TDD scenario is proposed, which can guarantee the system requirements, such as time delay budget, packet drop rate and packet throughput. Utilities of users with different services are considered in the scheduling and dynamic UL-DL reconfiguration. Theoretical analysis and system level simulation are carried out to evaluate the performance. The simulation results show that compared with the existing resource allocation schemes, the proposed one offers a better performance, which are low packet drop rate of VoIP users and high packet throughput of FTP users. like best effort (BE) data traffic without delay requirement. The other one is real-time (RT) services with QoS requirements about packet drop rate and packet delay, such as VoIP or video service. It's of great significance to consider differences of the mixed traffic to avoid the waste of resource and improve users' experience. There have been several algorithms for the dynamic uplink- downlink resource allocation. In (2), the amount of UL/DL data to be transmitted in the buffer is calculated for reconfiguration. In (3), the reconfiguration is based on the UL and DL data currently in the buffer and considers the impact of historical traffic data, while full bandwidth scheduling with simple First-in-First-out (FIFO) rule is used for frequency resource allocation. The spectral efficiency of UL or DL is also taken into account, and latency-based proportional fair (PF) scheduler is used (4). However, these algorithms only deal with certain traffic model without consideration of the quality of service (QoS) requirement. The QoS aware reconfiguration method for mixed traffic is proposed in (5), but the FIFO"
2252553,13990,10228,Statistical broadcast protocol design with WiBDAT: Wireless Broadcast design and analysis tool,2011,"Multi-hop broadcast routing is a critical component in ad-hoc wireless networks. Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) applications for example use broadcast communications extensively. Efficient broadcast protocols are required to enable these applications. Multi-hop broadcast algorithms can roughly be classified as either topological or statistical. Statistical protocols are well-suited to applications such as VANET, because they are tolerant of rapid changes in network topology and can be designed to accommodate transmission failures due to fading and collisions. However, unlike topological protocols, statistical methods are highly stochastic in nature so it is not possible to analytically prove these algorithms will connect all nodes in the network. Instead, designers attempt to measure and minimize the probability nodes will not receive a broadcast message. Thus simulation plays an important role in the design and validation of these protocols. The key design factor in statistical protocols is the rebroadcast decision threshold curve. There are no analytical tools for creating these threshold curves, so like many stochastic systems, simulation models are required to develop them. Empirically discovering good threshold curves using simulation models requires many simulation iterations, and thus can be extremely time consuming if these iterations are slow. As a solution, this work introduces the Wireless Broadcast Design and Analysis Tool (WiBDAT), a fast and scalable high-level network simulator built from the ground up specifically for wireless broadcast. WiBDAT provides tools for quickly designing efficient statistical broadcasting protocols and evaluating their performance at a high level. WiBDAT is easy to use and extend, implements a wide variety of broadcast protocols, and provides clear results including innovative visualizations of node and transmit densities."
1856838,13990,22164,Wireless backhaul node placement for small cell networks,2014,"Small cells have been proposed as a vehicle for wireless networks to keep up with surging demand. Small cells come with a significant challenge of providing backhaul to transport data to(from) a gateway node in the core network. Fiber based backhaul offers the high rates needed to meet this requirement, but is costly and time-consuming to deploy, when not readily available. Wireless backhaul is an attractive option for small cells as it provides a less expensive and easy-to-deploy alternative to fiber. However, there are multitude of bands and features (e.g. LOS/NLOS, spatial multiplexing etc.) associated with wireless backhaul that need to be used intelligently for small cells. Candidate bands include: sub-6 GHz band that is useful in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, microwave band (6–42 GHz) that is useful in point-to-point line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, and millimeter wave bands (e.g. 60, 70 and 80 GHz) that are recently being commercially used in LOS scenarios. In many deployment topologies, it is advantageous to use aggregator nodes, located at the roof tops of tall buildings near small cells. These nodes can provide high data rate to multiple small cells in NLOS paths, sustain the same data rate to gateway nodes using LOS paths and take advantage of all available bands. This work performs the joint cost optimal aggregator node placement, power allocation, channel scheduling and routing to optimize the wireless backhaul network. We formulate mixed integer nonlinear programs (MINLP) to capture the different interference and multiplexing patterns at sub-6 GHz and microwave band. We solve the MINLP through linear relaxation and branch-and-bound algorithm and apply our algorithm in an example wireless backhaul network of downtown Manhattan."
723696,13990,208,Spectrum decision for efficient routing in cognitive radio network,2012,"The cognitive radio (CR) nodes in a cognitive radio network (CRN) do not have license to use specific spectrum band. Instead, they use the spectrum bands of the licensed primary users (PU) without interfering with the PU. When the PU becomes active, interfering CRs should leave to another available spectrum band within the PU's tolerable interference delay (TID). Therefore, CRN operates over wide spectrum bands which span many channels. Since each channel is typically licensed to one PU, this requires that channels be sensed separately. This adds monitoring overhead, where the CR should monitor (sense) the channel every TID, which reduces the throughput. For this reason, the node cannot monitor the whole set of channels. Deciding which set of channels to monitor affect other functions in the CRN like routing. Work done on routing in literature assumes that each node maintains a set of available channels which is obtained by sensing. Route setup decision will be made based on the available sets at all nodes. However, there may be some other available channels that the node is not aware of their availability which may enhance the routing quality metric. Also, taking into consideration only the sets of channels available at the CR nodes may preclude finding an end-to-end path. In this paper, we propose a spectrum decision framework that is complementary to the existing routing protocols. This framework is based on two objectives: 1) enhancing the route quality by sensing a few more channels at some nodes. These channels can enhance the quality by: reducing the switching time, requiring shorter sensing time, or expected to be available for longer time; 2) increasing the probability of finding a path by sensing more channels at some nodes in case the routing protocol did not find a path. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can result in enhancement that can be as high as 100% over the routing protocols that build their decisions based on the available channels at each node only."

The European Commission has adopted a similar stance by pledging to quot;reuse spectrum and create a single market out of itquot;. The EC has gone as far as to call the radio spectrum the quot;economic oxygenquot;. The approach whereby license-exempt (or unlicensed) devices are allowed (under certain, often very stringent, conditions) to access unused areas of the airwaves or gaps that exist in bands that have been reserved for TV broadcasts (so-called TV White Spaces), is being trialed in the US as well as the UK and the rest of Europe, with Japan preparing its own TVWS roll-out timeline. TV White Space spectrum is an attractive alternative to expensive auctioned spectrum, for applications including e.g. small cells. In this paper we discuss an evolutionary approach looking beyond the current/emerging TV White Space concepts, for which we adopt the term Bandwidth Scavenging and which has the potential to: serve Primary User (PU) systems other than DTT; enable more dynamic spectrum sharing than the TVWS systems by providing incentives for the PU systems; allow Secondary Users (SUs) to serve as relays for PU traffic. We examine co-operation between the incumbents and SUs and demonstrate the trade-offs possible using a MATLAB simulator. We then highlight some of the changes needed in existing communication systems for the observed benefits to become a reality. We additionally discuss various models of spectrum sharing and changes needed in current spectrum legislation to support the proposed approach to collaboration."
1343975,13990,8839,Experiencing and handling the diversity in data density and environmental locality in an indoor positioning service,2014,"Diversity in training data density and environment locality is intrinsic in the real-world deployment of indoor localization systems and has a major impact on the performance of existing localization approaches. In this paper, through micro-benchmarks, we find that fingerprint-based approaches are preferable in scenarios where a dense database is available; while model-based approaches are the method of choice in the case of sparse data. It should be noted, however, that practical situations are complex. A single deployment often features both sparse and dense sampled areas. Furthermore, the internal layout affects the propagation of radio signals and exhibits environmental impacts. A certain number of measurement samples may be sufficient for one part of the building, but entirely insufficient for another. Thus, finding the right indoor localization algorithm for a given large-scale deployment is challenging, if not impossible; there is no one-size-fits-all indoor localization approach.   Realizing the fundamental fact that the quality of the location database capturing the actual radio map dictates localization accuracy, in this paper, we propose Modellet, an algorithmic approach that optimally approximates the actual radio map by unifying model-based and fingerprint-based approaches. Modellet represents the radio map using a  fingerprint-cloud  that incorporates both measured real fingerprints and virtual fingerprints, which are computed from models with a local support, based on the key concept of the  supporting set . We evaluate Modellet with data collected from an office building as well as 13 large-scale deployment venues (shopping malls and airports), located across China, U.S., and Germany. Comparing Modellet with two representative baseline approaches, RADAR and EZPerfect, demonstrates that Modellet effectively adapts to different data densities and environmental conditions, substantially outperforming existing approaches."
1073827,13990,10162,Extraction of latent patterns and contexts from social honest signals using hierarchical Dirichlet processes,2013,"A fundamental task in pervasive computing is reliable acquisition of contexts from sensor data. This is crucial to the operation of smart pervasive systems and services so that they might behave efficiently and appropriately upon a given context. Simple forms of context can often be extracted directly from raw data. Equally important, or more, is the hidden context and pattern buried inside the data, which is more challenging to discover. Most of existing approaches borrow methods and techniques from machine learning, dominantly employ parametric unsupervised learning and clustering techniques. Being parametric, a severe drawback of these methods is the requirement to specify the number of latent patterns in advance. In this paper, we explore the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods, a recent data modelling framework in machine learning, to infer latent patterns from sensor data acquired in a pervasive setting. Under this formalism, nonparametric prior distributions are used for data generative process, and thus, they allow the number of latent patterns to be learned automatically and grow with the data - as more data comes in, the model complexity can grow to explain new and unseen patterns. In particular, we make use of the hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDP) to infer atomic activities and interaction patterns from honest signals collected from sociometric badges. We show how data from these sensors can be represented and learned with HDP. We illustrate insights into atomic patterns learned by the model and use them to achieve high-performance clustering. We also demonstrate the framework on the popular Reality Mining dataset, illustrating the ability of the model to automatically infer typical social groups in this dataset. Finally, our framework is generic and applicable to a much wider range of problems in pervasive computing where one needs to infer high-level, latent patterns and contexts from sensor data."
1763525,13990,8228,Improving performance of rate control mechanism for UDP traffic over heterogeneous networks,2013,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is an application-driven heterogeneous network, being rapidly deployed across the world. The proposed session layer for IoT is the upcoming standard for Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). The transport layer of choice for IoT is emerging to be UDP. CoAP itself mandates usage of UDP only as the transport layer. It is well-known that practical usage of UDP requires extra employment of congestion control, generally in form of rate control. For bursty source data that is generated most of the while in IoT, usage of rate control is a must. Configuring the rate control parameters requires knowledge of the performance of the underlying network. In this paper, we first experimentally measure, analyze and model performance parameters, e.g. avg. bandwidth, round-trip delay and jitter, of a real heterogeneous wide area network. Based on the analysis, we then provide two novel, intuitive algorithms for source node rate control, and destination node timer management. These algorithms were found to improve the reception performance over that achievable using guidelines provided in RFC 5405. For delivery of urgent/critical data in IoT, we had earlier proposed usage of session-level forward error control (FEC) of the communicated data. Usage of our algorithms ensured that the deployment of the FEC scheme, which employed lightweight rate-10/11 Reed-Solomon codes, succeeded 98% of the while, while sending as many as 10 packets per burst. The algorithms can be re-used with similar high performance levels, in many other communication contexts also, that entail low-volume, bursty data traffic visualized in RFC 5405. Hence the algorithms may be considered for augmentation of CoAP standard."
1960274,13990,9589,From Cells to Streets: Estimating Mobile Paths with Cellular-Side Data,2014,"Through their normal operation, cellular networks are a repository of continuous location information from their subscribed devices. Such information, however, comes at a coarse granularity both in terms of space, as well as time. For otherwise inactive devices, location information can be obtained at the granularity of the associated cellular sector, and at infrequent points in time, that are sensitive to the structure of the network itself, and the level of mobility of the device. In this paper, we are asking the question of whether such sparse information can help to identify the paths followed by mobile connected devices throughout the day. If such a task is possible, then we would not only enable continuous mobility path estimation for smartphones, but also for the millions of future connected things.   The challenge we face is that cellular data has one to two orders of magnitude less spatial and temporal resolution than typical GPS traces. Our contribution is to devise path segmentation, de-noising, and inference procedures to estimate the device stationary location, as well as its mobility path between stationary positions. We call our technique  Cell* . We complement the lack of spatio-temporal granularity with information on the cellular network topology, and GIS (Geographic Information System).   We collect more than 3,000 mobility trajectories over 8 months and show that  Cell*  achieves a median error of 230 m  for the stationary location estimation, while mobility paths are estimated with a median accuracy of 70 m . We show that mobility path accuracy improves with its length and speed, and counter to our intuition, accuracy appears to improve in suburban areas.  Cell*  is the first technology, we are aware of, that allows location services for the new generation of connected mobile devices, that may feature no GPS, due to cost, size, or battery constraints."
1489880,13990,369,5GNOW: Challenging the LTE Design Paradigms of Orthogonality and Synchronicity,2013,"LTE and LTE-Advanced have been optimized to deliver high bandwidth pipes to wireless users. The transport mechanisms have been tailored to maximize single cell performance by enforcing strict synchronism and orthogonality within a single cell and within a single contiguous frequency band. Various emerging trends reveal major shortcomings of those design criteria: (1) The fraction of machine-type-communications (MTC) is growing fast. Transmissions of this kind are suffering from the bulky procedures necessary to ensure strict synchronism. (2) Collaborative schemes have been introduced to boost capacity and coverage (CoMP), and wireless networks are becoming more and more heterogeneous following the non-uniform distribution of users. Tremendous efforts must be spent to collect the gains and to manage such systems under the premise of strict synchronism and orthogonality. (3) The advent of the Digital Agenda and the introduction of carrier aggregation are forcing the transmission systems to deal with fragmented spectrum. 5GNOW will question the design targets of LTE and LTE-Advanced having these shortcomings in mind. The obedience of LTE and LTE-Advanced to strict synchronism and orthogonality will be challenged. It will develop new PHY and MAC layer concepts being better suited to meet the upcoming needs with respect to service variety and heterogeneous transmission setups. A demonstrator will be built as Proof-of-Concept relying upon continuously growing capabilities of silicon based processing. Wireless transmission networks following the outcomes of 5GNOW will be better suited to meet the manifoldness of services, device classes and transmission setups being present in envisioned future scenarios like smart cities. The integration of systems relying heavily on MTC, e.g. sensor networks, into the communication network will be eased. The per-user experience will be more uniform and satisfying. To ensure this 5GNOW will contribute to upcoming 5G standardization."

In this paper, we study the effect of these hostile conditions on the performance of different schemes providing warning message dissemination. We then propose the Junction Store and Forward (JSF) and the Nearest Junction Located (NJL) schemes, which were specially designed to be used in very low and very high density scenarios, respectively. Simulation results using real maps demonstrate how our proposed schemes are able to outperform existing warning message dissemination schemes in urban environments under adverse vehicle density conditions. Index Terms—Vehicular ad hoc networks, warning message dissemination, adverse density conditions, VANETs message propagation scheme should be aware of the vehicle density, since lower densities can provoke message losses due to reduced communication capabilities, whereas higher densities can provoke a reduced message delivery effectiveness due to serious redundancy, contention, and massive packet collisions caused by simultaneous forwarding, usually known as broadcast storm (4). In this paper, we study the performance of typical broadcast dissemination schemes under hostile density conditions, i.e., vehicle densities far from the average values in vehicular environments and especially adverse for message dissemina- tion. Based on this analysis, we propose the Junction Store and Forward (JSF) and the Nearest Junction Located (NJL), our two novel dissemination schemes to be used under low and high density conditions, respectively. Our main goal is to maximize the message delivery effectiveness, something difficult to achieve, especially in adverse conditions. The paper is organized as follows: in Section II we review existing dissemination schemes related to our proposal. In Section III we introduce our proposed schemes, i.e., the JSF, and the NJL approaches. Section IV shows the simulation envi- ronment used to validate our proposal. Section V presents and discusses the obtained results. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper."
1094745,13990,9015,DSP.Ear: leveraging co-processor support for continuous audio sensing on smartphones,2014,"The rapidly growing adoption of sensor-enabled smartphones has greatly fueled the proliferation of applications that use phone sensors to monitor user behavior. A central sensor among these is the microphone which enables, for instance, the detection of valence in speech, or the identification of speakers. Deploying multiple of these applications on a mobile device to continuously monitor the audio environment allows for the acquisition of a diverse range of sound-related contextual inferences. However, the cumulative processing burden critically impacts the phone battery.   To address this problem, we propose DSP.Ear -- an integrated sensing system that takes advantage of the latest low-power DSP co-processor technology in commodity mobile devices to enable the continuous and simultaneous operation of multiple established algorithms that perform complex audio inferences. The system extracts emotions from voice, estimates the number of people in a room, identifies the speakers, and detects commonly found ambient sounds, while critically incurring little overhead to the device battery. This is achieved through a series of pipeline optimizations that allow the computation to remain largely on the DSP. Through detailed evaluation of our prototype implementation we show that, by exploiting a smartphone's co-processor, DSP.Ear achieves a 3 to 7 times increase in the battery lifetime compared to a solution that uses only the phone's main processor. In addition, DSP.Ear is 2 to 3 times more power efficient than a naive DSP solution without optimizations. We further analyze a large-scale dataset from 1320 Android users to show that in about 80-90% of the daily usage instances DSP.Ear is able to sustain a full day of operation (even in the presence of other smartphone workloads) with a single battery charge."
636536,13990,208,Backbone Discovery In Thick Wireless Linear Sensor Networks,2014,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) constitute an important area of research that is emerging. This is taking place due to the rapid and significant developments, which have led to sensing devices with increasingly smaller size, faster processing, lower energy consumption, as well as larger storage and communication capacities. In addition, as the amount of physical, chemical and biological conditions that are able to be sensed increases, WSNs are finding numerous applications in areas such as environmental, military, health care, and infrastructure monitoring. Many of these applications involve lining up the sensors in a linear form, making a special class of these networks, which are defined as Linear Sensor Networks (LSNs). In a previous paper, we introduced LSNs and provided a classification and motivation for designing networking protocols that can take advantage of the predictable linearity of the topology in order to optimize the performance, reliability, fault tolerance, energy consumption, and network lifetime. In this paper, we provide a topology discovery protocol for thick LSNs where, due to the nature of the monitored structure or area, and the deployment strategy, the nodes are assumed to exist between two parallel lines that extend for a relatively long distance compared to their transmitting range. As a result of the discovery process, a small percentage of the deployed nodes are selected to be a part of a backbone, which can be used for efficient communication between the other nodes in the LSN. The protocol takes advantage of the linearity of the network in order to reduce the amount of exchanged control messages, reduce energy consumption, and increase scalability. Two different strategies for topology discovery are presented, and simulated in order to verify and compare their operation, and efficiency."

The goal of our work is to understand the performance afforded by each of these technologies in diverse environments and use conditions. In this paper, we compare and contrast cellular and WiFi performance using crowd-sourced data from Speedtest.net. Our study considers spatio-temporal performance (upload/download throughput and latency) using over 3 million user-initiated tests from iOS and Android apps in 15 different metro areas collected over a 15 week period. Our basic performance comparisons show that  (i)  WiFi provides better absolute download/upload throughput, and a higher degree of consistency in performance;  (ii)  WiFi networks generally deliver lower absolute latency, but the  consistency  in latency is often better with cellular access;  (iii)  throughput and latency vary widely depending on the particular access type  e.g. , HSPA, EVDO, LTE, WiFi,  etc .) and service provider. More broadly, our results show that performance consistency for cellular and WiFi is much lower than has been reported for  wired  broadband. Temporal analysis shows that average performance for cell and WiFi varies with time of day, with the best performance for large metro areas coming at non-peak hours. Spatial analysis shows that performance is highly variable across metro areas, but that there are subregions that offer consistently better performance for cell or WiFi. Comparisons between metro areas show that larger areas provide higher throughput and lower latency than smaller metro areas, suggesting where ISPs have focused their deployment efforts. Finally, our analysis reveals diverse performance characteristics resulting from the rollout of new cell access technologies and service differences among local providers."

Actual research and development activities focus on wireless connected and mobile system architectures. The resulting network topologies represent embedded, distributed systems, which are able to process complex tasks in a cooperative way. Here, most of the hardware platforms are energy self-sufficient with strongly limited resources. In consequence, the maximisation of the system runtime is essential to fulfil all application tasks as long as possible. Especially in long-term scenarios (e.g. WSN / SANET), the runtime depends on the efficiency of communication processes. Hence, the key challenge for researchers and engineers represents the application-specific integration of adapted communication concepts, radio technologies, and protocol stacks into an energy-efficient communication architecture. In this paper, we critically discuss energy efficiency in distributed, embedded systems with focus on the communication aspects. We introduce an easy to use estimation model for quantifying the energy efficiency on both local (system) and global (network) layer. The included cost functions consider the power consumption as well as timing aspects. In this context, we evaluate several optimisation strategies under real-world conditions within a heterogeneous network environment We integrate an asynchronous communication paradigm, wake-up-receiver technologies, and data aggregation techniques in a stepwise process. Accordingly, the respective analysis compares the results and clarifies the importance of an application-specific system design. If the communication architecture and the configuration scheme fits to the environmental conditions, significant optimisations for the energy efficiency are observable."
1898479,13990,8228,Triage-based automated analysis of evidence in court cases of copyright infringement,2012,"Over the past few years, the number of crimes related to the worldwide diffusion of digital devices with large storage and broadband network connections has increased dramatically. In order to better address the problem, law enforcement specialists have developed new ideas and methods for retrieving evidence more effectively. In accordance with this trend, our research aims to add new pieces of information to the automated analysis of evidence according to Machine Learning-based “post mortem” triage. The scope consists of some copyright infringement court cases coming from the Italian Cybercrime Police Unit database. We draw our inspiration from this “low level” crime which is normally sat at the bottom of the forensic analyst's queue, behind higher priority cases and dealt with the lowest priority. The present work aims to bring order back in the analyst's queue by providing a method to rank each queued item, e.g. a seized device, before being analyzed in detail. The paper draws the guidelines for drive-under-triage classification (e.g. hard disk drive, thumb drive, solid state drive etc.), according to a list of crime-dependent features such as installed software, file statistics and browser history. The model, inspired by the theory of Data Mining and Machine Learning, is able to classify each exhibit by predicting the problem dependent variable (i.e. the class) according to the aforementioned crime-dependent features. In our research context the “class” variable identifies with the likelihood that a drive image may contain evidence concerning the crime and, thus, the associated item must receive an high (or low) ranking in the list."
1076198,13990,9015,Kyun queue: a sensor network system to monitor road traffic queues,2012,"Unprecedented rate of growth in the number of vehicles has resulted in acute road congestion problems worldwide. Better traffic flow management, based on enhanced traffic monitoring, is being tried by city authorities. In many developing countries, the situation is worse because of greater skew in growth of traffic vs the road infrastructure. Further, the existing traffic monitoring techniques perform poorly in the chaotic non-lane based traffic here.   In this paper, we present  Kyun  Queue, a sensor network system for real time traffic queue monitoring. Compared to existing systems, it has several advantages: it (a) works in chaotic traffic, (b) does not interrupt traffic flow during its installation and maintenance and (c) incurs low cost. Our contributions in this paper are four-fold. (1) We propose a new mechanism to sense road occupancy based on variation in RF link characteristics, when line of sight between a transmitter-receiver pair is obstructed. (2) We design algorithms to classify traffic states into congested or free-flowing at time scales of 20 seconds with above 90% accuracy. (3) We design and implement the embedded platforms needed to do the sensing, computation and communication to form a network of sensors. This network can correlate the traffic state classification decisions of individual sensors, to detect multiple levels of traffic congestion or traffic queue length on a given stretch of road, in real time. (4) Deployment of our system on a Mumbai road, after careful consideration of issues like localization and interference, gives correct estimates of traffic queue lengths, validated against 9 hours of image-based ground truth. Our system can provide input to several traffic management applications like traffic light control, incident detection, and congestion monitoring."
1211217,13990,10162,Pushing the spatio-temporal resolution limit of urban air pollution maps,2014,"Up-to-date information on urban air pollution is of great importance for health protection agencies to assess air quality and provide advice to the general public in a timely manner. In particular, ultrafine particles (UFPs) are widely spread in urban environments and may have a severe impact on human health. However, the lack of knowledge about the spatio-temporal distribution of UFPs hampers profound evaluation of these effects. In this paper, we analyze one of the largest spatially resolved UFP data set publicly available today containing over 25 million measurements. We collected the measurements throughout more than a year using mobile sensor nodes installed on top of public transport vehicles in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Based on these data, we develop land-use regression models to create pollution maps with a high spatial resolution of 100m × 100 m. We compare the accuracy of the derived models across various time scales and observe a rapid drop in accuracy for maps with subweekly temporal resolution. To address this problem, we propose a novel modeling approach that incorporates past measurements annotated with metadata into the modeling process. In this way, we achieve a 26% reduction in the root-mean-square error—a standard metric to evaluate the accuracy of air quality models—of pollution maps with semi-daily temporal resolution. We believe that our findings can help epidemiologists to better understand the adverse health effects related to UFPs and serve as a stepping stone towards detailed real-time pollution assessment."
1101902,13990,20348,"Fine-grained remote monitoring, control and pre-paid electrical service in rural microgrids",2014,"In this paper, we present the architecture, design and experiences from a wirelessly managed microgrid deployment in rural Les Anglais, Haiti. The system consists of a three-tiered architecture with a cloud-based monitoring and control service, a local embedded gateway infrastructure and a mesh network of wireless smart meters deployed at 52 buildings. Each smart meter device has an 802.15.4 radio that enables remote monitoring and control of electrical service. The meters communicate over a scalable multi-hop TDMA network back to a central gateway that manages load within the system. The gateway also provides an 802.11 interface for an on-site operator and a cellular modem connection to a cloud-backend that manages and stores billing and usage data. The cloud backend allows occupants in each home to pre-pay for electricity at a particular peak power limit using a text messaging service. The system activates each meter within seconds and locally enforces power limits with provisioning for theft detection. We believe that this fine-grained micro-payment model can enable sustainable power in otherwise unfeasible areas.   This paper provides a chronology of our deployment and installation strategy that involved GPS-based site mapping along with various network conditioning actions required as the network evolved. Finally, we summarize key lessons learned and hypothesis about additional hardware that could be used to ease the tracing of faults like short circuits and downed lines within microgrids."
1169962,13990,23712,Multi-path TCP: Boosting Fairness in Cellular Networks,2014,"Cellular providers are rapidly deploying multiple technologies like cell biasing, carrier aggregation, co-ordinated interference control/scheduling to improve capacity and coverage. In this paper, we explore a complementary transport layer approach based on multipath TCP that can concurrently use multiple interfaces to boost throughput of users with poor coverage and improve fairness. Multipath TCP has been recently standardized by IETF and requires no modifications to applications. It has been shown to improve fairness and throughput in wire line environments and individual user throughputs in wireless networks. However, in a wireless multi-user environment, it is not clear that it is always beneficial, as we show in this paper. Therefore, we examine if it is indeed beneficial for a service provider to judiciously decide whether to enable multiple cellular interfaces on a smart phone based on a global centralized view of its network. Alternatively, should a device decide independently based only on a local view? To quantify the network wide impact in a system where users have multiple cellular interfaces, we have developed centralized and distributed heuristic algorithms to evaluate this, particularly in the context of fairness across all the users. Our simulations and numerical models show that there are potential gains in fairness (15-30%) to be realized by judiciously enabling multipath connections at the cell edge. These gains diminish as the number of users in a cell increases or users behave greedily. We also quantify the delicate balance between throughput and fairness. Our analysis provides an intuition on which user(s) in a cellular network stand to benefit the most by enabling multiple interfaces. We also discuss LTE protocol mechanisms to enforce associations of specific interfaces to specific cells."
1671558,13990,208,FastForward: High-Throughput Dual-Radio Streaming,2013,"The high popularity of wireless sensor networks has led to novel applications with diverse, and sometimes demanding, data communication requirements, for example, streaming camera images in surveillance applications. In response bulk-data transfer protocols were proposed that provide low latency and high throughput communication over multiple hops. However, due to typical hardware platforms only providing a single radio, which implies that forwarding nodes need to serialize send and receive actions, the maximum end-to-end throughput is limited to 1/2 the radio capacity. To bridge this performance gap we present Fast Forward, a connection-oriented multi-hop bulk-data transfer protocol optimized for dual-radio platforms, data packets are sent across a path of alternating radio and frequency channels to exploit parallel transfers and avoid intra-path interference. We implemented Fast Forward in TinyOS to run on the Opal platform equipped with two IEEE 802.15.4 radios. In this paper we show that, with some minor tweaking of the original protocol stack to streamline internal access to the SPI bus, Fast Forward is capable of operating both radios in parallel so packets can be forwarded at full speed. We have evaluated Fast Forward on a 12-node testbed in an office environment. The sustained throughput peaks around 23.7 kBps, or 76 % of the radio capacity while the best single-radio protocol flattens out at 19 %. When introducing artificial packet loss the built-in link-level acknowledgements ensure that Fast Forward manages to deliver packets with high yield (close to 100 %) at the sink across 11 hops."
2191236,13990,10162,Time-lag method for detecting following and leadership behavior of pedestrians from mobile sensing data,2013,"The vast availability of mobile phones with built-in movement and location sensors enable the collection of detailed information about human movement even indoors. As mobility is a key element of many processes and activities, an interesting class of information to extract is movement patterns that quantify how humans move, interact and group. In this paper we propose methods for detecting two common pedestrian movement patterns, namely individual following relations and group leadership. The proposed methods for identifying following patterns employ machine learning on features derived using similarity analysis on time lagged sequences of WiFi measurements containing either raw signal strength values or derived locations. To detect leadership we combine the individual following relations into directed graphs and detect leadership within groups by graph link analysis. Methods for detecting these movement patterns open up new possibilities in - amongst others - computational social science, reality mining, marketing research and location-based gaming. We provide evaluation results that show error rates down to 7%, improving over state of the art methods with up to eleven percentage points for following patterns and up to twenty percentage points for leadership patterns. Our method is, contrary to state of the art, also applicable in challenging indoor environments, e.g., multi-story buildings. This implies that even quite small samples allow us to detect information such as how events and campaigns in multistory shopping malls may trigger following in small groups, or which group members typically take the lead when triggered by e.g. commercials, or how rescue or police forces act during training exercises."
2155636,13990,21102,Automated design of fuzzy rule base using ant colony optimization for improving the performance in Wireless Sensor Networks,2013,"The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed of small sensor nodes capable of sensing (collecting), processing and transmitting data related to some phenomenon in the environment. The sensor nodes have severe constraints, such as: limited power supply, low network bandwidth, short wireless communication range, and limited CPU processing and memory storage. Communication in WSN consumes more energy than sensing and processing performed by the network nodes. Therefore, as the sensor nodes are battery-powered and recharging or replacing batteries, in most cases, is infeasible, maximizing the benefits of limited resources in WSNs have become one relevant and challenging issue. The WSN routing protocols must have autoconfiguration features in order to find out which is the best route for communication, thus increasing delivery assurance and decreasing the energy consumption between nodes that comprise the network. This paper presents a proposal for estimating the quality of routes using fuzzy systems to assist the Directed Diffusion routing protocol. The fuzzy system is used to estimate the degree of the route quality, based on the number of hops and the lowest energy level among the nodes that form the route. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to adjust in an automatic way the rule base of the fuzzy system in order to improve the classification strategy of routes, hence increasing the energy efficiency of the network. The simulations showed that the proposal is effective from the point of view of the packet loss rate, the necessary time to send a specific number of messages to the sink node and the lifetime of the first sensor node, which is defined as the period that the first sensor node die due to the battery depletion."
1866750,13990,8228,Channel quality-based AMC and smart scheduling scheme for SVC video transmission in LTE MBSFN networks,2012,"Mobile TV and Video on Demand (VoD) streaming services represents an important service which will be provided by Fourth Generation (4G) cellular networks. Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) is one of the most successful 4G technologies used by most of the 4G operators for delivering mobile broadband. In the past, cellular systems have mostly focused on unicast transmission systems. But, with the adoption of new services which are intended to be delivered to a broad range of users, multicast and broadcast systems are becoming widely popular. Enhanced Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (EMBMS) is defined in 3GPP specification to support download delivery and streaming delivery to group users in LTE mobile networks. In 3GPP Release 8 specification, the EMBMS transmission is classified into single-cell transmission and MBSFN (Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network) transmission. H.264 was the recommended video codec for Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) MBMS service. However, the Scalable Video Coding (SVC) extension of H.264 allows efficient temporal, spatial and quality scalabilities. In this paper, we propose a video streaming method with SVC for MBSFN networks with adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and frequency scheduling based on distribution of users in different channel quality regions. Through simulations we demonstrate that spectrum savings in the order of 72 to 82% is achievable in different user distribution scenarios with our proposed scheme. These savings in spectrum can be used for serving other MBSFN, single cell MBMS or unicast bearers, and it can also be used for increasing the video quality of the same MBSFN bearer."
1933476,13990,11470,Game theoretical analysis of wireless multiview video multicast using cooperative peer-to-peer repair,2011,"Receivers of wireless video broadcast can suffer catastrophic decoding errors when experiencing heavy packet losses due to transmission channel fades. Cooperative repair schemes, exploiting the “uncorrelatedness” in wireless channels of peers physically located more than one transmission wavelength apart, call for neighboring peers listening to the same video stream to locally share received packets via a secondary network. Since the likelihood of the entire peer group suffering fades in statistically independent channels at the same time is very small, cooperative peers can collectively recover lost packets via local packet sharing with high probability. For interactive multiview video streaming (IMVS), where a client receives and watches only one periodically selected view out of N available, the packet recovery problem is more challenging, since the likelihood of a neighboring cooperative peer watching the same view as a channel-corrupted peer is now 1/N. To enable cooperative recovery even when neighboring peers are watching different but correlated video views, cleverly designed redundantly coded information (RCI) such as Distributed Source Coded (DSC) frames are inserted into streams of different views. On one hand, RCI in the video streams promotes cooperative repair among peers watching different views; on the other, it leaves fewer available bits for channel coding, given a fixed transmission budget, to combat channel noise. In this paper, using game theoretical analysis, we search for the optimal amount of RCI in the video streams to foster the right balance between cooperation among peers and leftover bits for channel coding to maximize decoding success. Experimental results show that expected video decoding probability can be increased noticeably compared to non-optimized resource allocation schemes."
2163870,13990,10162,WizNet: A ZigBee-based sensor system for distributed wireless LAN performance monitoring,2013,"802.11-based wireless LANs (WLANs) have become an important communication infrastructure for today's pervasive computing applications. Nevertheless, WLAN users often experience various performance issues such as highly variable signal quality. To diagnose such transient service degradations and plan for future network upgrades, it is essential to closely monitor the performance of a WLAN and collect user statistics. This paper proposes a new WLAN performance monitoring approach motivated by the fact that many low-power wireless technologies such as ZigBee and Bluetooth co-exist with WLAN in the same open radio spectrum and are capable of sensing Received Signal Strength (RSS) of 802.11 transmissions. We have developed a ZigBee-based WLAN monitoring system called WizNet. Powered by batteries, ZigBee sensors of WizNet can be deployed in large quantities to monitor the spatial performance of a WLAN in long periods of time. By adopting digital signal processing techniques, WizNet automatically identifies 802.11 signals from ZigBee RSS measurements and associates them with wireless access points. To ensure the monitoring fidelity, WizNet accounts for the significant differences in ZigBee and WLAN radios, such as bandwidth and susceptibility to multipath and frequency-selective fading. A simple yet accurate linear estimator derived from a signal propagation model is used to infer the access points' signal to noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, WizNet can measure the congestion level of the channel and detect rogue APs. WizNet can also collect WLAN client statistics and classify device models based on RSS signatures of 802.11 access point scans. We have implemented WizNet in TinyOS 2.x and extensively evaluated its performance on a wireless testbed. Our results over a period of 140 hours show that WizNet can accurately capture the spatial and temporal performance variability of a large-scale production WLAN."
1339870,13990,208,SmartSensing: Sensing Through Walls with Your Smartphone!,2014,"Seeing through walls and knowing clearly what exist inside just like a superman are not only fantastic wishes for humans, but also of much practical significance. For example, you would like to know whether there are pipes, or rebars inside a wall before drilling into it. Moreover, knowing how pipes are configured in a wall before attempting to fix defects would definitely prevent unnecessary damages. Existing methods that intend to address this issue are either costly due to the use of high-end technology, or too restrictive for reasons of some strong assumptions. However, in this paper, we present a novel system, SmartSening, which is based on off-the-shelf sensors embedded in smartphones. SmartSensing makes full use of in-built sensors, namely, the accelerometer, the gyroscope, and the magnetometer to achieve this goal inexpensively and conveniently. Specifically, by combining these sensors, we are able to clearly distinguish certain objects inside a wall. In addition, the layout of a pipeline system can be mapped out automatically in an economical and laborsaving way. We implement this system on two different kinds of smartphone platforms, namely iPhone4 and Xiaomi Mi2S. We conduct experiments in a proof-of-concept testbed of size 1.8m×1.0m. Experimental results show that SmartSensing can achieve no less than an average accuracy of 96%, 89% and 77% in distinguishing objects under three different depths, respectively. Also, as for layout mapping, it can achieve less than 32cm and 28cm length error with 90% probability on average for whole horizontal and vertical pipeline segments, with a 6.8m and 4.0m total length, respectively."
2093593,13990,10192,ASER Analysis of Cooperative Non-Regenerative Relay Systems over Generalized Fading Channels,2011,"In this article, we present a novel moment generating function (MGF) approach for performance evaluation of twohops cooperative non-regenerative multi-relay networks over a myriad of stochastic channel models. First, we develop very tight exponential approximations for the erfc(.) and erfc2(.) functions which will facilitate the development of a unified closed-form expression for the average symbol error rate (ASER) of a wide range of digital modulation schemes over generalized fading channels (with and without cooperative diversity). Next, we derive a new asymptotic approximation for the MGF of signalto noise ratio (SNR) of a two-hops relayed path in cooperative amplify-and-forward (CAF) diversity systems, which closely approximates its exact MGF. Combining these two techniques allows us to dramatically reduce the computational complexity for ASER of CAF multi-relay networks that have been treated in the literature for specific fading environments, besides providing accurate ASER estimates for CAF relay networks in many fading environments that heretofore had resisted a simple solution. Moreover, our final expression for the MGF of end-to-end SNR is expressed in closed-form, which is a desirable attribute for system-level performance analysis and optimization such as optimal power assignment among cooperative relay nodes, ergodic capacity analysis with adaptive transmission policies, outage probability, joint PHY/MAC layer design, and so on. The accuracies of our approximations have been validated with exact closed-form formulas that are available for specific wireless fading environments (e.g., Rayleigh and Nakagami-m channels) and via Monte Carlo computer simulations."
1938066,13990,20348,Improving RF-based device-free passive localization in cluttered indoor environments through probabilistic classification methods,2012,"ABSTRACT Radio frequency based device-free passive localization has been proposed as an alternative to indoor localization because it does not require subjects to wear a radio device. This technique observes how people disturb the pattern of radio waves in an indoor space and derives their positions accordingly. The well-known multipath effect makes this problem very challenging, because in a complex environment it is impractical to have enough knowledge to be able to accurately model the effects of a subject on the surrounding radio links. In addition, even minor changes in the environment over time change radio propagation sufficiently to invalidate the datasets needed by simple fingerprint-based methods. In this paper, we develop a fingerprinting-based method using probabilistic classification approaches based on discriminant analysis. We also devise ways to mitigate the error caused by multipath effect in data collection, further boosting the classification likelihood. We validate our method in a one-bedroom apartment that has 8 transmitters, 8 receivers, and a total of 32 cells that can be occupied. We show that our method can correctly estimate the occupied cell with a likelihood of 97.2%. Further, we show that the accuracy remains high, even when we significantly reduce the training overhead, consider fewer radio devices, or conduct a test one month later after the training. We also show that our method can be used to track a person in motion and to localize multiple people with high accuracies. Finally, we deploy our method in a completely different commercial environment with two times the area achieving a cell estimation accuracy of 93.8% as an evidence of applicability to multiple environments."
1702118,13990,369,Cell Edge Throughput Improvement by Base Station Cooperative Transmission Control with Reference Signal Interference Canceller in LTE System,2012,"Inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) is attracting attention recently. This is a technique mainly improving cell-edge throughput by coordinating scheduling and signal transmission of multiple BSs. Different from joint transmission (JT), in which the desired signals for a user equipment (UE) are simultaneously transmitted from multiple BSs, the burdens of information exchange among BSs and its attendant signal processing are mitigated in ICIC because it requires only the exchange of scheduling and control information. In ICIC, the cell-edge throughput is improved by adaptively preventing BSs from transmitting signals (in other words, muting BSs) that would otherwise impose strong interference on the cell- edge UEs in the neighbor cells. Although this improves cell-edge throughput, it may degrade cell overall performance because no radio resource is assigned to UEs belonging to the muted BS. To resolve this issue, we first propose a scheduling method, which enables muting only when the throughput improvement (cell-edge UE) obtained by muting is superior to the total throughput possible without muting. Also, when considering applying this ICIC technique to current commercial systems such as LTE, it should be noted that reference signal, also known as pilot signal, is always transmitted regardless of muting because reference signal is a common signal used for channel estimation. To solve this issue, we also propose a reference signal interference canceller, in which the UE cancels the reference signal being transmitted from the neighbor BS. We evaluate the performance improvement by computer simulations and confirm that cell-edge throughput is dramatically improved by introducing the proposed canceller. We also propose a control algorithm that activates the canceller only when throughput improvement is possible. A basic lab experiment was also conducted to confirm the effect of the proposed interference canceller with 3GPP Rel-8 LTE-compliant equipment."
2066595,13990,9015,A novel system design and implementation for realtime sensing and warning of roadway hazards round-the-clock,2012,"Though there exist ready-made DSRC/WiFi/3G/4G cellular systems for roadway communications, there are common defects in these systems for roadway safety oriented applications and the corresponding challenges remain unsolved for years, i.e., WiFi cannot work well in vehicular networks due to the high probability of packet loss caused by burst communications, which is a common phenomenon in roadway networks; 3G/4G cannot well support real-time communications due to the nature of their designs; DSRC lacks the support to roadway safety oriented applications with hard real-time and reliability requirements in the most recent study [1].   To solve the conflict between the capability limitations of existing systems and the ever-growing demands of roadway safety oriented communication applications, we propose a novel system design and implementation for realtime warnings of roadway hazards, e.g., physical hazards such as puddles, rocks, and pits on the road, and behavioral hazards such as lane changing, speeding, careless left-turn, etc. Specifically, our demo aims to provide hazard sensing and warnings to users close to a hazard on the road in a realtime and reliable manner.   In our extensive experimental study, the latency is well controlled within the hard realtime requirement (100 ms ) for roadway safety applications given by NHTSA, and the reliability is proved to be improved by two orders of magnitude compared with existing experimental results [1]. To our best knowledge, it is the first system for roadway safety applications that provides guaranteed highly reliable packet delivery ratio of 99% within the strict hard-realtime requirement 100 ms  under various scenarios, e.g., highways, city areas, rural areas, tunnels, bridges. Even in the worst case that burst warnings coming from multiple neighboring vehicles at the same time, the experimental results still show that the system is able to stably receive 99% warning messages within the hard realtime requirement 100 ms . Our design can be widely applied for roadway safety applications and facilitate the current research in both hardware and software design and further provide an opportunity to consolidate the existing work on a practical and easy-configurable low-cost roadway safety oriented system."
1356735,13990,22021,Collective sensing-capacity of bacteria populations,2012,"The design of biological networks using bacteria as the basic elements of the network is initially motivated by a phenomenon called quorum sensing. Through quorum sensing, each bacterium performs sensing the medium and communicating it to others via molecular communication. As a result, bacteria can orchestrate and act collectively and perform tasks impossible otherwise. In this paper, we consider a population of bacteria as a single node in a network. In our version of biological communication networks, such a node would communicate with one another via molecular signals. As a first step toward such networks, this paper focuses on the study of the transfer of information to the population (i.e., the node) by stimulating it with a concentration of special type of a molecules signal. These molecules trigger a chain of processes inside each bacteria that results in a final output in the form of light or fluorescence. Each stage in the process adds noise to the signal carried to the next stage. Our objective is to measure (compute) the maximum amount of information that we can transfer to the node. This can be viewed as the collective sensing capacity of the node. The molecular concentration, which carries the information, is the input to the node, which should be estimated by observing the produced light as the output of the node (i.e., the entire population of bacteria forming the node. The molecules are trapped in the bacteria receptors forming complexes inside the bacteria which affect the genes responsible for producing the light. We focus on the noise caused by the random process of trapping molecules at the receptors as well as the variation of outputs of different bacteria in the node. The optimal input distribution to maximize the mutual information between the output of the node, e.g., light, and the applied molecule concentration is derived. Further, the capacity variation with the number of bacteria in the node and the number of receptors per bacteria is obtained. Finally, we investigated the collective sensing capability of the node when a specific form of molecular signaling concentration (which resembles M-ary modulation) is used. The achievable sensing capacity and the corresponding error probabilities were obtained for such practical signaling techniques."
918519,13990,9589,Communication Networks of Visible Light Emitting Diodes with Intra-Frame Bidirectional Transmission,2014,"Unlike traditional radio frequency communication of consumer devices, the optical antenna direction of Visible Light Communication (VLC), i.e., the Field-Of-View (FOV), varies greatly from device to device. This encompasses wide FOVs of ambient infrastructure and directional FOVs of light emitted by low-end embedded devices. This variety of light wave propagation can severely affect the transmission reliability, despite ``pointing'' devices to each other may seem enough for a reliable link. In particular, the fact that FOVs are unknown makes traditional access protocols in VLC unreliable in presence of interference among nodes of different FOVs and exacerbates the hidden-node problem. In this paper, we propose a Carrier Sensing Multiple Access/Collision Detection&Hidden Avoidance (CSMA/CD-HA) Medium Access Control protocol for a network where each node solely uses one Light Emitting Diode (LED) to transmit and receive data. The CSMA/CD-HA can enable in-band intra-frame bidirectional transmission with just one optical antenna. The key idea is to exploit the intra-frame data symbols without emission of light to introduce an embedded communication channel. This approach enables the transmission of additional data while receiving in the same optical channel and it makes the communication robust to different types of FOVs. We build a software-defined embedded platform running on Linux operating system, implement the CSMA/CD-HA protocol, and evaluate its performance through experiments. Results show that collisions caused by hidden nodes can be reduced and our protocol can increase the saturation throughput by nearly up to 50% and 100% under the two-node and four-node scenarios, respectively."
1728218,13990,8228,Enabling adaptive rate and relay selection for 802.11 mobile ad hoc networks,2012,"Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are self-configuring wireless networks that lack permanent infrastructure and are formed among mobile nodes on demand. Rapid node mobility results in dramatic channel variation, or fading, that degrades MANET performance. Employing channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter can improve the throughput of routing and medium access control (MAC) protocols for mobile ad hoc networks. Several routing algorithms in the literature explicitly incorporate the fading signal strength into the routing metric, thus selecting the routes with strong channel conditions. While these studies show that adaptation to the time-variant channel gain is beneficial in MANETs, they do not address the effect of the outdated fading CSI at the transmitter. For realistic mobile node speeds, the channel gain is rapidly varying, and becomes quickly outdated due the feedback delay. We analyze the link throughput of joint rate adaptation and adaptive relay selection in the presence of imperfect CSI. Moreover, for an 802.11 network that employs geographic opportunistic routing with adaptive rate and relay selection, we propose a novel method to reduce the effect of the feedback delay at the MAC layer in the presence of Rayleigh fading. This method exploits channel reciprocity and fading prediction and does not require significant modification to the existing 802.11 frame structure. Extensive network simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the throughput, delay, and packet delivery ratio for high mobile velocities relative to previously proposed approaches that employ outdated CSI at the transmitter."
1056842,13990,9589,Is there a case for mobile phone content pre-staging?,2013,"Content caching is a fundamental building block of the Internet. Caches are widely deployed at network edges to improve performance for end-users, and to reduce load on web servers and the backbone network. Considering mobile 3G/4G networks, however, the bottleneck is at the access link, where bandwidth is shared among all mobile terminals. As such, per-user capacity cannot grow to cope with the traffic demand. Unfortunately, caching policies would not reduce the load on the wireless link which would have to carry multiple copies of the same object that is being downloaded by multiple mobile terminals sharing the same access link.   In this paper we investigate if it is worth to push the caching paradigm even farther. We hypothesize a system in which mobile terminals implement a local cache, where popular content can be pushed/pre-staged. This exploits the peculiar broadcast capability of the wireless channels to replicate content for free on all terminals, saving the cost of transmitting multiple copies of those popular objects. Relying on a large data set collected from a European mobile carrier, we analyse the content popularity characteristics of mobile traffic, and quantify the benefit that the push-to-mobile system would produce. We found that content pre-staging, by proactively and periodically broadcasting bundles of popular objects to devices, allows to both greatly i) improve users' performance and ii) reduce up to 20% (40%) the downloaded volume (number of requests) in optimistic scenarios with a bundle of 100 MB. However, some technical constraints and content characteristics could question the actual gain such system would reach in practice."
860868,13990,9748,Double Free: Measurement-Free Localization for Transceiver-Free Object,2014,"Transceiver-free object localization is essential for emerging location-based service, e.g., the safe guard system and asset security. It can track indoor target without carrying any device and has attracted many research effort. Among these technologies, Radio Signal Strength (RSS) based approaches are very popular because of their low-cost and wide applicability. In such work, usually a large number of reference nodes have to be deployed. However, if in a very large area, many labor work to measure the positions of the reference nodes have to be performed, result in not practical in real scenario. In this paper, we propose Double Free, which can accurately track transceiver-free object without measuring the positions of the reference nodes. Users may randomly deploy nodes in a 2D area, e.g., the ceiling of the floor. Our Double Free contains two steps: reference node localization and target localization. The key to achieve the first step is to utilize the RSS difference in different channel to distinguish the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) signal from combined multiple paths' signal. Thus, the reference nodes can be accurately localized without additional hardware. In the second step, we propose two algorithms: Influential Link & Node (ILN) and MultiPath Distinguishing (MD). ILN is simple to implement, while MD can accurately model the additional signal caused by the target, then accurately localize the target. To implement this idea, 16 TelosB nodes are placed randomly in a 25×10m2 laboratory. The experiment results show, the average localization error is only round 2 meters without requiring to measure the positions of reference nodes in advance. It shows enormous potential in those localization areas, where manual measurement is hard to perform, or hard labor work want to be saved."
2397503,13990,8228,Distributed Source Coding for WWAN Multiview Video Multicast with Cooperative Peer-to-Peer Repair,2011,"Video multicast over Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN) is difficult because of unavoidable packet losses and impracticality of retransmission on a per packet, per client basis, due to the known NAK implosion problem. Recent approach exploits clients' cooperation for packet recovery, so that a peer group's received WWAN packets are shared using a secondary network like Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). For multiview video multicast, where a client can switch views interactively by subscribing to different WWAN multicast channels streaming different views, two new difficulties arise. First, system must provide timely view-switching mechanism, so that client can switch to a desired view quickly for correct decoding and display. Second, it is difficult for system to leverage neighboring peers for cooperative loss recovery, since neighbors are more likely to be subscribing to different views than a loss-stricken peer. In this paper, we use Distributed Source Coding (DSC), a new compression tool in video coding, to solve both problems. Each DSC frame is encoded with a set of predictor frames, and correct decoding only requires one of the predictors in the set to be available at decoder. Periodic insertion of DSC frames into video streams then enables a peer to switch from view v to v' at the DSC frame boundary, assuming DSC frame of view v' was encoded using a frame in view v as one predictor. For the same assumption, a neighbor watching view v can help a peer watching view v' evade error propagation resulting from earlier losses and resume decoding at the DSC boundary. Experiments show that optimized usage of DSC frames in a coding structure, where unequal error protection is enabled to decrease the probability of decoding failure earlier in a group of pictures, outperforms a structure using I-frames instead for view switching by up to 11dB in video quality in typical WWAN network loss environment."
2354216,13990,11470,Distributed Markov decision process in cooperative peer-to-peer repair for WWAN video broadcast,2011,"Error resilient video broadcast over Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN) remains difficult due to unavoidable packet losses (a result of the underlying unreliable and time-varying transmission medium) and unavailability of per-packet, per-user retransmissions (stemming from the well-known NAK implosion problem). Previous cooperative solutions for multi-homed devices listening to the same video broadcast call for local recovery via packet sharing: assuming peers are physically located more than one transmission wavelength apart, channels to the streaming source are statistically independent, and peers can exchange different subsets of received packets with neighbors via a secondary network like ad hoc Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) to alleviate individual WWAN packet losses. While it is known that using structured network coding (SNC) to encode received packets before peer exchange can further improve packet repair performance, the decisions of who should send repair packets encoded in what SNC types at available transmission opportunities were not optimized in any formal way. In this paper, we propose a distributed decision making strategy based on Markov decision process (MDP), so that each peer can make locally optimal transmission decisions based on observations eavesdropped on the WLAN channel. Our proposed MDP is both computationally scalable and peer-adaptive, so that state transition probabilities in MDP can be appropriately estimated based on observed aggregate behavior of other peers. Experiments show that decisions made using our proposed MDP outperformed decisions made by a random scheme by at least 4dB in PSNR in received video quality."
921759,13990,10228,UPTIME: Ubiquitous pedestrian tracking using mobile phones,2012,"The mission of tracking a pedestrian is valuable for many applications including walking distance estimation for the purpose of pervasive healthcare, museum and shopping mall guides, and locating emergency responders. In this paper, we show how accurate and ubiquitous tracking of a pedestrian can be performed using only the inertial sensors embedded in his/her mobile phone. Our work depends on performing dead reckoning to track the user's movement. The main challenge that needs to be addressed is handling the noise of the low cost low quality inertial sensors in cell phones. Our proposed system combines two novel contributions: a novel step count estimation technique and a gait-based accurate variable step size detection algorithm. The step count estimation technique is based on a lightweight finite state machine approach that leverages orientation-independent features. In order to capture the varying stride length of the user, based on his changing gait, we employ a multi-class hierarchical Support Vector Machine classifier. Combining the estimated number of steps with the an accurate estimate of the individual stride length, we achieve ubiquitous and accurate tracking of a person in indoor environments. We implement our system on different Android-based phones and compare it to the state-of-the-art techniques in indoor and outdoor testbeds with arbitrary phone orientation. Our results in two different testbeds show that we can provide an accurate step count estimation with an error of 5.72%. In addition, our gait type classifier has an accuracy of 97.74%. This leads to a combined tracking error of 6.9% while depending only on the inertial sensors and turning off the GPS sensor completely. This highlights the ability of the system to provide ubiquitous, accurate, and energy efficient tracking."
1472174,13990,8228,Ameba network architecture based on advanced multi-layer network and its configuration algorithm,2013,"In future networks, unknown and unintended traffic implosion and hot spot congestion may give serious damage because of heavy traffic implosion and rapid traffic fluctuation. To tackle this issue, the research on virtual network and next-generation network has been advancing. As a result, network control can be much more flexible than before. However, from the perspective of network architecture, the current approaches with fixed IP node/OXC node location still remain larger possibility to enhance the flexibility. Namely, novel solution is eagerly anticipated. For realization of highly advanced next-generation network, this paper suggests novel network architecture that can decrease a network scale, especially, not at the link level but at the entire topology level by adaptively leveraging the underlying OXC networks and by making virtual node function composed of several distantly positioned OXCs, named “Ameba Node”. Main benefits of the proposed Ameba Network include as follows. First, network-level load balancing can be attained by adaptively reconfiguring the Ameba network topology without any other complicated traffic engineering. Second, simple and naive routing algorithm and network controls would be applied thanks to its network level load-balancing capability. Thirdly, IP routing/optical-layer routing processes, and the resultant network resources can be balanced flexibly. Finally, flexibility on node renewal or network scale-up can be realized by not replacing old routers to most advanced brand-new ones but reconfiguring the shape of Ameba nodes in network adaptively. We also evaluate its effectiveness by computer simulation."
861129,13990,10162,Analysis methods for extracting knowledge from large-scale WiFi monitoring to inform building facility planning,2014,"The optimization of logistics in large building complexes with many resources, such as hospitals, require realistic facility management and planning. Current planning practices rely foremost on manual observations or coarse unverified assumptions and therefore do not properly scale or provide realistic data to inform facility planning. In this paper, we propose analysis methods to extract knowledge from large sets of network collected WiFi traces to better inform facility management and planning in large building complexes. The analysis methods, which build on a rich set of temporal and spatial features, include methods for noise removal, e.g., labeling of beyond building-perimeter devices, and methods for quantification of area densities and flows, e.g., building enter and exit events, and for classifying the behavior of people, e.g., into user roles such as visitor, hospitalized or employee. Spatio-temporal visualization tools built on top of these methods enable planners to inspect and explore extracted information to inform facility-planning activities. To evaluate the methods, we present results for a large hospital complex covering more than 10 hectares. The evaluation is based on WiFi traces collected in the hospital's WiFi infrastructure over two weeks observing around 18000 different devices recording more than a billion individual WiFi measurements. For the presented analysis methods we present quantitative performance results, e.g., demonstrating over 95% accuracy for correct noise removal of beyond building perimeter devices. We furthermore present detailed statistics from our analysis regarding people's presence, movement and roles, and example types of visualizations that both highlight their potential as inspection tools for planners and provide interesting insights into the test-bed hospital."
840856,13990,23712,Obstacle Shadowing Influences in VANET Safety,2014,"Wireless communications between vehicles enables both safety applications, such as accident avoidance, and nonsafety applications, such as traffic congestion alerts [1] with the intent of improving safety in driving conditions. Because cost limited test-bed environments constrain prototype testing, VANET researchers often turn instead to simulation toolsets from which a rich set of environmental scenarios are modeled. However, despite the availability of such tools, results are inconsistent. While VANET investigators often model propagation loss deterministically dependent upon transmitter receiver distance, fading and shadowing effects are often modeled stochastically, leading to probabilistic results which are independent of the actual environment and thus fail to consider realistic road topologies and the presence of obstacles [2]. In this work, we implement for ns-3 [3] the empirically-validated obstacle shadowing model from [4] by leveraging building data from Open Street Map (OSM) [5] to deterministically evaluate line of sight propagation effects using techniques from computational geometry, and we further extend results to evaluate safety performance assessments. The impact to safety performance measurement of obstacles in VANET simulations motivates the following research objective: The goal of this research is to show quantitatively how accurate, deterministic obstacle fading models impact the performance assessment of VANET safety applications. Deterministic shadowing compares differently than stochastic fading and failing to account for the effects of obstacles in safety assessment can inaccurately or even greatly overstate the performance of VANET safety applications. Including realistic obstacle shadowing in VANET simulation modeling improves VANET assessment and strengthens safety, thus supporting one of the primary goals of connected vehicle systems."
2101103,13990,10228,Model predictive control for smooth distributed power adaptation,2012,"This paper addresses the distributed power adaptation (DPA) problem on the downlink for wireless cellular networks. As a consequence of uncoordinated local scheduling decisions in classical networks, the base stations produce mutual uncontrolled interference on their co-channel users. This interference is of a variable nature, and is hardly predictable, which leads to suboptimal scheduling and power control decisions. While some works propose to introduce cooperation between BS, in this work we propose instead to introduce a model of power variations, called trajectories in the powers space, to help each BS to predict the variations of other BS powers. The trajectories are then updated using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) to adapt transmit powers according to a trade-off between inertia (to being predictable) and adaptation to fit with capacity needs. A Kalman filter (KF) is used for the interference prediction. In addition, the channel gains are also predicted, in order to anticipate channel fading states. This scheme can be seen as a dynamic distributed uncoordinated power control for multichannel transmission that fits the concept of self-optimised and self-organised wireless networks (SON). By using the finite horizon MPC, the transmit powers are smoothly adapted to progressively leave the current trajectory toward the optimal trajectory. We formulate the optimisation problem as the minimisation of the utility function of the difference between the target powers and MPC predicted power values. The presented simulation results show that in dynamic channel conditions, the benefit of our approach is the reduction of the interference fluctuations, and as a consequence a more accurate interference prediction, which can further lead to a more efficient distributed scheduling, as well as the reduction of the overall power consumption."
1531979,13990,8839,Tagoram: real-time tracking of mobile RFID tags to high precision using COTS devices,2014,"In many applications, we have to identify an object and then locate the object to within high precision (centimeter- or millimeter-level). Legacy systems that can provide such accuracy are either expensive or suffering from performance degradation resulting from various impacts,  e.g. , occlusion for computer vision based approaches.   In this work, we present an RFID-based system, Tagoram, for object localization and tracking using COTS RFID tags and readers. Tracking  mobile  RFID tags in  real time  has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving  high precision . Our system achieves these three goals by leveraging the phase value of the backscattered signal, provided by the COTS RFID readers, to estimate the location of the object. In Tagoram, we exploit the tag's mobility to build a virtual antenna array by using readings from a few physical antennas over a time window. To illustrate the basic idea of our system, we firstly focus on a simple scenario where the tag is moving along a fixed track known to the system. We propose Differential Augmented Hologram (DAH) which will facilitate the instant tracking of the mobile RFID tag to a high precision. We then devise a comprehensive solution to accurately recover the tag's moving trajectories and its locations, relaxing the assumption of knowing tag's track function in advance.   We have implemented the Tagoram system using COTS RFID tags and readers. The system has been tested extensively in the lab environment and used for more than a year in real airline applications. For lab environment, we can track the mobile tags in real time with a millimeter accuracy to a median of 5 mm  and 7.29 mm  using linear and circular track respectively. In our year- long large scale baggage sortation systems deployed in two airports, our results from real deployments show that Tagoram can achieve a centimeter-level accuracy to a median of 6.35 cm  in these real deployments."
1356319,13990,8228,Cell switch off technique combined with coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission for energy efficiency in beyond-LTE cellular networks,2012,"With the ever increasing usage of wireless devices, the power consumption and energy efficiency of cellular networks have become important performance indicators. In recent years, various types of energy saving schemes have been proposed for cellular networks. However, most of these schemes do not take advantage of the advanced features offered by the recent cellular standards, such as the 3GPP release 10 (also known as LTE-Advanced) and beyond. One of the recently proposed energy saving schemes in cellular networks is the cell switch off technique in which a lightly loaded cell is completely switched off and the traffic in that region is absorbed by the nearby cells whose transmit powers are increased to enable larger coverage areas. In this paper, we propose to use the cell switch off scheme without increasing the transmit powers of the active cells; instead, we propose to use the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission radio technology, which is being standardized for the beyond-LTE cellular networks, to enable a sufficient received power level from a number of nearby cells whenever possible. Through simulations with realistic parameters, we demonstrate that the above described cell switch off + CoMP combination used with proper CoMP active set degree yields a more energy efficient solution with better received user experience in comparison to the traditional cell switch off schemes. In the proposed scheme, channel estimations are needed in order to determine the CoMP active set accurately. We analyze the performance by modeling the channel estimation error as a Gaussian random variable with 4, 8, and 12 dB standard deviation and observe that perfect channel estimation can provide up to 46% capacity and 24% energy efficiency increase in comparison to the scenarios with the channel estimation errors."
2073840,13990,20896,Realistic case studies of wireless structural control,2013,"Wireless Structural Control (WSC) systems can play a crucial role in protecting civil infrastructure in the event of earthquakes and other natural disasters. Such systems represent an exemplary class of cyber-physical systems that perform close-loop control using wireless sensor networks. Existing WSC research usually employs wireless sensors installed on small lab structures, which cannot capture realistic delays and data loss in wireless sensor networks deployed on large civil structures. The lack of realistic tools that capture both the cyber (wireless) and physical (structural) aspects of WSC systems has been a hurdle for cyber-physical systems research for civil infrastructure. This advances the state of the art through the following contributions. First, we developed the  Wireless Cyber-Physical Simulator (WCPS) , an integrated environment that combines realistic simulations of both wireless sensor networks and structures. WCPS integrates Simulink and TOSSIM, a state-of-the-art sensor network simulator featuring a realistic wireless model seeded by signal traces. Second, we performed two realistic case studies each combining a structural model with wireless traces collected from real-world environments. The  building study  combines a benchmark building model and wireless traces collected from a multi-story building. The  bridge study  combines the structural model of the Cape Girardeau bridge over the Mississippi River and wireless traces collected from a similar bridge (the Jindo Bridge) in South Korea. These case studies shed light on the challenges of WSC and the limitations of a traditional structural control approach under realistic wireless conditions. Finally, we proposed a  cyber-physical co-design  approach to WSC that integrates a novel holistic scheduling scheme (for sensing, communication and control) and an Optimal Time Delay Controller (OTDC) that substantially improves structural control performance."
1112207,13990,8228,Implementing and evaluating improved MAC efficiency through payload extension in 802.11n networks,2013,"Currently, the default size of Internet packets is set at a legacy value of 1500 bytes, since Ethernet was the dominant connection technology. Increasing this size, and thus using larger frames, brings several advantages such as less header overhead and CPU processing. However, the transmission of larger frames also raises several issues impacting data transmission, such as packet loss. With the increase in performance gained from recent wireless technology advances, solutions, such as Frame Aggregation, begin to exploit this increased bandwidth. However, the legacy value is still the dominant one. This paper evaluates the feasibility of increasing the Maximum Transfer Unit for a more efficient data transfer and bandwidth consumption in wireless 802.11n networks. We focus particularly in the experimental implementation and evaluation of the usage of Jumbo-Frames between an Access Point and the connected nodes, featuring a modified kernel that allows the usage of larger payloads, via enhancements to the existing wireless kernel modules. Network performance parameters including bandwidth usage, delay and packet losses are used to assess the benefits and drawbacks of the usage of Jumbo Frames in the wireless medium. Obtained results show that a more efficient medium usage can be achieved by increasing the payload size, when compared with standardized aggregation mechanisms. In addition, the measured packet losses decrease due to a considerable reduction on the number of packets sent for the same bandwidth consumption. To conclude, we perform an evaluation of the proposed enhancement in wireless video streaming scenarios and evaluate the performance gains that such module enables."
1334283,13990,369,Multi-User Detection in Multibeam Mobile Satellite Systems: A Fair Performance Evaluation,2013,"Multi-User Detection (MUD) techniques are currently being examined as promising technologies for the next generation of broadband, interactive, multibeam satellite communication (SatCom) systems. Results in the existing literature have shown that when full frequency and polarization reuse is employed and user signals are jointly processed at the gateway, more than threefold gains in terms of spectral efficiency over conventional systems can be obtained. However, the information theoretic results for the capacity of the multibeam satellite channel are given under ideal assumptions, disregarding the implementation constraints of such an approach. Considering a real system implementation, the adoption of full resource reuse is bound to increase the payload complexity and power consumption. Since these novel techniques require extra payload resources, fairness issues in the comparison among the two approaches arise. The present contribution evaluates in a fair manner, the performance of the return link (RL) of a SatCom system serving mobile users that are jointly decoded at the receiver. In this context, the throughput performance of the assumed system is compared to that of a conventional one, under the constraint of equal physical layer resource utilization; thus the comparison can be regarded as fair. Results show, that even when systems operate under the same payload requirements as the conventional systems, a significant gain can be realized, especially in the high SNR region. Finally, existing analytical formulas are also employed to provide closed form descriptions of the performance of clustered systems, thus introducing insights on how the performance scales with respect to the system parameters."
2029081,13990,8839,SociableSense: exploring the trade-offs of adaptive sampling and computation offloading for social sensing,2011,"The interactions and social relations among users in workplaces have been studied by many generations of social psychologists. There is evidence that groups of users that interact more in workplaces are more productive. However, it is still hard for social scientists to capture fine-grained data about phenomena of this kind and to find the right means to facilitate interaction. It is also difficult for users to keep track of their level of sociability with colleagues. While mobile phones offer a fantastic platform for harvesting long term and fine grained data, they also pose challenges: battery power is limited and needs to be traded-off for sensor reading accuracy and data transmission, while energy costs in processing computationally intensive tasks are high.   In this paper, we propose SociableSense, a smart phones based platform that captures user behavior in office environments, while providing the users with a quantitative measure of their sociability and that of colleagues. We tackle the technical challenges of building such a tool: the system provides an adaptive sampling mechanism as well as models to decide whether to perform computation of tasks, such as the execution of classification and inference algorithms, locally or remotely. We perform several micro-benchmark tests to fine-tune and evaluate the performance of these mechanisms and we show that the adaptive sampling and computation distribution schemes balance trade-offs among accuracy, energy, latency, and data traffic. Finally, by means of a social psychological study with ten participants for two working weeks, we demonstrate that SociableSense fosters interactions among the participants and helps in enhancing their sociability."
929161,13990,22021,The sensitivity of compressed sensing performance to relaxation of sparsity,2012,"Many papers studying compressed sensing consider the noisy underdetermined system of linear equations: y = Ax 0 + z, with n × N measurement matrix A, n  2  I). Both y and A are known, both x 0  and z are unknown, and we seek an approximation to x 0 ; we let δ = n/N Є (0,1) denote the undersampling fraction. In the popular strict sparsity model of compressed sensing, such papers further assume that x 0  has at most a specified fraction e of nonzeros. In this paper, we relax the assumption of strict sparsity by assuming the vector x 0  is close in mean p-th power to a sparse signal. We study how this relaxation affects the performance of l 1 -penalized l 2  minimization, in which the reconstruction x 1,λ  solves min min ‖y − A x ‖ 2  2 /2 + λ‖x‖ 1 . We study asymptotic mean-squared error (AMSE), the large-system limit of the MSE of x 1, λ . Using recently developed tools based on Approximate Message Passing (AMP), we develop expressions for minimax AMSE M ∗  ∊, p (δ, ξ, σ) — max over all approximately sparse signals, min over penalizations λ, where ξ measures the deviation from strict sparsity. There is of course a phase transition curve δ ∗  = δ ∗ (e); only above this curve, δ > δ ∗ (e), can we have exact recovery even in the noiseless-data strict-sparsity setting. It turns out that the minimax AMSE can be characterized succinctly by a coefficient sens ∗  p (є, δ) which we refer to as the sparsity-relaxation sensitivity. We give explicit expressions for sens ∗  p (є, δ), compute them, and interpret them. Our approach yields precise formulas in place of loose order bounds based on restricted isometry property and instance optimality results. Our formulas reveal that sensitivity is finite everywhere exact recovery is possible under strict sparsity, and that sensitivity to added random noise in the measurements y is smaller than the sensitivity to adding a comparable amount of noise to the estimand x 0 . Our methods can also treat the mean q-th power loss. The methods themselves are based on minimax decision theory and seem of independent interest."
1218221,13990,9913,Stochastic topology cognition in heterogeneous networks,2013,"To enable ultra-dense random deployments of fem-tocells toward the fifth generation (5G) cellular networks, effectively autonomous interference mitigation has been regarded as the key for providing unprecedented levels of network capacity and coverage. From recent research and engineering efforts, achieving this goal relies on two promising technologies of cognitive radio (CR) to fully utilize the time-frequency domain radio resources, and stochastic geometry to capture physical distances among nodes (and thus the power domain radio resources). To fully exploit radio resources in all domains of time, frequency, and power, existing schemes impose a strong assumption on the availability of node densities for autonomous resource allocations. To practically validate this assumption, femtocells need to estimate densities of femtocell base stations. However, subject to limited coverage ranges of femtocells, each femtocell can only acquire limited samples insufficient for an accurate estimation. As a result, femtocells need to cooperate with each other. One possible cooperation scheme is selecting a femtocell as fusion center to collect partial information of node densities from all femtocells. This scheme is, however, vulnerable to the fusion center failure and is costly. To provide a robust and efficient scheme, in this paper, we integrate technical merits of CR and stochastic geometry to propose a stochastic network topology cognition framework for femtocells. Our scheme adopts a local processes/estimations of partial information to achieve a competitive performance as compared with that of a unrealistic fusion center, to practically enable a full radio resource utilization in all domains."
988882,13990,8228,Iterative amplitude/phase multiple-symbol differential sphere detection for DAPSK modulated transmissions,2012,"Differentially encoded and non-coherently detected transceivers exhibit a low complexity, since they dispense with complex channel estimation. Albeit this is achieved at the cost of requiring an increased transmit power, they are particularly beneficial, for example in cooperative communication scenarios, where the employment of channel estimation for all the mobile-to-mobile links may become unrealistic. In pursuit of high bandwidth efficiency, differential amplitude and phase shift keying (DAPSK) was devised using constellations of multiple concentric rings. In order to increase resilience against the typical high-Doppler-induced performance degradation of DAPSK and/or enhance the maximum achievable error-free transmission rate for DAPSK modulated systems, multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD) may be invoked. However, the complexity of the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) MSDD increases exponentially with the detection window size and hence may become excessive upon increasing the window size, especially in the context of iterative detection aided channel coded system. In order to circumvent this excessive complexity, we conceive a decomposed two-stage iterative amplitude and phase (A/P) detection framework, where the challenge of having a non-constant-modulus constellation is tackled with the aid of a specifically designed information exchange between the independent A/P detection stages, thus allowing the incorporation of reduced-complexity sphere detection (SD). Consequently, a near-MAP-MSDD performance can be achieved at a significantly reduced complexity, which may be five orders of magnitude lower than that imposed by the traditional MAP-MSDD in the 16-DAPSK scenario considered."
2000765,13990,8228,Secrecy wireless information and power transfer in fading wiretap channel,2014,"Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has recently drawn significant interest for its dual use of radio signals to provide wireless data and energy access at the same time. However, a challenging secrecy communication issue arises as the messages sent to the information receivers (IRs) may be eavesdropped upon by energy receivers (ERs), which are presumed to harvest energy only from received signals. To tackle this problem, the authors propose in this paper an artificial-noise (AN)-aided transmission scheme to facilitate the secrecy information transmission to IRs and, yet, meet the energy harvesting requirement for ERs, under the assumption that the AN can be canceled at IRs but not at ERs. Specifically, the proposed scheme splits the transmit power into two parts: to send the confidential message to the IR and an AN to interfere with the ER, respectively. Under a simplified three-node wiretap channel setup, the transmit power allocations and power splitting ratios over fading channels are jointly optimized to minimize the outage probability for delay-limited secrecy information transmission or to maximize the average rate for no-delay-limited secrecy information transmission, subject to a combination of average and peak power constraints (APC and PPC) at the transmitter (Tx) and an average energy harvesting constraint at the ER. Both the secrecy outage probability minimization and average rate maximization problems are shown to be nonconvex, and for each, the authors propose the optimal solution based on the dual decomposition and the suboptimal solution based on the alternating optimization. Furthermore, two benchmark schemes are introduced for comparison where the AN is not used at the Tx and where the AN is used but cannot be canceled by the IR, respectively. Finally, the performances of proposed schemes are evaluated by simulations in terms of various tradeoffs for wireless (secrecy) information versus energy transmissions."
1194739,13990,10228,Interference aware throughput measurements for mobile WiMAX over vehicular radio channels,2012,"Due to its advantageous properties in multipath propagation scenarios, the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) radio transmission scheme is widely spread in current broadband wireless networks. Exemplary emerging systems based on this technology are the UMTS Long Term Evolution (LTE), Mobile WiMAX and some popular WiFi variants (e.g. IEEE 802.11n). Although analytical and simulative investigations have shown that the increased symbol time of OFDMA (compared with single carrier systems) allows for a wider delay spread without causing Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) it is quite hard to quantify this improvement under realistic circumstances. In this paper, we present the results of a measurement campaign in which we investigated the influence of multipath fading channels, interferences and velocity on the available User Datagram Protocol (UDP) data rate of an IEEE 802.16e conform Mobile WiMAX System. Therefore, a sophisticated laboratory setup was used which is based on a radio channel emulator. From that, optimum switching points for the Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) scheme are derived. The results show, that for vehicular radio channels the choice of the most suitable modulation and coding scheme, and therefore the maximum available data rate, does strongly depend on the environmental parameter such as delay spread and user velocity. In particular, it can be seen that the use of a strong forward error correction is more important than a higher order modulation scheme if high data rates are required by real time multimedia applications."
422512,13990,21066,Energy-optimal collaborative GPS localization with short range communication,2013,"The key issue of the localization study is that how we can minimize the energy consumption of devices with guaranteeing high degree of accuracy. In this paper, we show that the collaboration among proxy devices with short range communication is helpful to energy-efficiently localize their locations in time-average sense by analyzing the device proximity including real GPS trace of students in KAIST and NCSU campuses. Next, we deliberate what is the best method for selfish mobile users to collaborate for the energy-efficient localization, and formulate an optimization problem which considers the energy efficiency and/or user fairness. However, optimizing this problem is tricky since it requires a global knowledge of sets of proxy devices and also solving a NP-hard problem to select devices which directly measure locations. This paper makes a contribution towards presenting a practical and fully distributed location sharing protocol based on competition for turning off GPS, and an optimal algorithm which controls mean waiting time used for the competition. Through the extensive simulations under several sample topologies and real mobility trace in KAIST campus, we obtain the following interesting observations: (i) (in sample topologies) our scheme achieves a near-optimal performance of proposed problem in terms of energy efficiency and fairness (up to 27.2% power saving with 35.8% higher fairness than existing heuristic algorithms), (ii) (in real mobility trace) our scheme well adapts at even unpredictably changing mobility environment (65.5% power saving than no collaboration, 27.4% or more power saving with 25% higher fairness than the existing algorithms)."
1310459,13990,8228,Internet routing diversity for stub networks with a Map-and-Encap scheme,2012,"Routing diversity has been identified as essential for network robustness and traffic engineering. The Internet possesses by its very nature a large path diversity. However this diversity cannot be fully exploited due to BGP limitations, which only keeps one single route for each available prefix. Despite some previous works in the area, no operational and non-disruptive architecture have been proposed yet to allow the networks to better exploit Internet path diversity. This paper proposes one step in this direction, focusing on the interconnection between an Autonomous System (AS) and its Internet Service Provider (ISP). We propose the use of a so-called “Map-and-Encap” scheme to bypass current BGP limitations in order to use arbitrary paths. With this scheme, an ISP may propose its rich path diversity (at least partially) to its customers, in order to perform advanced traffic engineering (e.g. fast recovery, load balancing…) based on richer and more flexible path selection policies (e.g., considering price, performance or stability of routes). To assess the potential benefits of the proposed architecture, we evaluate the potential route diversity that a Tier 1 may offer to its stub clients, based on different possible route selection policies (i.e. which routes are offered to its customers). We also analyze the overhead that is created at the control-plane (routing updates received by the mapping database) and that may impact the data-plane (path changes that may be caused by some route withdrawals/updates). Our evaluation shows that the increase in diversity has a controllable and acceptable overhead. It also gives some insights into efficient deployment strategies."
1468313,13990,23712,Circular Pipelining: Minimizing Round-Trip Delay in Low-Duty-Cycle Wireless Networks,2014,"In wireless networks, duty-cycling operations have been widely used to reduce the energy cost of RF idle listening at wireless receivers. Such operations, however, introduce delays in data forwarding because a sender has to wait for a targeted receiver to wake up. To reduce end-to-end delivery delays, researchers have proposed scheduling techniques [1], [2], [3] to wake up nodes along the data forwarding path at the right moment. However, these techniques consider only one-way delivery from a sink to nodes (or vice versa), failing to optimally support round-trip network operations such as (i) query and response, (ii) command and control and (iii) data fetching. In this work, we interestingly reveal that the optimal roundtrip delay in a low-duty-cycle network depends only on (i) duty cycle period and (ii) the number of 2-connected network components between the source and destination nodes. We prove that optimality in the round-trip delay can be achieved by establishing a simple circular path and its related cords, in which nodes are assigned wake-up slots in an ascending order in each network component, and connecting these paths into a circular pipeline. We compared our Circular Pipelining (CP) algorithm with the state-of-art solutions [3], and the experimental results show that without using circular forwarding, existing solutions have a round-trip delay proportional to the network diameter, while CP remains a minimal constant delay of T as long as the network is 2-connected. We also implement the Circular Pipelining (CP) algorithm in a test bed consisting of 30 MICAz nodes, achieving significant delay reduction compared to three baseline solutions in the literature."
1364310,13990,22021,On the vector broadcast channel with alternating CSIT: A topological perspective,2014,"In many wireless networks, link strengths are affected by many topological factors such as different distances, shadowing and inter-cell interference, thus resulting in some links being generally stronger than other links. From an information theoretic point of view, accounting for such topological aspects has remained largely unexplored, despite strong indications that such aspects can crucially affect transceiver and feedback design, as well as the overall performance. #R##N#The work here takes a step in exploring this interplay between topology, feedback and performance. This is done for the two user broadcast channel with random fading, in the presence of a simple two-state topological setting of statistically strong vs. weaker links, and in the presence of a practical ternary feedback setting of alternating channel state information at the transmitter (alternating CSIT) where for each channel realization, this CSIT can be perfect, delayed, or not available. #R##N#In this setting, the work derives generalized degrees-of-freedom bounds and exact expressions, that capture performance as a function of feedback statistics and topology statistics. The results are based on novel topological signal management (TSM) schemes that account for topology in order to fully utilize feedback. This is achieved for different classes of feedback mechanisms of practical importance, from which we identify specific feedback mechanisms that are best suited for different topologies. This approach offers further insight on how to split the effort --- of channel learning and feeding back CSIT --- for the strong versus for the weaker link. Further intuition is provided on the possible gains from topological spatio-temporal diversity, where topology changes in time and across users."
1905596,13990,22164,From homogeneous to heterogeneous networks: A 3GPP Long Term Evolution rel. 8/9 case study,2011,"Heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets)—conventional macro base stations overlaid with low-power nodes—are being deployed for reasons of improved spectral efficiency, economy, and scalable network expansion. To optimally realize the benefits of HetNets, it is crucial to factor deployment aspects such as cell association, transmission power, spectrum allocation, and deployment density. This paper presents comprehensive dynamic system level simulations based on the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard modeling spatial, temporal, and frequency domain channel variations and ray-tracing based penetration losses in urban and indoor environments. The simulator takes into account the dynamic (subframe level) modulation and coding scheme and precoder selection, as well as finite rate channel state feedback and transmission aspects intrinsic to LTE. Considering a Rel. 8/9 LTE HetNet, two access schemes are analyzed: first, open access picocells, where results show that a single picocell can double the area spectral efficiency without any impairment of the macro-layer, and second, closed access femtocells, where results show that in typical scenarios, the user throughput is deteriorated on both the macro-layer and the femto-layer. Consequently, open access low-power nodes can be deployed as is, whilst closed access ones require additional interference avoidance mechanisms. These dynamic system level simulations are important for deriving accurate and practically relevant performance trade-offs, while commensurate with the time and frequency granularity of LTE."
2225281,13990,9015,Lifestreams: a modular sense-making toolset for identifying important patterns from everyday life,2013,"Smartphones can capture diverse spatio-temporal data about an individual; including both intermittent self-report, and continuous passive data collection from onboard sensors and applications. The resulting  personal data streams  can support powerful inference about the user's state, behavior, well-being and environment. However making sense and acting on these multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data streams requires iterative and intensive exploration of the datasets, and development of customized analysis techniques that are appropriate for a particular health domain.   Lifestreams is a modular and extensible open-source data analysis stack designed to facilitate the exploration and evaluation of personal data stream sense-making. Lifestreams analysis modules include: feature extraction from raw data; feature selection; pattern and trend inference; and interactive visualization. The system was iteratively designed during a 6-month pilot in which 44 young mothers used an open-source participatory mHealth platform to record both self-report and passive data about their diet, stress and exercise. Feedback as participants and the study coordinator attempted to use the Lifestreams dashboard to make sense of their data collected during this intensive study were critical inputs into the design process. In order to explore the generality and extensibility of Lifestreams pipeline, it was then applied to two additional studies with different datasets, including a continuous stream of audio data, self-report data, and mobile system analytics. In all three studies, Lifestreams' integrated analysis pipeline was able to identify key behaviors and trends in the data that were not otherwise identified by participants."
1199899,13990,8228,Coping with physical attacks on random network structures,2014,"Communication networks are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as earthquakes or floods, as well as to physical attacks, such as an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) attack. Such real-world events happen at specific geographical locations and disrupt specific parts of the network. Therefore, the geographical layout of the network determines the impact of such events on the network's physical topology in terms of capacity, connectivity, and flow. #R##N#Recent works focused on assessing the vulnerability of a deterministic network to such events. In this work, we focus on assessing the vulnerability of (geographical) random networks to such disasters. We consider stochastic graph models in which nodes and links are probabilistically distributed on a plane, and model the disaster event as a circular cut that destroys any node or link within or intersecting the circle. #R##N#We develop algorithms for assessing the damage of both targeted and non-targeted (random) attacks and determining which attack locations have the expected most disruptive impact on the network. Then, we provide experimental results for assessing the impact of circular disasters to communications networks in the USA, where the network's geographical layout was modeled probabilistically, relying on demographic information only. Our results demonstrates the applicability of our algorithms to real-world scenarios. #R##N#Our algorithms allows to examine how valuable is public information about the network's geographical area (e.g., demography, topography, economy) to an attacker's destruction assessment capabilities in the case the network's physical topology is hidden or examine the affect of hiding the actual physical location of the fibers on the attack strategy. Thereby, our schemes can be used as a tool for policy makers and engineers to design more robust networks and identifying locations which require additional protection efforts."
2505428,13990,8839,Zee: zero-effort crowdsourcing for indoor localization,2012,"Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting, based onWiFi or cellular signals, has been a popular approach to indoor localization. However, its adoption in the real world has been stymied by the need for sitespecific calibration, i.e., the creation of a training data set comprising WiFi measurements at known locations in the space of interest. While efforts have been made to reduce this calibration effort using modeling, the need for measurements from known locations still remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we present Zee -- a system that makes the calibration zero-effort, by enabling training data to be crowdsourced without any explicit effort on the part of users. Zee leverages the inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, compass, gyroscope) present in the mobile devices such as smartphones carried by users, to track them as they traverse an indoor environment, while simultaneously performing WiFi scans. Zee is designed to run in the background on a device without requiring any explicit user participation. The only site-specific input that Zee depends on is a map showing the pathways (e.g., hallways) and barriers (e.g., walls). A significant challenge that Zee surmounts is to track users without any a priori, user-specific knowledge such as the user's initial location, stride-length, or phone placement. Zee employs a suite of novel techniques to infer location over time: (a) placement-independent step counting and orientation estimation, (b) augmented particle filtering to simultaneously estimate location and user-specific walk characteristics such as the stride length,(c) back propagation to go back and improve the accuracy of ocalization in the past, and (d) WiFi-based particle initialization to enable faster convergence. We present an evaluation of Zee in a large office building."
640063,13990,23827,A publish/subscribe system using distributed broker for SOA based MANET applications,2012,"Due to advances of network enabled wireless devices, there is a growing trend of the use of networked and distributed mobile devices. As a result, deployment of day to day applications in MANET for information services is also rapidly evolving in ad hoc mobile environments, with the growing number of mobile users. The application running on different devices can be accessed as a service by different users on an on demand basis. These scenario demands deployment of Service Oriented Architecture SOA in MANET for efficient access and usage of applications. Since nodes in MANET does not have any prior knowledge about other nodes, in many cases, the publish/subscribe communication paradigm that has the decoupling and asynchrony properties can be useful to share services between nodes. Unfortunately, none of the currently available content-based publish-subscribe system fit the requirements of such dynamic environments. In this paper several distributed publish/subscribe mechanisms for improving the reliability of the service discovery process is analyzed. Nodes in MANET are constrained by limited processing power, battery power, memory etc, so there lays a need to find appropriate nodes for service brokering. To select a broker for publishing services, parameters like available battery power, CPU power, memory capacity, nodes mobility etc. needs to be considered. In this paper a broker selection model based on the above mentioned parameters is proposed. Unlike other mobility prediction algorithms in terms of speed which require devices to be equipped with GPS to predict the mobility, mobility in the proposed algorithm is detected using frequent change of neighborhood."
840628,13990,8228,Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) adaptive estimation and prediction schemes using superimposed and decomposed channel tracking,2013,"Performance of future wireless technologies will depend heavily on cooperation between different transmission/reception nodes in the access network. CoMP (Coordinated Multi-Point) transmission increases the cell edge user performance by reducing the inter-cell interference. UEs (User Equipments) simultaneously receive data from multiple base stations (eNBs) grouped into a joint transmission cluster. Clustering choices need to be optimized by joint use of CoMP adaptive channel estimation and prediction schemes for energy efficiency and capacity improvements. In this paper, various multi-point (multi-eNB) channel estimation/prediction schemes are proposed and analyzed to improve the joint transmission set clustering accuracy. Multi-point CIRs (Channel Impulse Responses) can be tracked either by superimposed or decomposed methods. The latter scheme tracks each multipath component of every CoMP measurement set member and yields more accurate estimates, however leads to significantly higher computation complexity as opposed to the superimposed tracking which tracks the overall CIR. Therefore, UEs need to dynamically switch between the two schemes depending on the serving cluster size and recently observed CoMP characteristics. It is shown that increasing the channel estimation/prediction filter size yields significantly more capacity and energy efficiency improvements for UEs served by larger clusters. It is also demonstrated that the serving eNB can maximize the performance gains by setting the channel prediction range equal to observed system delay between the multi-point CSI reports and data transmission."
1865183,13990,369,Joint Application of Spread Spectrum and OFDM Modulation for Microwave Radio Communication Used for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,2011,"The wireless communication system used by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle has special requirements. Two separate data streams are used, one for telemetry and control of the vehicle, and one for payload. The first stream is of relatively low data rate, but must be very robust. The second stream requires high data rate, but a best effort approach is acceptable. Real-time remote control usage mandates low response time (turn around latency) of the system, which demands small frames and frequent direction changes over the half duplex channel. These two different requirements must be accounted for in the design of the modulation system. In this paper our solution based on the joint application of a chirp spread spectrum modulation with a correlator based demodulator for the telemetry and control data stream and a high data rate orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation for the payload is presented. The OFDM communication occupies the same bandwidth as the spread spectrum modulation, but - unlike the Chirp signal - utilizes its full bandwidth. By using a correlation detector for all timing recovery tasks and keeping the same timing for the OFDM part of the frame, all control loops normally needed for this task (symbol synchronization PLL, COSTAS loop) can be eliminated. This results in the whole signal processing path being a finite impulse response system which aids us in a highly pipelineable design implementation and makes it possible to create a high speed implementation with a low-end field programmable gate array (FPGA) circuit."
2032966,13990,22021,Computing a k-sparse n-length Discrete Fourier Transform using at most 4k samples and O(k log k) complexity,2013,"Given an n-length input signal x, it is well known that its Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), X, can be computed in O(nlogn) complexity using a Fast Fourier Transform. If the spectrum X is exactly k-sparse (where k  δ  where 0 <; δ <; 1), and the support of the non-zero DFT coefficients is uniformly random, we can exploit this sparsity in two fundamental ways (i) sample complexity: we need only M = rk deterministically chosen samples of the input signal x (where r <; 4 when 0 <; δ <; 0.99); and (ii) computational complexity: we can reliably compute the DFT X using O(k log k) operations, where the constants in the big Oh are small. Our algorithm succeeds with high probability, with the probability of failure vanishing to zero asymptotically in the number of samples acquired, M. Our approach is based on filterless subsampling of the input signal x using a small set of carefully chosen uniform subsampling patterns guided by the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Specifically, our subsampling operation on x is designed to create aliasing patterns on the spectrum X that look like parity-check constraints of good erasure-correcting sparse-graph codes. We show how computing the sparse DFT X is equivalent to decoding of these sparse-graph codes and is low in both sample complexity and decoding complexity. We accordingly dub our algorithm the FFAST (Fast Fourier Aliasing-based Sparse Transform) algorithm. In our analysis, we rigorously connect our CRT based graph constructions to random sparse-graph codes based on a balls-and-bins model and analyze the convergence behavior of the latter using well-studied density evolution techniques from coding theory. We provide simulation results in Section IV that corroborate our theoretical findings, and validate the empirical performance of the FFAST algorithm."
2038136,13990,8839,SimpleMAC: a jamming-resilient MAC-layer protocol for wireless channel coordination,2012,"In wireless networks, users share a transmission medium. To increase the efficiency of channel usage, wireless systems often use a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol to perform channel coordination by having each node announce its usage intentions; other nodes avoid making conflicting transmissions minimizing interference both to the node that has announced its intentions and to a node that cooperates by avoiding transmissions during the reserved slot. Traditionally, in a multi-channel environment, such announcements are made on a common control channel. However, this control channel is vulnerable to jamming because its location is pre-assigned and known to attackers. Furthermore, the announcements themselves provide information useful for jamming. In this paper, we focus on a situation where multiple wireless transmitters share spectrum in the presence of intelligent and possibly insider jammers capable of dynamically and adaptively changing their jamming patterns.   We develop a framework for effectively countering MAC-aware jamming attacks and then propose SimpleMAC, a protocol resilient to these attacks. SimpleMAC consists of two schemes (the  Simple Transmitter Strategy  and the  Simple Signaling Scheme ) that are easily analyzed using game theory, and show the optimal adversarial behavior under these protocols. We evaluate our schemes mathematically, through Monte Carlo simulations, and by implementation on the WARP software-defined radio platform. SimpleMAC provides very rapid improvement over the alternative of not using any MAC protocol, and eventually converges to optimal performance (over six-fold improvement in SINR, 50% gains in Shannon capacity in a realistic mobile scenario)."
2324016,13990,8228,Survivable Optical Grid Dimensioning: Anycast Routing with Server and Network Failure Protection,2011,"Grids can efficiently deal with challenging computational and data processing tasks which cutting edge science is generating today. So-called e-Science grids cope with these complex task by deploying geographically distributed server infrastructure, interconnected by high speed networks. The latter benefit from optical technology, offering low latencies and high bandwidths, thus giving rise to so-called optical grids or lambda grids. In this paper, we address the dimensioning problem of such grids: how to decide how much server infrastructure to deploy, at which locations in a given topology, the amount of network capacity to provide and which routes to follow along them. Compared to earlier work, we propose an integrated solution solving these questions in an integrated way, i.e., we jointly optimize network and server capacity, and incorporate resiliency against both network and server failures. Assuming we are given the amount of resource reservation requests arriving at each network node (where a resource reservation implies to reserve both processing capacity at a server site, and a network connection towards it), we solve the problem of first choosing a predetermined number of server locations to use, and subsequently determine the routes to follow while minimizing resource requirements. In a case study on a meshed European network comprising 28 nodes and 41 links, we show that compared to classical (i.e. without relocation) shared path protection against link failures only, we can offer resilience against both single link and network failures by adding about 55% extra server capacity, and 26% extra wavelengths."
1018193,13990,369,An Efficient Reduced-Complexity Two-Stage Differential Sliding Correlation Approach for OFDM Synchronization in the AWGN Channel,2011,"In this paper, we propose a new scheme for data- aided time and frequency synchronization for OFDM systems, based on a single-symbol preamble. The preamble, of useful length $2^{m}-2$, is composed of two consecutive identical m-sequences (with length $2^{m-1}-1$ each). This preamble is extended by a cyclic prefix of convenient length. This stucture is adequate for a two-stage synchronization scheme, namely a reduced complexity coarse synchronization stage, followed by a finer synchronization one. The first stage, based on Cox and Schmidl-like sliding correlation, determines a reduced uncertainty interval over which the fine stage is carried. The second stage is indeed based on a differential correlation, which is more complex compared to the first stage. The combined use of m-sequences and differential correlation offers an almost perfect peak of the computed metric at the preamble start. To assess the performance degradation occasioned by the reduction of complexity characterizing the proposed two-stage approach, we also consider the brute force single-stage approach, where differential correlation is exclusively used. As a byproduct of our two-stage approach, the fractional frequency offset is estimated and its performance is assessed and compared for both two- stage and one-stage approaches. The brute force approach outperfoms all the considered benchmarks. Compared to the reduced complexity scheme, the brute force one provides similar performance, at the expense of a significant complexity overload. Only for SNR lower than $-5$ dB, the brute force scheme presents a slight enhancement with respect to the reduced complexity one. The simulation results show that the proposed method gives better performance than any other considered estimator. Although our technique is expected to be well suited to multipath channels, thanks to the underlying properties of m-sequences, in this paper we focus on the Additive White Gaussian Noise channel."
715726,13990,8228,Coordinated dual-layer beamforming for public safety network: Architecture and algorithms,2012,"The revolutionary success of commercial broadband wireless network has spurred significant interest in employing related technologies such as 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) technologies to build a nationwide mobile broadband network for public safety entities. The successful deployment and operation of a public safety network, however, are more challenging than the traditional commercial wireless networks due to the high reliability and security requirements, unpredictable traffic patterns, and fast time-varying user population density. In this paper, we propose a framework of coordinated dual-layer beamforming schemes to address these challenges. The distinct features of the proposed systems are detailed and the architecture and realization are discussed. While a smart antenna is capable of forming multiple beams, it is unlikely to activate all of them simultaneously. We thus develop efficient beam scheduling algorithms that could adapt to the time-varying channel conditions and traffic loads by adaptively adjusting the beam switching sequence. We also reveal that the coordinated dual-layer beamforming technologie not only has the potential of significantly enhancing the system capacity, but also can turn a NP-complete beam scheduling problem into a problem that can be easily solved if network MIMO technologies are employed. It is seen through simulation studies that the proposed schemes could offer multi-fold capacity improvements over more traditional systems equipped with broader antenna patterns (e.g., omnidirectional). Also, while we focus on public safety network in this paper, the proposed coordinated dual-layer beamforming framework can be equally applied to provide mobile access to any hotspot area with dense mobile users, e.g., a conference room or a stadium."
868674,13990,10228,Self-organizing fractional frequency reuse for femtocells using adaptive frequency hopping,2013,"In this paper, an adaptive and self-organizing spectrum allocation policy for ad hoc femtocells in two-tier networks based on usage of random frequency hopping is presented. As femto- and macrocells normally share the same frequency resources, the proposed approach is able to minimize InterCell Interference (ICI) in an adaptive manner. Each femto- and macrocell user chooses random carrier frequencies for transmission corresponding to a given probability density function (pdf). If the level of interference reaches a certain limit, which is typically the case for femtocell edge users, the probability density function of the carrier frequencies is changed in a way that it is quasi-orthogonal to the one of the macrocell users nearby. The changeover point between different probability density functions is realized in a self-organizing manner regarding the detected level of interference. Hence, the approach is able to adjust the trade-off between spectral efficiency and introduced interference during operation. We present analytical models for the Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise-Ratio (SINR), the Bit Error Ratio (BER) and the required transmission power of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) femtocells applying adaptive random frequency hopping. The mobile radio channel is characterized by non-frequency selective Rayleigh fading and all results are verified by simulations implemented in MATLAB. In order to evaluate the improvements, the results are compared to systems using centralized orthogonal planning, systems using neither centralized nor distributed planning, and systems using static random frequency hopping. The comparison shows that adaptive random frequency hopping is capable of reducing the BER by a factor of 15 and the transmission power of femtocells by 17 dBm compared to systems where the macrocell user transmits in the same subbands as the femtocell user."
1151742,13990,10192,Measuring the Impact of the Mobile Radio Channel on the Energy Efficiency of LTE User Equipment,2012,"The energy that has to be spent for the successful submission of one Bit is an important figure of merit for the performance analysis and optimization of modern wireless communication systems. The many factors which are influencing this performance parameter range from the efficiency of the User Equipment's (UE) power amplifier to the average path loss, the Transmit Power Control (TPC) parametrization and the fading characteristics of the radio channel. Although many of the relationships can be analytically modeled, the aim of this paper is to present reliable measurements based on commercially available Long Term Evolution (LTE) hardware. Therefore, extensive User Datagram Protocol (UDP) data rate measurements have been performed in a mobile communications laboratory for different radio channel conditions. The impact of the mobile fading channel was emulated by a sophisticated radio channel emulator. Beside this, the on average consumed power of the LTE UE was measured during data transmission. From the results of these measurements, quantitative figures on the energy efficiency are presented for different LTE frequency bands and different radio channels. The results show that major energy savings are possible if the 800 MHz frequency band, which becomes available as part of the digital dividend, can be used for user with bad channel conditions. Considering energy efficiency as a Quality of Service (QoS) parameter of increasing importance the results presented in this paper allow for a context sensitive optimization in a way that the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) switching points as well as the frequency band are chosen with respect to the UE's condition."
1683909,13990,369,Efficient IP Mobility Management for Green Optical and Wireless Converged Access Networks,2012,"- During off-peak hours of a day, when incoming and outgoing traffic arrival rate used to be low, a Mobile Terminal (MT) can stay in idle mode for long time. For tracking the idle MTs, a wireless access network invokes them to conduct location update whenever they enter into a new location. This allows the network to route a call successfully. To provide any IP packet based service, Mobile IP (MIP) is very important protocol undeniably. However, Proxy Mobile IP was developed by IETF without considering idle mode condition of MTs. Consequently, an idle MT needs to conduct MIP binding (Layer 3 location update) whenever it moves to a new area of a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) although it does not have any incoming or outgoing packets during idle periods. This phenomenon unnecessarily increases location update signaling cost. In our previous work, we proposed a mechanism using which only Layer 2 location update is needed when an MT is in idle mode and the Layer 3 location update is conducted after a call arrives for an idle MT in Optical and Wireless Converged Access Networks (OWCAN). This allows saving energy in the mobility management nodes (e.g. MAG, Base Stations) significantly. Based on our previous work, in this paper we propose a novel algorithm for the Optical Network Units (ONUs) of an OWCAN. This algorithm decides when to interrupt modules of a sleeping ONU to wake up and which frames should be forwarded for uplink transmission. We have found that adopting this algorithm an ONU of an OWCAN can save energy significantly. Therefore, our solutions mainly contribute in two-fold to make a green OWCAN. First, it minimizes energy consumption in the mobility management nodes. Second, our solution also reduces energy consumption and improves bandwidth utilization in the optical backhaul."
2424972,13990,20348,Error-resilient and complexity-constrained distributed coding for large scale sensor networks,2012,"ABSTRACT There has been considerable interest in distributed source coding within the compression and sensor network research communities in recent years, primarily due to its potential contributions to low-power sensor networks. However, two major obstacles pose an existential threat on practical deployment of such techniques in real world sensor networks, namely, the exponential growth of decoding complexity with network size and coding rates, and the critical requirement for error-resilience given the severe channel conditions in many wireless sensor networks. Motivated by these chal-lenges, this paper proposes a novel, unified approach for large scale, error-resilient distributed source coding, based on an optimally designed classifier-based decoding frame-work, where the design explicitly controls the decoding com-plexity. We also present a deterministic annealing (DA) based global optimization algorithm for the design due to the highly non-convex nature of the cost function, which further enhances the performance over basic greedy iterative descent technique. Simulation results on data, both synthetic and from real sensor networks, provide strong evidence that the approach opens the door to practical deployment of distributed coding in large sensor networks. It not only yields substantial gains in terms of overall distortion, compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, but also demonstrates how its decoder naturally scales to large networks while constraining the complexity, thereby enabling performance gains that increase with network size."
1198290,13990,369,Multi-BS Cooperative Interference Control for LTE Systems,2012,"Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) is attracting attention recently. In ICIC, cell-edge throughput can be improved by preventing BSs from transmitting signals (hereafter, muting BSs), and the information exchange among BSs is little because each UE is only served by a BS at any instant. However, when a BS is muted, no radio resource is allocated to UEs belonging to the muted BS while UEs belonging to other BSs enjoy high cell-edge throughput. Therefore, there is a possibility that overall cell performance may degrade. To prevent this, we propose a multi-BS cooperative interference control method. The basic concept of the proposed method is that the muting is triggered only when the total throughput of the cooperation area is increased by the muting compared to the total throughput possible without muting. The proposed method makes it possible to increase cell-edge throughput without degrading overall cell performance. We also propose a way to realize this interference control on practical systems. First, we propose a way to realized it on 3GPP Release 8 LTE systems. In the proposed interference control, it is important to estimate throughput (SINR) values with and without muting appropriately. We propose to utilize feedback signals defined in LTE such as Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) and Received Signal Received Power (RSRP) to achieve the accurate throughput estimation. Furthermore, we propose to realize the proposed interference control on a distributed sector configuration using optical fiber systems such as Radio over Fiber (RoF) or Remote Radio Head (RRH). With this configuration, it is possible to achieve ICIC with less burden of information exchange. Especially with three sector configuration, it is possible to achieve inter-cell cooperation with inter-sector cooperation, which can be easily implemented."
1099024,13990,8228,Modeling the impact of VANET-enabled traffic lights control on the response time of emergency vehicles in realistic large-scale urban area,2013,"In the last decade, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have progressed at a rapid rate, which aim to improve transportation activities in terms of safety and efficiency. Car-to-car and car-to-infrastructure communications are important components of the ITS architecture. Communication between cars and traffic lights is one of the important V2I applications which helps to have dynamic and automatic traffic lights that can create several benefits such as minimizing the traffic jam, reducing fuel consumption and emissions, etc. This paper deals with decreasing the response time of the emergency cars by changing the traffic lights status with employing the communication technologies. The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, the effect of the changing traffic lights status to green for emergency cars is investigated by using traffic simulator (SUMO). Second, this paper uses OMNET++ (Network Simulator) in order to simulate the mentioned scenario as a VANET (with 802.11p standard) by using Veins framework to run SUMO and OMNET++ in parallel. This study has developed the Veins framework by adding a new module to OMNET++ to consider the traffic lights which are simulated in SUMO. Moreover this study has developed a new program written in Python which is connected to SUMO and controls the traffic simulation. This program uses SUMO to simulate a microscopic traffic (by considering every single vehicle movements) and also a city with intelligent traffic lights. Additionally, several statistics about traffic simulation is created for each car such as traveling time, waiting time, emissions, fuel consumption; or complete amount of car emissions in the street during the simulation, fuel consumption, number of vehicles and so on, for each street. This paper uses Manhattan realistic map to describe the mentioned program, then uses realistic map and realistic traffic demand of Cologne, Germany, to obtain a realistic and reliable result."
2923377,13990,8228,CPRI compression transport for LTE and LTE-A signal in C-RAN,2012,"C-RAN is the next-generation clean wireless access network architecture, which is based on centralized processing, the Collaborative Radio and Real-time Cloud Infrastructure. In C-RAN architecture, different access technology (eg.GSM / TD-SCDMA / WCDMA / LTE) can be support on the same hardware platform in baseband pool system; C-RAN can be applied to reduce the consumption of operators. LTE (Long Term Evolution) and LTE-A, which are based on OFDM and MIMO technologies, are regarded as the main wireless access technology in the evolution from 3G to 4G. LTE introduces variety of novel technologies to improve the system performance, especially in C-RAN architecture, such as Multi antennas MIMO, Carrier Aggregation, CoMP. However, C -RAN architecture also brings about lager data transmission in the optical fiber. In this paper a low-latency baseband signal compression algorithm used in ALU is introduced to reduce the data rate. Based on the Characteristics of LTE signal data, the algorithm removal redundancies in the spectral domain firstly, and then the block scaling, which is combined with non-linear (nonuniform) quantizer, is designed to minimize quantization error. This algorithm can effectively reduce the amount of data transferred between BBU and RUU in LTE system, to facilitate the deployment of LTE in the CRan architecture. Simulation analysis is given out in the paper; meanwhile TD-LTE system demo verification is also implemented. The results indicate that the scheme introduced can get good performance under a certain compression rate in the real system. Further research is also in progress."
2384332,13990,22260,Marina-Scale Water Temperature Sensing in Real Time Using Microtomography,2011,"Small scale marine environments (bays, channels, estuaries, marinas, etc.) are dynamic environments where diverse flora and fauna come into close contact with man-made processes. Yet water temperature monitoring of these coastal environments is usually spatially sparse due to the cost of acquiring, deploying and maintaining buoys. In this paper we introduce micro tomography: using precise time-of-flight calculations for acoustic signals sent over short distances (50 m) to measure water temperature. The traditional use of the technology is to construct low resolution temperature and current maps of large bodies of water useful for global climate study, however here we apply the key concepts to a sensor network to enable real-time monitoring of water temperature while also improving the spatial resolution of the data. As we use time-of-flight measurements to accomplish our goal, high precision and tight time synchronization are required of the network in order to produce meaningful temperature maps. On the other hand, the reduced scale introduces a new opportunity to utilize the technology to sense even the slightest change in temperature. To show our system is realizable we present our prototype underwater acoustic sensor nodes and experimental results that indicates a temperature resolution of approximately one-tenth of a degree Celsius. We also present our micro-tomography simulation software. With the simulator we can study the feasibility of building a more complex marina-scale tomography system and the requirements that must be met by the underlying sensor network."
2475275,13990,22260,DMap: A Shared Hosting Scheme for Dynamic Identifier to Locator Mappings in the Global Internet,2012,"This paper presents the design and evaluation of a novel distributed shared hosting approach, DMap, for managing dynamic identifier to locator mappings in the global Internet. DMap is the foundation for a fast global name resolution service necessary to enable emerging Internet services such as seamless mobility support, content delivery and cloud computing. Our approach distributes identifier to locator mappings among Autonomous Systems (ASs) by directly applying K>1 consistent hash functions on the identifier to produce network addresses of the AS gateway routers at which the mapping will be stored. This direct mapping technique leverages the reach ability information of the underlying routing mechanism that is already available at the network layer, and achieves low lookup latencies through a single overlay hop without additional maintenance overheads. The proposed DMap technique is described in detail and specific design problems such as address space fragmentation, reducing latency through replication, taking advantage of spatial locality, as well as coping with inconsistent entries are addressed. Evaluation results are presented from a large-scale discrete event simulation of the Internet with ~26,000 ASs using real-world traffic traces from the DIMES repository. The results show that the proposed method evenly balances storage load across the global network while achieving lookup latencies with a mean value of ~50 ms and 95th percentile value of ~100 ms, considered adequate for support of dynamic mobility across the global Internet."
1515602,13990,10162,"Privacy, quality of information, and energy consumption in Participatory Sensing systems",2014,"Participatory Sensing (PS) is a new data collection paradigm based on the voluntary participation of many cellular users equipped with smart applications, a large diversity of sensors, and Internet connectivity at all times. Although many PS-based applications can be foreseen to solve interesting and useful problems, many of them have not been fully implemented and used in practice because of privacy concerns. Compounding the problem, privacy-preserving mechanisms introduce additional issues. For example, one of the most important problems is that of the quality of the information provided by the PS system to the final users. The problem is that, in order to protect the privacy of the users, most privacy-preserving mechanisms modify their real locations, which makes the reported data as if it had been measured from a different location, introducing noise or false information in the system and to the final users. Another important problem is that of the energy consumption. Privacy-preserving mechanisms consume extra energy and users are not very willing to use PS applications if they drain their batteries considerably faster. This paper proposes a hybrid privacy-preserving mechanism that combines anonymization, data obfuscation, and encryption techniques to increase the quality of information and privacy protection without increasing the energy consumption in a significant manner. A new algorithm is proposed that dynamically changes the cell sizes of the grid of the area of interest according to the variability of the variable of interest being measured and chooses different privacy-preserving mechanisms depending on the size of the cell. In small cells, where users can be identified easier, the algorithm uses encryption techniques to protect the privacy of the users and increase the quality of the information, as the reported location is the real location. On the other hand, anonymization and data obfuscation techniques are used in bigger cells where the variability of the variable of interest is low and therefore it is more important to protect the real location (privacy) of the user. We evaluated our hybrid approach and other privacy-preserving mechanisms using a real PS system for air pollution monitoring. Our experiments show the better performance of the proposed hybrid mechanism and the existing trade-offs in terms of privacy, quality of information to the final user, and energy consumption."
2440428,13990,23653,"Multiple target counting and tracking using binary proximity sensors: bounds, coloring, and filter",2014,"Binary proximity sensors (BPS) provide extremely low cost and privacy preserving features for tracking mobile targets in smart environment, but great challenges are posed for track- ing multiple targets, because a BPS cannot distinguish one or multiple targets are in its sensing range. In this paper, we at first address the counting problem by presenting a maxi- mum clique partition model on unit disk graph, which leads to a tight lower bound for estimating the number of targets by a snapshot of sensor readings. Then, to more accurately count and track the multiple targets by sequential readings of sensors, we state the key is to comprehensively infer the states behind the events. Therefore, at each event we infer which target may trigger the event via a dynamic coloring technique (DEC) and predict the potential regions of the multiple targets by a colorful area shrinking and expanding approach. Such an approach generates multiple potential scenarios containing different colors to interpret the sequen- tial events, where the number of colors indicates the different estimations of the target number. Then we designed multi- color particle filter (MCPF), which is run in parallel in each scenario to enumerate and evaluate the potential trajecto- ries of the targets under the color constraint. The likelihoods of the trajectories are evaluated by each target's movement consistence. The overall best trajectory over all scenarios is voted to provide not only the most possible target number, but also the trajectories of the targets. Extensive simula- tions were conducted using a multi-agent simulator which show good accuracy of the proposed multi-target tracking algorithms."
936480,13990,22021,Achieving the Holevo capacity of a pure state classical-quantum channel via unambiguous state discrimination,2013,"We prove that the ultimate channel capacity, the Holevo bound, for sending classical data on a quantum channel (the so-called classical-quantum, or cq channel) can be achieved for a pure-state cq channel by decoding codewords via a collective quantum measurement based on unambiguous state discrimination (USD). In cq communication theory, the channel decoder acts directly on the modulated codeword waveform in the quantum (viz., electromagnetic or optical) domain, and it is known that collective measurements on long codeword blocks are needed to attain the Holevo capacity, which is strictly larger than the Shannon capacity of the classical channel induced by any specific measurement choice on each channel use. The USD measurement based channel decoder we propose, can distinguish finite blocklength codeword quantum states unambiguously (i.e., an incorrect codeword is never chosen) provided one allows for a finite probability of obtaining an inconclusive (erasure) outcome. We show that the probability of the inconclusive outcome goes to zero for asymptotically long codewords whenever the code rate is below the Holevo bound. The USD channel decoder is an addition to a small list of other collective measurements known to achieve the Holevo capacity (such as, the square root measurement, the minimum probability of error measurement, the sequential decoding measurement, and the quantum successive cancellation decoder for the cq polar code). A structured optical receiver design is not known yet for any of these decoders. What makes the USD decoder special is that there is no classical analogue to truly unambiguous discrimination (say, of samples drawn from a set of probability distributions). Secondly, the erasures-only decoding of USD is likely to result in a better channel reliability function. Finally, the USD measurement seems more likely to lead naturally to a structured optical receiver design and implementation."
2309490,13990,8228,Impact of smart grid traffic peak loads on shared LTE network performance,2013,"The purpose of the paper is to examine if public long term evolution (LTE) network is suitable for smart grid (SG) automatic metering usage, in a suburban scenario, without causing significant hindrance to typical LTE traffic. In addition, the same generalized suburban scenario is evaluated with a hybrid sensor - LTE network where wireless sensor network (WSN) cluster heads are also equipped with LTE remote terminal units (RTUs). The simulation topology is formed as a suburban area that consists of single RTU per apartment/house for SG traffic and an average 3.7 people per habitat, each with their user equipment, using one of the available carriers. Normal SG traffic is generated in both directions, uplink and downlink. The worst-case usage factor is considered as a power outage, where all SG meters in the area of influence simultaneously detect and attempt to report such a failure. Thus, emergency SG traffic is generated simultaneous by all RTUs. To alleviate the problem of the high momentary SG emergency traffic load, two distinct solutions are proposed and simulated. As the first solution, an artificial, up to one-second random delay is introduced in the transmission scheduling of emergency messages. The second solution applies low-power WSNs at the cluster level and cluster heads that contain both 802.15.4 and LTE communication interfaces, i.e., a hybrid sensor-LTE network. The simulation results show that both of the solutions that try to alleviate the high instantaneous traffic loads can reach the quality of service criteria for SG traffic without compromising other public LTE traffic. The deciding factor to use either pure LTE approach or a hybrid sensor-LTE network comes from non-functional requirements of the system."
1037496,13990,208,DHT-based localized service discovery in wireless mesh networks,2012,"Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) provide high-bandwidth wireless network access to mobile clients in extensible, robust multi-hop networks. WMNs support distributed service provision and data storage, catering to the advanced capabilities of current mobile devices. Services and data discovery using undirected broadcast or multicast messages, as in traditional discovery protocols, significantly harms network performance due to interference and collisions. In contrast, distributed hash tables (DHTs) offer consistent mapping of service and data identifiers to the providing devices and therefore allow a directed unicast discovery and access. However, traditional DHTs place identifiers at arbitrary distant devices in the network, resulting in frequent use of long multi-hop routing paths. Such multi-hop transmissions suffer from performance loss at each hop and also degrade the overall network performance. We propose DLSD, a DHT-based localized index structure that establishes a hierarchy of locally bounded address spaces ranging from a few nearby devices to the whole network. Iterating through this hierarchy bottom-up allows devices to find the most local provider of the requested item, thereby minimizing multi-hop transmissions while ensuring global reachability. Through this reduction of routing hops, we maintain high transmission performance and minimize interference in the network. We evaluate the feasibility of our approach and show that it significantly reduces routing overhead and outperforms traditional service discovery and DHT approaches."
2538292,13990,8228,Low-Weight Channel Coding for Interference Mitigation in Electromagnetic Nanonetworks in the Terahertz Band,2011,"Nanotechnology is providing the engineering community with a new set of tools to design and manufacture integrated devices just a few hundred nanometers in total size. Communication among these nano-devices will boost the range of applications of nanotechnology in several fields, ranging from biomedical research to military technology or environmental science. Within the different alternatives for communication in the nanoscale, recent developments in nanomaterials point to the Terahertz band (0.1-10 THz) as the frequency range of operation of future electromagnetic nano-transceivers. This frequency band can theoretically support very large bit-rates in the short range, i.e., for distances below one meter. Due to the limited capabilities of individual nano-devices, pulse-based communications have been proposed for electromagnetic nanonetworks in the Terahertz band. However, the expectedly very large number of nano-devices and the unfeasibility to coordinate them, can make interference a major impairment for the system. In this paper, low-weight channel coding is proposed as a novel mechanism to reduce interference in pulse-based nanonetworks. Rather than utilizing channel codes to detect and correct transmission errors, it is shown that by appropriately choosing the weight of a code, interference can be mitigated. The performance of the proposed scheme is analytically and numerically investigated both in terms of overall interference reduction and achievable information rate, by utilizing a new statistical interference model. The results show that this type of network-friendly channel coding schemes can be used to alleviate the interference problem in nanonetworks without compromising the individual user information rate."
1292574,13990,369,Energy Efficiency and Capacity Evaluation of LTE-Advanced Downlink CoMP Schemes Subject to Channel Estimation Errors and System Delay,2013,"Due to the increased energy consumption of cellular access networks, energy efficiency of the systems should be considered jointly with spectral efficiency to obtain the overall performance metrics and trade-offs. Downlink coordinated multipoint (CoMP) joint transmission aided cell switch off schemes can mitigate inter-cell interference and increase energy efficiency by using the active cells to serve the users in the switched off cell. However, the performance of this newly proposed scheme is heavily dependent on the accuracy of the selected CoMP joint transmission set. In this paper, we model the multi-point channel estimation enabled via channel state information reference symbols (CSI-RS) introduced in 3GPP release 10 systems and simulate possible scenarios that would lead to inaccurate transmission set clustering: multi-point channel estimation errors and possible CoMP system delays due to CSI transfers, node processing delays and network topology limitations. In order to mitigate the effects of channel estimation errors and system delay, we propose a framework for multi- point channel estimation in CoMP systems using a time-varying interpolation filter which tracks each multipath delay tap separately for every measured point. Possible performance gains with different filter lengths are demonstrated. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. In addition, proof of concept is provided for CoMP adaptive time-varying multi-point estimation filter designs, where the UEs which are being served by higher cluster degrees need to enlarge the estimation filter memory spans only for the points which are more likely to be included in the joint transmission set."
1977098,13990,20338,Can they hear me now?: a case for a client-assisted approach to monitoring wide-area wireless networks,2011,"We present WiScape, a framework for measuring and understanding the behavior of wide-area wireless networks, e.g., city-wide or nation-wide cellular data networks using active participation from clients. The goal of WiScape is to provide a coarse-grained view of a wide-area wireless landscape that allows operators and users to understand broad performance characteristics of the network. In this approach a centralized controller instructs clients to collect measurement samples over time and space in an opportunistic manner. To limit the overheads of this measurement framework, WiScape partitions the world into zones, contiguous areas with relatively similar user experiences, and partitions time into zone-specific epochs over which network statistics are relatively stable. For each epoch in each zone, WiScape takes a minimalistic view --- it attempts to collect a small number of measurement samples to adequately characterize the client experience in that zone and epoch, thereby limiting the bandwidth and energy overheads at client devices. For this effort, we have collected ground truth measurements for up to three different commercial cellular wireless networks across (i) an area of more than 155 square kilometer in and around Madison, WI, in the USA, (ii) a road stretch of more than 240 kilometers between Madison and Chicago, and (iii) locations in New Brunswick and Princeton, New Jersey, USA, for a period of more than 1 year. We justify various design choices of WiScape through this data, demonstrate that WiScape can provide an accurate performance characterization of these networks over a wide area (within 4% error for more than 70% of instances) with a low overhead on the clients, and illustrate multiple applications of this framework through a sustained and ongoing measurement study."
1064772,13990,8839,Distributed spectrum management and relay selection in interference-limited cooperative wireless networks,2011,"It is well known that the data transport capacity of a wireless network can be increased by leveraging the spatial and frequency diversity of the wireless transmission medium. This has motivated the recent surge of research in  cooperative  and   dynamic-spectrum-access  networks. Still, as of today, a key open research challenge is to design distributed control strategies to dynamically jointly assign (i) portions of the spectrum and (ii) cooperative relays to different traffic sessions to maximize the resulting network-wide data rate.   In this article, we make a significant contribution in this direction. First, we mathematically formulate the problem of joint spectrum management and relay selection for a set of sessions concurrently utilizing an interference-limited infrastructure-less wireless network. We then study distributed solutions to this (nonlinear and nonconvex) problem. The overall problem is separated into two subproblems, (i) spectrum management through power allocation with given relay selection strategy, and (ii) relay selection for a given spectral profile. Distributed solutions for each of the two subproblems are proposed, which are then analyzed based on notions from variational inequality (VI) theory. The distributed algorithms can be proven to converge, under certain conditions, to VI solutions, which are also Nash equilibrium (NE) solutions of the equivalent NE problems. A distributed algorithm based on iterative solution of the two subproblems is then designed. Performance and price of anarchy of the distributed algorithm are then studied by comparing it to the globally optimal solution obtained with a centralized algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed algorithm achieves performance that is within a few percentage points of the optimal solution."
2197590,13990,369,On the Delay to Reliably Detect Channel Availability in Cooperative Vehicular Environments,2011,"Vehicular networking has significant potential to enable diverse range of applications, including safety and convenience. As the number of vehicles and applications using wireless spectrum grow, one can expect to see a shortage of either spatially or temporally available spectrum. In this paper, we advocate that dynamic spectrum access for vehicles be the first step towards solving the spectrum shortage. For this, vehicles must be able to sense the availability of spectrum before attempting to transmit. The existence of other transmitters should be detected in order not to cause or experience interference. However, spectrum sensing in vehicular environments is a challenging task due to mobility, shadowing and other factors that govern vehicular environments. Therefore, spectrum sensing by a single vehicle may not be able to provide accurate information about the spectrum vacancies. Cooperative spectrum sensing, on the other hand, uses spatial diversity and can be employed to overcome the limitations associated with a single sensor/vehicle. In this paper, we investigate cooperative spectrum sensing performance in a vehicular environment for sensing signals transmitted from i) a roadside infrastructure and ii) radios located on other vehicles, by using energy-based detection of a transmitted pilot tone as an example. Our goal is to characterize the limits on detection speed and reliability of simple hard and soft cooperative energy-based schemes for this environment. We show how cooperation reduces sensing time by a factor of five in an AWGN channel. The cooperative sensing time reduction is far more significant in a vehicular environment with fading and shadowing. Finally, we illustrate how infrastructure-to-vehicle scenario favors soft equal gain combining while vehicle-to-vehicle scenario favors hard fusion OR rule."
1313732,13990,9913,Evaluation of spectrum access options for indoor mobile network deployment,2013,"The investments in indoor mobile networks are highly related to the spectrum availability and its associated authorization options. The aim of this paper is to discuss the differences in the spectrum demand taking into consideration both wide and local area network deployment requirements and the kind of actor that provides the indoor wireless access. The analysis covers different authorizations options namely licensed, unlicensed, licensed shared access (LSA) and secondary access. A quantitative approach is used to analyze the differences between macrocell and femtocell deployments focusing on deployment cost and spectrum demand. This is complemented by a qualitative study to explore and discuss the strategic business decisions of different actors in view of the available spectrum bands and spectrum authorization options. The main conclusions from this study are; spectrum has more value in macrocell deployment scenarios than in femtocell ones. More spectrum in macrocell deployment scenarios means that operators can deploy less number of new sites and exploit previous infrastructure investments. Femtocell networks are often coverage limited which allows for frequency re-use. As a consequence, the value of spectrum is not the same for mobile network operators (MNOs) and for local network operator (LNOs). MNOs are traditionally confined to macrocell deployment strategies which entail the exclusive usage of licensed bands. While, the use of licensed spectrum by LNOs may incur more cost than the cost of infrastructure deployment. This explains why the use of unlicensed bands is lucrative and viable for LNOs. Furthermore, the LSA scheme may or could soon become an enabler for LNO's business due to the prevailing technical, regulation and policies developments."
1842864,13990,9015,Exploiting ephemeral link correlation for mobile wireless networks,2012,"In wireless mobile networks, energy can be saved by using dynamic transmission scheduling with pre-knowledge about channel conditions. Such pre-knowledge can be obtained via profiling as proposed by several existing systems which assumed that the existence of spatial link correlation makes the measured channel status at one location reusable over a long period of time. Our empirical data, however, tells a different story: spatial link correlation only maintains well within a short duration (from seconds to tens of seconds) while decreases significantly afterwards, a phenomena we call  ephemeral link correlation . By leveraging this observation, we design and implement a real-time transmission scheduling system, named  PreSeer , on the railway platform for cargo transportation, where the transmission of a sink (to cellular towers) can be scheduled intelligently by utilizing  future  channel status measured by sinks located in front of it on the same train. We have implemented and evaluated the PreSeer system on the collected data extensively over 7,000-kilometer railway routes during a period of one and half years. Results reveal that PreSeer can help save as much as 40% energy, comparing with three base-line algorithms. More importantly, lessons learned from this major effort provide useful guidelines for transmission scheduling in highly-dynamic mobile environments, where (i) channel measurements cannot be perfectly aligned due to varying vehicle velocities, and (ii) the accuracy of channel measurements is subject to hardware discrepancy as well as environment irregularity."
2015736,13990,10228,On the performance of downstream traffic distribution scheme in fiber-wireless networks,2011,"Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) access networks, have rapidly matured as a last mile Internet access network solution due to their novel combination of Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPON) as a backhaul and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) as an access network. The high bandwidth provided by the optical lines, as well as the flexibility offered by the wireless network, offers a great degree of cost-efficiency in terms of sharing an optical line with a number of simultaneous users. In a FiWi network, Gateways (GWs) located between the EPON and WMN serve both the function of an Optical Network Unit (ONU) in the EPON and a mesh router in WMN. Since all of the downstream from the EPON to the WMN and all of the upstream from the WMN to the EPON must be exchanged at GWs, traffic distribution technique between GWs is necessary to achieve efficient utilization of the network resources. Controlling the downstream traffic is a significant issue in preventing performance degradation due to network congestion at the GWs, because the bandwidth of WMN is generally narrower than that of the EPON. In addition, the number of hops from a GW to an end-user in the WMN needs to be taken into account in the traffic distribution process, because the increased number of hops results in lower communication efficiency due to mutual interferences between adjacent links and effects of cross traffic. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the downstream controlling of FiWi networks, and propose a traffic distribution scheme which utilizes an aspect of EPON to properly distribute traffic load among GWs. A hop count limitation mechanism is adopted to avoid throughput degradation caused by increased wireless interference and effects of cross traffic in the WMN. Simulation results show a trade-off relationship between fair load balancing among GWs and high throughput for end-users, and the proposed scheme can accommodate it by regulating hop count limitation."
922204,13990,369,On the Effect of Gaussian Imperfect Channel Estimations on the Performance of Space Modulation Techniques,2012,"Space modulation techniques, such as spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK), are efficient lowcomplexity implementation of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. In such techniques, a single transmit-antenna is activated during each time instant and the activated antenna index is used to convey information. Due to the novel method of conveying information, a major criticism arises on the practicality of such techniques in the presence of real-time imperfections such as channel estimation errors. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to shed light on this issue. The performance of such systems are analyzed in the presence of Gaussian imperfect channel estimations. More specifically, the performance of SSK system consisting of Nt transmit and Nr receive antennas with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver is studied. The exact average bit error probability (ABEP) over Rayleigh fading channels is obtained in closed-form for Nt = 2 and arbitrary Nr; while union upper bound is used to compute the ABEP when Nt > 2 and arbitrary Nr. Furthermore, simple and general asymptotic expression for the ABEP is derived and analyzed. Besides, the effect of imperfect CSI on the performance of SM, Alamouti and SSK schemes considering different number of channel estimation pilots are studied and compared via numerical Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that, on the contrary to the raised criticism, space modulation techniques are more robust to channel estimation errors than Alamouti since the probability of error is determined by the differences between channels associated with the different transmit antennas rather than the actual channel realization."
2476516,13990,23836,Distributed Algorithms for Joint Routing and Frame Aggregation in 802.11n Wireless Mesh Networks,2013,"A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a special type of wireless ad-hoc network, which consists of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways to the Internet, organized in a mesh topology. The mesh clients are often laptops, cell phones and other wireless devices. Mesh routers forward traffic between mesh clients and gateways. Despite a number of promising features provided by WMNs, such as low deployment cost, self-healing, etc., the throughput of WMNs is often limited by severe congestion and collisions, and thus cannot satisfy the increasing traffic demands of numerous applications. In this paper, we study how to maximize the throughput of IEEE 802.11n WMNs by joint routing and frame aggregation. Frame aggregation is to aggregate multiple frames into a large frame before transmission, to reduce communication overhead and alleviate collisions. We first show that previous frame aggregation strategies cannot achieve optimal network throughput. We then formulate the joint problem into a linear programming (LP) problem by considering traffic in the network as flow. As most previous algorithms for LP are centralized and difficult to deploy in large-scale WMNs, we propose a distributed algorithm to solve the formulated problem, in which each mesh router determines the amount of traffic flow for its adjacent links based on the traffic information of neighbors and interfering links. However, in realistic 802.11n WMNs, traffic is transmitted in frames instead of flow, and the traffic to different routers needs to be distinguished. Thus, we further provide an algorithm to determine the routing and frame aggregation strategy for each mesh router, using the traffic flow derived from the first algorithm. We have conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithms and the results demonstrate that the network throughput can be significantly improved compared with existing schemes."
2286443,13990,20348,Exploration of path space using sensor network geometry,2011,"In a sensor network there are many paths between a source and a destination. An efficient method to explore and navigate in the ‘path space’ can help many important routing primitives, in particular, multipath routing and resilient routing (when nodes or links can fail unexpectedly) as considered in this paper. Both problems are challenging for a general graph setting, especially if each node cannot afford to have the global knowledge. In this paper we use a geometric approach to allow efficient exploration of the path space with very little overhead. We are motivated by the recent development on regulating a sensor network geometry using confor-mal mapping [44,45], in which any sensor network can be embedded to be circular (and any possible hole is made circular as well) and greedy routing guarantees delivery. In this paper we explore the freedom of a Mobius transformation inherent to this conformal mapping. By applying a Mobius transformation we can get an alternative embedding with the same property such that greedy routing generates a different path. We present distributed algorithms using local information and limited global information (the positions and sizes of the holes) to generate disjoint multi-paths for a given source destination pair or switch to a different path ‘on the fly’ when transmission failure is encountered. The overhead of applying a Mobius transformation simply boils down to four parameters that could be carried by a packet or determined at need at the source. Demonstrated by simulation results, this method compares favorably in terms of performance and cost metrics with centralized solutions of using flow algorithms or random walk based decentralized solutions in generating alternative paths."
1622265,13990,22021,Polar coding to achieve the Holevo capacity of a pure-loss optical channel,2012,"In the low-energy high-energy-efficiency regime of classical optical communications — relevant to deep-space optical channels — there is a big gap between reliable communication rates achievable via conventional optical receivers and the ultimate (Holevo) capacity. Achieving the Holevo capacity requires not only optimal codes but also receivers that make collective measurements on long (modulated) codeword waveforms, and it is impossible to implement these collective measurements via symbol-by-symbol detection along with classical postprocessing [1], [2]. Here, we apply our recent results on the classical-quantum polar code [3] — the first near-explicit, linear, symmetric-Holevo-rate achieving code — to the lossy optical channel, and we show that it almost closes the entire gap to the Holevo capacity in the low photon number regime. In contrast, Arikan's original polar codes, applied to the DMC induced by the physical optical channel paired with any conceivable structured optical receiver (including optical homodyne, heterodyne, or direct-detection) fails to achieve the ultimate Holevo limit to channel capacity. However, our polar code construction (which uses the quantum fidelity as a channel parameter rather than the classical Bhattacharyya quantity to choose the “good channels” in the polar-code construction), paired with a quantum successive-cancellation receiver — which involves a sequence of collective non-destructive binary projective measurements on the joint quantum state of the received codeword waveform — can attain the Holevo limit, and can hence in principle achieve higher rates than Arikan's polar code and decoder directly applied to the optical channel. However, even a theoretical recipe for construction of an optical realization of the quantum successive-cancellation receiver remains an open question."
1679436,13990,369,Blind Maximum Likelihood Interference Mitigation for PDCCH of 3GPP LTE/LTE-A,2014,"The performance of the downlink physical channels of 3GPP LTE/LTE-A system is typically limited by co-channel interference from neighboring cells. Therefore, the development of efficient algorithms for interference mitigation at the mobile receiver has recently attracted a lot of attention in academia and industry. There have been a number of studies on advanced interference cancellation and suppression techniques for the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) of LTE/LTE A carrying data packets to the users. One of the most promising schemes identified for demodulation of PDSCH is the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver. It was shown by link-level analysis that the joint ML detection of serving and interfering signals can provide performance improvement. Due to its performance benefits, the ML receiver should be also considered for demodulation of other downlink channels including the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) which carries downlink and uplink scheduling assignments. However, a number of issues specific only to PDCCH could make problematic the use of the conventional ML receiver designed for PDSCH. More specifically, transparent power control on PDCCH (i.e., without network signaling to the user) at both serving and interfering cells as well as random interference hit from PDCCH transmissions of interfering cells may result to non-negligible performance degradation of PDCCH when the conventional ML receiver is used. Therefore, in this paper we propose an enhanced ML receiver for the PDCCH with the ability of blind power boosting estimation and interference hit detection. Using link-level simulations it is shown that in interference limited scenarios the proposed ML receiver provides remarkable error rate improvements for PDCCH over the conventional ML and linear receivers such as Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) and Enhanced Minimum Mean-Squared Error with Interference Rejection Combining (E-MMSE-IRC)."
1872999,13990,10228,Energy-efficient platform designed for SDMA applications in mobile wireless sensor networks,2011,"Although advance network planning and dense node deployment, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) may achieve the required performance, it still face the fundamental challenge of meeting stringent power and time requirements using nodes with limited sensing capacities. To better cope with the power consumption problem, mobile sensor nodes can be introduced to dynamically reconfigure the sensor network capacity in an on-demand manner. Through data gathering and relaying, mobile nodes can reduce the amount of data transmitting between the static nodes then conserve the power of these nodes to prolong the lifetime of network. In this paper we describe the DataTruck, a new open-source sensing platform specifically designed to support our experimental research in mobile sensor networks, which is used to collect or relay data from static sensors. The DataTruck node is designed around the S3C2440A ARM920T RISC microprocessor and the IEEE 802.15.4 compliant CC2431 radio from Chipcon. Mobility is enabled with an additional accessory board that allows the node to drive its 4 linear motion actuators. To reduce power consumption, a long term sleep mode is supported through different power supplying methods for main board and clock. Furthermore, we integrated a smart antenna system to gather the data from multiple static nodes concurrently which transmitting data using the same frequency of channel. The experiments show that DataTruck collects data efficiently to reduce the average data transmission delay by using SDMA technology."
1337773,13990,23653,Distributed greedy approximation to maximum weighted independent set for scheduling with fading channels,2013,"Developing scheduling mechanisms that can simultaneously achieve throughput optimality and good delay performance often require solving the Maximum Independent Weighted Set (MWIS) problem. However, under most realistic network settings, the MWIS problem can be shown to be NP-hard. In non-fading environments, low-complexity scheduling algorithms have been provided that converge either to the MWIS solution in time or to a solution that achieves at least a provable fraction of the achievable throughput. However, in more practical systems the channel conditions can vary at faster time-scales than convergence occurs in these lower-complexity algorithms. Hence, these algorithms cannot take advantage of the opportunistic gain, and may no longer guarantee good performance. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity scheduling scheme that performs provably well under fading channels and is amenable to implement in a distributed manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheduling scheme under fading environments that requires only local information, has a low complexity that grows logarithmically with the network size, and achieves provable performance guarantees (which is arbitrarily close to that of the well-known centralized Greedy Maximal Scheduler). Through simulations we verify that both the throughput and the delay under our proposed distributed scheduling scheme are close to that of the optimal solution to MWIS. Further, we implement a preliminary version of our algorithm in a testbed by modifying the existing IEEE 802.11 DCF. The preliminary experiment results show that our implementation successfully accounts for wireless fading, and attains the opportunistic gains in practice, and hence substantially outperforms IEEE 802.11 DCF."
814759,13990,8228,Receive antenna shift keying for time reversal wireless communications,2012,"Wireless communication systems based on Time Reversal (TR) and a Single Tap Receiver (STR) are optimum at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), while keeping low complexity at the receiver. Thus, they are interesting for low order Phase and Amplitude Modulations, such as Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) or Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK). However, at higher Signal to Noise Ratio, Inter-Symbol Interference prevents from using higher order modulations such as 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16QAM) or 64QAM. This paper presents a new spatial modulation technique called Received Antenna Shift Keying (RASK), enabling the use of higher order modulation with TR and STR. Information is not conveyed by Phase and Amplitude Modulation (PAM). Instead, at the transmitter side, Time Reversal pre-filtering technique is used to focus a signal with constant amplitude and phase onto a single receive antenna among several receive antennas. Every symbol duration, the transmitter updates the target receive antenna. The index of the antenna is simply equal to the integer value coded by the binary sequence of information that has to be transmitted during the considered symbol. At the receiver side, each antenna has a Single Tap Receiver. The output of the Single Tap Receivers are used by a simple detector to determine the target receive antenna among all antennas. The detected antenna index is then converted into a binary sequence. If N is the number of receive antennas, a N-RASK system transmits Log 2 (N) bits per symbol. The performance of 16RASK is compared to 16QAM, with Time Reversal, and 1 bit Time Reversal, using simulations modeling inter-symbol and un-perfect spatial focusing. The study shows that 16RASK outperforms 16QAM, under strong multipath or when the number of transmit antennas is high."
1176757,13990,369,Degrees of Freedom of Downlink Single- and Multi-Cell Multi-User MIMO Systems with Location Based CSIT,2013,"Multiple antennas facilitate the coexistence of multiple users in wireless communications, leading to spatial multiplexing and spatial division and to significant system capacity increase. However, this comes at the cost of very precise channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). We advocate the use of channel propagation models to transform location information into (possibly incomplete) CSIT. We investigate the resulting multi-user sum rate from a DoF (Degree of Freedom, high SNR rate prelog, spatial multiplexing factor) point of view. For single-cell multi-user communications, we argue for a revival of SDMA (Spatial Division Multiple Access). In the MIMO case, the receive antennas can suppress the Non Line of Sight (NLoS) channel components to transform the MIMO channel into a MISO LoS channel, allowing the CSIT to be limited to LoS information. For the multi-cell problem, we consider the feasibility of interference aligment in the case of reduced rank MIMO channels. We then focus on the LoS components. Whereas in general MIMO multi-cell coordinated beamforming, the transmitters require global CSIT due to the coupling between transmit and receive filters, in the LoS case decoupling arises, permitting location based transmit beamforming. Location aided techniques may furthermore exploit location prediction through mobility trajectory information. This would allow slow fading (and even connectivity) predictibility, something that is difficult to achieve without location information."
1655648,13990,8228,Joint Viterbi decoding and decision feedback equalization for monobit digital receivers,2013,"In ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems with impulse radio (IR) modulation, the bandwidth is usually 1GHz or more. To process the received signal digitally, high sampling rate analog-digital-converters (ADC) are required. Due to the high complexity and large power consumption, employing multibit high-rate ADC is impractical. However, monobit ADC is appropriate. The optimal monobit digital receiver has already been proposed. This kind of receiver has been derived under the assumption that the intersymbol interference (ISI) either does not exist or can be regarded as random noises. When encountered with heavy ISI, these receivers are not excellent as we expected. There are many approaches to solve the ISI problem in regular communication systems. When applied to monobit systems, unfortunately, most of them turned out to be unavailable due to the great loss of quantification. Decision feedback equalization (DFE) is an effect way to deal with ISI in monobit digital systems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that combines Viterbi decoding and DFE together for monobit receivers. In this way, we suppress the impact of ISI effectively, thus improving the bit error rate (BER) performance. In addition, we introduce a method called state expansion by which better BER performance can be achieved. Under the condition of perfect channel state information(PCSI), the simulation results show that the algorithm has about 1dB SNR gain compared to separate monobit BPSK demodulation with convolutional decoding and 1dB SNR loss compared to the BER performance of optimal monobit receiver in the channel without ISI. Compared to the full resolution detection in fading channel without ISI, it has 3dB SNR loss after state expansion. Under the CSI that achieved from iterative evaluation, both the performance of optimal monobit receiver and joint receiver have 1dB loss compared to that of PCSI."
1072347,13990,369,28 GHz Angle of Arrival and Angle of Departure Analysis for Outdoor Cellular Communications Using Steerable Beam Antennas in New York City,2013,"Propagation measurements at 28 GHz were conducted in outdoor urban environments in New York City using four different transmitter locations and 83 receiver locations with distances of up to 500 m. A 400 mega- chip per second channel sounder with steerable 24.5 dBi horn antennas at the transmitter and receiver was used to measure the angular distributions of received multipath power over a wide range of propagation distances and urban settings. Measurements were also made to study the small-scale fading of closely-spaced power delay profiles recorded at half-wavelength (5.35 mm) increments along a small-scale linear track (10 wavelengths, or 107 mm) at two different receiver locations. Our measurements indicate that power levels for small- scale fading do not significantly fluctuate from the mean power level at a fixed angle of arrival. We propose here a new lobe modeling technique that can be used to create a statistical channel model for lobe path loss and shadow fading, and we provide many model statistics as a function of transmitter- receiver separation distance. Our work shows that New York City is a multipath-rich environment when using highly directional steerable horn antennas, and that an average of 2.5 signal lobes exists at any receiver location, where each lobe has an average total angle spread of 40.3° and an RMS angle spread of 7.8°. This work aims to create a 28 GHz statistical spatial channel model for future 5G cellular networks."
1737917,13990,23836,It's About Time: On Optimal Virtual Network Embeddings under Temporal Flexibilities,2014,"Distributed applications often require high-performance networks with strict connectivity guarantees. For instance, many cloud applications suffer from today's variations of the intra-cloud bandwidth, which leads to poor and unpredictable application performance. Accordingly, we witness a trend towards virtual networks (VNets) which can provide resource isolation. Interestingly, while the problem of where to embed a VNet is fairly well-understood today, much less is known about when to optimally allocate a VNet. This however is important, as the requirements specified for a VNet do not have to be static, but can vary over time and even include certain temporal flexibilities. This paper initiates the study of the temporal VNet embedding problem (TVNEP). We propose a continuous-time mathematical programming approach to solve the TVNEP, and present and compare different algorithms. Based on these insights, we present the CSM-Model which incorporates both symmetry and state-space reductions to significantly speed up the process of computing exact solutions to the TVNEP. Based on the CSM-Model, we derive a greedy algorithm OGA to compute fast approximate solutions. In an extensive computational evaluation, we show that despite the hardness of the TVNEP, the CSM-Model is sufficiently powerful to solve moderately sized instances to optimality within one hour and under different objective functions (such as maximizing the number of embeddable VNets). We also show that the greedy algorithm exploits flexibilities well and yields good solutions. More generally, our results suggest that already little time flexibilities can improve the overall system performance significantly."
1741873,13990,10192,Community Membership Management for Transient Social Networks,2012,"Confluence of technologies represented by geo- location, geo-sensing, context and activity recognition, and smart phones with rich sensors is opening up new avenues for media-rich social interactions for a spectrum of applications from entertainment, to commerce, to emergency response. This paper addresses the challenges in membership management of a transient social network (TSN), a community of users with mobile devices engaging in social activities of common interest within specific temporal and geographical locality (e.g., flea market, emergency response, local auctions, etc.). Creating and maintaining viable transient social communities requires solving a number of significant challenges including managing the dynamically created social graph, maintaining connectivity across heterogeneous nodes and interfaces and efficient message delivery among the nodes in a community. Micrograph is a middleware for managing community membership in TSNs. It helps nodes to discover and participate with other nodes based on device-level, or application-level attributes. It allows a node to simultaneously participate in multiple distinct social communities by overlaying multiple TSNs on top of the available nodes in the physical network. Micrograph gives complete isolation for the activities of a node in each of the TSNs that a node may be participating in simultaneously and it also gives complete transparency to a participant as to the membership of a TSN in which he/she is involved in. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Micrograph, a proof-of-concept implementation of the middleware using Android platforms, four applications to show the feasibility of Micrograph, and simulation-based evaluation of the implemented prototype."
1077696,13990,10228,DEBUT: Delay bounded service discovery in urban Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks,2013,"This paper studies delay-bounded service discovery in urban Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), which refers to locating resources and services (e.g., local sensor data and multimedia content) distributed on individual vehicles in the network within a certain delay bound. To facilitate the discovery process, a set of vehicles, called service directories (SDs), can be selected to store the index information of all the resources in the network. Selecting an optimal SD set with minimal size while satisfying the users' requirement of a bounded query response delay is very difficult due to the disruptive nature of VANETs. In this paper, we formulate the Delay Bounded Service Directory Selection (DB-Sel) problem as an optimization problem that minimizes the number of SDs under the delay bound constraint. We prove theoretically that the DB-Sel problem is NP-Complete even when the future positions of vehicles are known a priori. We observe and prove that the number of vehicles encountered by arbitrarily selected SDs within a given delay follows a normal distribution. We also find the contact probabilities among the vehicles exhibit strong temporal correlation. With these observations, we develop a heuristic algorithm which iteratively selects the best candidate according to the normal distribution property and the historical contact probability. We prove that our algorithms have a guaranteed performance approximation ratio compared to the optimal solution. Extensive trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm can guarantee the required query delay and select SD sets 20% smaller than those selected by alternative algorithms."
1032385,13990,8839,Mobile network performance evaluation using the radio frequency network channel emulation simulation tool(RFnest,2013,"In this demonstration, we present new capabilities of Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) Radio Frequency Network Emulation Simulation Tool (RFnestTM) (www.i-a-i.com/rfnest). RFnestTM is a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based network channel emulator that allows all of the channels of a full network of radio nodes to be emulated in real time, with all communication nodes experiencing a realistic channel impulse response. This allows RFnestTM to be used for protocol testing, replaying field tests, and model validation. RFnestTM has a modular design with three main capabilities: 1) FPGA based emulation hardware with RF front ends that allows nodes with real radios to send their RF signal over an emulated channel without any modification to the radio, 2) modeling of time-varying channel impulse responses within the emulation hardware, with channel properties based on mobility defined with a scripted or interactive Graphic User Interface (GUI) environment, and 3) integration with network emulators and monitoring functionality that allows the user to instantiate, manage, and monitor real and virtual network nodes within the scenario. In the new version of RFnestTM we now support: Frequency programmability: The new RFnestTM allows users to change the center frequency through software from 800 Mhz to 2.7GHz. Increased bandwidth: RFnestTM supports a bandwidth of 60 MHz. Higher fidelity channel modeling: Through software and hardware updates RFnestTM support wireless channels with up to 20 taps and a wide range of Doppler frequencies. MIMO: RFnestTM now supports different combination of MIMO channel between transmitters and receivers.   We will demonstrate the capabilities of RFnestTM with scenarios, including multi-hop bulk data transfer in mixed real virtual network, bulk data transmission at 900MHz and video transfer between two real nodes."
1326454,13990,8228,Classifier selection for physical layer security augmentation in Cognitive Radio networks,2013,"Cognitive Radio (CR) networks create an environment that presents unique security challenges, with reliable user authentication being essential for mitigating Primary User Emulation (PUE) spoofing and ensuring the cognition engine is using reliable information when dynamically reconfiguring the network. Unfortunately, wireless network edge devices increase spoofing potential as all devices can “see” all network traffic within RF range. Conventional bit-level security helps, but additional security based on physical-layer (PHY) attributes is required to ensure unauthorized devices do not adversely impact CR reliability during environmental assessment. RF Distinct Native Attribute (RF-DNA) fingerprinting is one PHY technique for reliably identifying devices based on inherent emission differences. These differences are exploited to uniquely identify, by serial number, hardware devices and aid cognitive network security. Reliable device discrimination has been achieved using Multiple Discriminant Analysis, Maximum Likelihood (MDA/ML) processing. However, MDA/ML provides no insight into feature relevance which limits its use for optimizing feature selection. This limitation is addressed here using Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization-Improved (GRLVQI) and Learning from Signals (LFS) classifiers. Comparative assessment shows that GRLVQI and LFS classification performance rivals that of MDA/ML, overcomes inherent MDA/ML limitations, and provides benefit for CR network applications where reliable RF environment assessment and PUE mitigation is essential."
2472283,13990,9589,Collaborative Consumption for Mobile Broadband: A Quantitative Study,2014,"Mobile broadband is predominantly priced following tiered plans that involve a certain prepaid emph{commit volume} and additional metered volume priced at a higher emph{penalty rate}. An individual's demand, however, may vary wildly from month to month and thus users inevitably purchase packages that are either too small or too large for their needs. By collaborating in predefined closed (eg, family) or open groups (eg, through tethering) users can reduce both the amount of paid-but-left-unused capacity or the high penalty rates. In this paper we present a quantitative study of collaborative consumption using data from 40K mobile subscribers and tariffs from ten operators around the world. We show that small 2-person family plans offer modest expected savings in the range of 3% to 14%, whereas getting more substantial savings requires rather impractically large groups of approximately 10 people or more. Going over to open groups, where users can freely trade their data capacity, we characterize the impact of the secondary market price on the user costs and the operator revenues, and show that Telcos might be better off to embrace secondary markets (eg, let them integrate with billing), and thus have some control on, as opposed to letting them operate unsupervised through tethering. The latter may severely harm the revenues of a Telco, in an uncontrolled manner, especially in densely populated areas."
1152214,13990,8839,MC 2 : Multimode User-Centric Design of Wireless Sensor Networks for Long-Term Monitoring,2014,"Real-world, long-running wireless sensor networks (WSNs) require intense user intervention in the development, hardware testing, deployment, and maintenance stages. A majority of network design is network centric and focuses primarily on network performance, for example, efficient sensing and reliable data delivery. Although several tools have been developed to assist debugging and fault diagnosis, it is yet to systematically examine the underlying heavy burden that users face throughout the lifetime of WSNs. In this article, we propose a general Multimode user-CentriC (MC 2 ) framework that can, with simple user inputs, adjust itself to assist user operation and thus reduce the users' burden at various stages. In particular, we have identified utilities that are essential at each stage and grouped them into  modes . In each mode, only the corresponding utilities will be loaded, and modes can be easily switched using the customized MC 2  sensor platform. As such, we reduce the runtime interference between various utilities and simplify their development as well as their debugging. We validated our MC 2  software and the sensor platform in a long-lived microclimate monitoring system deployed at a wildland heritage site, Mogao Grottoes. In our current system, 241 sensor nodes have been deployed in 57 caves, and the network has been running for over five years. Our experimental validation shows that the MC 2  framework shortens the time for network deployment and maintenance, and makes network maintenance doable by field experts (in our case, historians)."
2482602,13990,10228,Spectral- and energy-efficient antenna tilting in a HetNet using reinforcement learning,2013,"In cellular networks, balancing the throughput among users is important to achieve a uniform Quality-of-Service (QoS). This can be accomplished using a variety of cross-layer techniques. In this paper, the authors investigate how the down-tilt of base-station (BS) antennas can be adjusted to maximize the user throughput fairness in a heterogeneous network, considering the impact of both a dynamic user distribution and capacity saturation of different transmission techniques. Finding the optimal down-tilt in a multi-cell interference-limited network is a complex problem, where stochastic channel effects and irregular antenna patterns has yielded no explicit solutions and is computationally expensive. The investigation first demonstrates that a fixed tilt strategy yields good performances for homogeneous networks, but the introduction of HetNet elements adds a high level of sensitivity to the tilt dependent performance. This means that a HetNet must have network-wide knowledge of where BSs, access-points and users are. The paper also demonstrates that transmission techniques that can achieve a higher level of capacity saturation increases the optimal down-tilt angle. A distributed reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, where BSs do not need knowledge of location data. The algorithm can achieve convergence to a near-optimal solution rapidly (6-15 iterations) and improve the throughput fairness by 45-56% and the energy efficiency by 21-47%, as compared to fixed strategies. Furthermore, the paper shows that a tradeoff between the optimal solution convergence rate and asymptotic performance exists for the self-learning algorithm."
1247191,13990,8228,Energy efficient M2M communications for aerospace monitoring applications,2013,"Traditional aerospace testing and monitoring systems are based on point-to-point analog wiring, which results in bulky and heavy cables, difficult installation and maintenance and a limited number of sensors. Switching to wireless would alleviate these constraints but creates new challenges due to the high data rates, transfer reliability requirements and energy constraints. Indeed, with sensor counts ranging from a hundred to a thousand of sensors, data rates can reach several hundred megabits per second and there can be as many as several hundred network nodes communicating on the different wireless channels. Although in this application the network is static, the challenge comes from real-time and reliable communication requirements. There is also a strong need for energy efficient machine to machine communications as each node is powered from a battery or from energy harvesting. This paper describes a machine to machine wireless communications architecture tailored for this purpose, based on a low power Impulse Radio Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB) physical layer and an energy efficient MAC layer. This paper describes the design and implementation of the physical and MAC layers which allows a high reconfigurability in terms of data rate, number of nodes, communication range and spectrum occupation. Both design-time and run-time reconfigurability at the MAC layer allows to further reduce the power requirements by tailoring the network interface properties to the specific needs of the application, such as the bit rate, the transmission power, the wireless channel and the number of network nodes."
959239,13990,369,Close-Coupled Chips Can Coordinate to Contain Collisions,2014,"Reducing collisions caused by the concurrent trans- missions of RFID chips (tags) is a crucial research topic in designing efficient air-interface protocols in passive-tag RFID systems. Different anti-collision protocols are proposed to improve the tag reading efficiency, by ordering the tags' participation over a period of time, by stochastic or deterministic manner. All existing anti-collision protocols follow a 'single line of thought'; wherein the onus for mitigating collisions is always on the reader, with no active role being played by the tags. We propose a fundamentally different strategy of enabling communications among the tags, especially to assist the reader in further resolving collisions. Overthrowing the conventional wisdom of limited RFID communication allowed only between the reader and tags, recent experimental studies have shown the possibility of Tag-to-Tag (T2T) communication, in industry popular UHF RFID systems. Two tags within the Near-Field (NF) of each other, can electro- magnetically couple with and therefore communicate, as long as they are receiving energy from the reader. A critical property of NF communication systems is their small reading range, about 30mm for a 900MHZ UHF RFID system. This provides a two spheres of communication, and enables concurrent T2T communications to happen within the long-range (around 6m) of a UHF RFID system. In this NF UHF passive tag RFID system, a tag can promiscuously listen to its NF neighboring tags' collided- transmissions, and give them a second chance for identification. In this paper, we will augment two different variants of frame- slotted ALOHA protocols to support promiscuous learning of NF tags, and study the change in reading efficiency in terms of delay and energy costs. Our detailed performance evaluation study will demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed augmented protocols, both in terms of delay and energy costs."
2134071,13990,208,LOOP: A location based routing scheme for opportunistic networks,2012,"As a key enabling technology for pervasive computing, opportunistic networks have attracted intensive research efforts recently. In this paper, we present a new routing scheme for opportunistic networks that aims at forwarding messages to a destination location/area, instead of forwarding to specific nodes. Our routing scheme, termed LOOP for LOcation based routing for OPportunistic networks, exploits the regularity embedded in human moving pattern. As human movements often exhibit a high degree of repetition including regular visits to certain places and regular contacts during daily activities, we can predict a mobile node's future locations based on its mobility trace with high confidence. We formulate the movement pattern mining as a multi-label classification problem and construct a Bayes' predictive model to explore the mobility history and learn the movement pattern. This movement pattern will then be used to predict the node's future movement. Based on the prediction, the ability of the node to deliver a message to the destination is quantified through defined metrics. These metrics will be the determining factor for choosing proper relaying nodes in several proposed strategies. Our scheme can preserve privacy as no information, including location information, needs to be exchanged among nodes. At the same time, our scheme achieves total distributed control as each node can choose its individual forwarding strategy without involving network wide changes. Our analytical and simulation results show that LOOP can achieve significant performance gains over well known existing strategies for routing in opportunistic networks."

Smart grid benefits from a variety of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for the betterment of the power grid. Two-way communications between the customers and the utility, advanced monitoring tools and intelligent control mechanisms are the key components to realize the new services of the smart grid. Particularly, energy monitoring tools at the customer premises as well as event and ambient monitoring tools at the substations, power lines and vaults play a significant role in managing and protecting the smart grid. Wireless sensor network (WSN) technology is a promising monitoring tool for residential premises and the smart grid assets. However, the large volume of data collected by billions of sensors requires a robust communication infrastructure to deliver data from the field to the operators in a timely manner. In this paper, we adopt the Fiber-WSN architecture to support both WSN data and Fiber To The Home/Building/Curb (FTTX) traffic. We design a Fi-WSN gateway that allows data prioritization, maintains the Quality of Service (QoS) of FTTX users and delivers WSN data in a reliable manner. Data prioritization is fundamental for design considerations since ambient data have lower priority than an alarm generated at a smart grid asset. Our gateway employs a burst assembly mechanism that allows differentiation between high and low priority packets in the Fiber-WSN architecture. We show that the proposed gateway design attains low delay for high priority packets while maintaining the delay of FTTX traffic and the reliability of the WSN at desired levels."

In this paper, we give a detailed description of the channel measurements including route, RX and TX antenna sites and other channel parameters. The results of received signal level (RSL) obtained by using two different signal processing methods are demonstrated, and it is found that the influence of unwanted interference and noise becomes more than 2 dB at distances beyond 20 km, which proves the necessity of employing an interference-reduction method. The inbound trip RSL is found to be larger (~6 dB) than for the outbound trip, which is assumed to be due to the inbound TX antenna resting on the furthermost edge of a large horizontal metal plane, which might act as a mirror to create its image. The path loss has been compared with the free-space model, the Okumura-Hata model, the COST 231-Hata model and the ITU-R P.1546-2 model, and it has been found that the ITU-R model for open cold sea corresponding to field-strength value exceeded at 50% of the locations fits the measurement results best. However, some important deep fadings visible in our measurements are not seen in these models. Finally, the channel spatial correlation coefficient between the two RX-antennas is found to be less than 0.7 beyond a distance of 3 km. The ship turning and shadowing effect caused by other ships might, however, reduce the spatial correlation between the two RX channels."

Network providers need to be able to guarantee the strict Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of real-time variable bit rate (VBR) video users, and a good statistical model for multiplexed video traffic can help significantly to evaluate and enhance network performance under various video loads. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new hybrid video traffic model for MPEG-4 video. The genres of the videos considered in our study include lectures, cartoons, talk shows, action movies, sci-fi and sports. In the first part of our work, we build a Discrete Autoregressive model of order one (DAR(1)) and discuss its efficiency on capturing the behavior of real MPEG-4 video traces. We then proceed to build and evaluate a hybrid model which combines the DAR(1) model with a scene-change detection and classification algorithm, in order to provide us with higher modeling accuracy. The classification is performed based on the average number of bits generated during the scenes and the scene activity is modeled by a Markov chain where each state represents the degree of activity (high/low).

The system includes multiple base-stations cooperatively transmitting data to a pool of users, which share a rate-limited feedback channel for sending back the channel state information (CSI). The feedback mechanism is divided into two stages that are used separately for scheduling and beamforming. In the first stage, the users report their best channel gain from all the base-station antennas and the basestations schedule the best user for each of their antennas. The scheduled users are then polled in the second stage to feedback their quantized channel vectors. The paper proposes an analytical framework to derive the bit allocation between the two feedback stages and the bit allocation for quantizing each user's CSI. For a total number of feedback bits B, it is shown that the number of bits assigned to the second feedback stage should scale as log B. Furthermore, in quantizing channel vectors from different base-stations, each user should allocate its feedback budget in proportion to the logarithm of the corresponding channel gains. These bit allocation are then used to show that the overall system performance scales double-logarithmically with B and logarithmically with the transmit SNR. The paper further presents several numerical results to show that, in comparison with other beamforming-scheduling algorithms in the literature, the proposed scheme provides a consistent improvement in downlink sum rate and network utility. Such improvements, in particular, are achieved in spite of a significant reduction in the beamforming-scheduling computational complexity, which makes the proposed scheme an attractive solution for practical system implementations."
885457,13990,9015,Real-time classification via sparse representation in acoustic sensor networks,2013,"Acoustic Sensor Networks (ASNs) have a wide range of applications in natural and urban environment monitoring, as well as indoor activity monitoring. In-network classification is critically important in ASNs because wireless transmission costs several orders of magnitude more energy than computation. The main challenges of in-network classification in ASNs include effective feature selection, intensive computation requirement and high noise levels. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse representation based feature-less, low computational cost, and noise resilient framework for in-network classification in ASNs. The key component of Sparse Approximation based Classification (SAC), e 1  minimization, is a convex optimization problem, and is known to be computationally expensive. Furthermore, SAC algorithms assumes that the test samples are a linear combination of a few training samples in the training sets. For acoustic applications, this results in a very large training dictionary, making the computation infeasible to be performed on resource constrained ASN platforms. Therefore, we propose several techniques to reduce the size of the problem, so as to fit SAC for in-network classification in ASNs. Our extensive evaluation using two real-life datasets (consisting of calls from 14 frog species and 20 cricket species respectively) shows that the proposed SAC framework outperforms conventional approaches such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and  k -Nearest Neighbor ( k NN) in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Moreover, our SAC approach can deal with multi-label classification which is common in ASNs. Finally, we explore the system design spaces and demonstrate the real-time feasibility of the proposed framework by the implementation and evaluation of an acoustic classification application on an embedded ASN testbed."
1528745,13990,369,Multichannel Cognitive Medium Access Control Protocol for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks,2012,"Intelligent transportation system (ITS) has enjoyed a tremendous growth in the last decade and the advancement in communication technologies has played a major role behind the success of ITS. Due to the nature of communication in vehicular environments, wireless access is considered as an integral part of any ITS system. The IEEE 1609.4 has evolved as a standard for wireless access for vehicular environment (WAVE), which describes multichannel access operations over the 5.9GHz dedicated short range communications (DSRC) spectrum. Communication Channels in the 1609.4 are grouped into service and control channels. Control channels (CCHs) are used for transmission of safety and management messages (e.g., traffic congestion data, data for emergency services) whereas service channels (SCHs) are used for the nodes to transmit service data (e.g., voice,video). In existing channel access mechanism, a node stays in the control channel to receive safety and management messages and then switches to service channel for data transmission. The key problem with this channel access mechanism is that half of the service channel intervals remain idle and unused as all nodes have to listen to control channel during that interval, which makes the WAVE system underutilized and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a medium access control (MAC) protocol for WAVE system to improve the channel utilization and reliability of safety messages. The proposed protocol has been developed based on the concept of cognitive radio and it outperforms the existing channel access mechanism by a significant margin in terms of channel utilization. Simulation results confirm that the proposed cognitive MAC protocol increases the channel utilization up to 70% compared to the IEEE 1609.4 standard, and maintains reliability for the safety related data transmission."
2079715,13990,374,A Probabilistic Framework for Localization of Attackers in MANETs,2012,"Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) represent an attrac- tive and cost effective solution for providing connectivity in areas where a fixed infrastructure is not available or not a viable option. However, given their wireless nature and the lack of a stable infrastructure, MANETs are susceptible to a wide range of attacks waged by malicious nodes physi- cally located within the transmission range of legitimate nodes. Whilst most research has focused on methods for detecting attacks, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for estimating - independently of the type of attack - the physical location of attackers, based on the location of nodes that have detected malicious activity in their neighborhood. We assume that certain countermeasures can be deployed to capture or isolate malicious nodes, and they can provide feedback on whether an attacker is actually present in a target region. We are interested in (i) estimating the minimum number of countermeasures that need to be deployed to isolate all attackers, and (ii) finding the deployment that maximizes either the expected number of attackers in the target regions or the expected number of alerts explained by the solution, subject to a constraint on the number of countermeasures. We show that these prob- lems are NP-hard, and propose two polynomial time heuristic algorithms to find approximate solutions. The feedback provided by deployed coun- termeasures is taken into account to iteratively re-deploy them until all attackers are captured. Experiments using the network simulator NS-2 show that our approach works well in practice, and both algorithms can capture over 80% of the attackers within a few deployment cycles."
1624781,13990,10228,Energy efficiency and channel allocation in P2PWRAN,2013,"IEEE 802.22 is proposed for reusing the TV channels with cognitive radio technology to build Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRANs). The cellular topology of a WRAN makes the spectrum management easy. However, this topology reduces the network capacity significantly, because in one slot only one user can be allocated with a channel. Therefore, Peer-toPeer WRAN (P2PWRAN) is proposed, in which direct CPE(Consumer Premises Equipment)-to-CPE intra-cell communication is supported. While increasing the network capacity significantly, reducing the total energy consumption is a challenge.The energy efficiency of nodes in the standard for WRAN is difficult to improve, since the transmission distance of nodes to the BS is relatively static. P2PWRAN enables to achieve higher energy efficiency through better possibilities of channel allocation. Channel allocation influences energy consumption and network capacity significantly. Channel allocation also affects the upper layers, for example the routing protocol. Therefore, guaranteeing the network performance and fairness amongst CPEs, while achieving green networks, needs cross-layer design. In this paper, we define the channel allocation problem in P2PWRAN and we recognize it as a Multi-objective Quadratic Programming (MOQP) problem. An Energy-aware Channel Allocation (ECA) algorithm is proposed for exploiting the P2PWRAN paradigm to achieve the lower communication energy consumption and higher network energy efficiency and throughput than simple greedy policies. ECA jointly considers the network layer and Media Access Control (MAC) layer. By controlling the parameters in ECA, the fairness of channel allocation can also be guaranteed."
1305477,13990,369,Increasing the Capacity of Large-Scale HetNets through Centralized Dynamic Data Offloading,2014,"Typically, mobile users cluster around points of interest in dense urban environments such as city centers forming so-called data traffic hot spots and hot zones. To provide capacity to such users efficiently, mobile operators deploy small cells. However, the deployment of heterogeneous networks, which consist of overlaying macro cells and many co-channel small cells, entails many problems. One typical problem is that, more often than not, hot spot users are not covered by the small cells due to the spatially fluctuating nature of the traffic demand. Data offloading, meaning actively shifting macro cell users to small cells, is a promising approach to address this issue. In this paper, we extend a queuing-theoretic model based on the notion of elastic data flows in order to model data offloading, or more specifically, cell range expansion along with inter-cell interference coordination. The model explicitly considers mutual co-channel interference and enables predicting the performance of networks consisting of hundreds of cells with very low computational effort. Based on this model, we present a heuristic centralized data offloading algorithm, which, for a certain traffic demand, is able to increase the 5 th percentile of the data flow throughput by a factor of 4.5 and to halve the probability of service unavailability. Moreover, we show that the network capacity can be increased by about 41.3 % if data offloading is performed.

Physical mobility of devices was becoming commonplace with the availability of cheap wireless cards, the first attempts to transform phones into personal do-it-all devices were beginning to appear, and mobile ad hoc networks were attracting a huge interest from many research communities. Logical mobility of code was still going strong as a design option for distributed systems, with the Java language providing some of the ready-to-use building blocks. In 2000, when we put forth a research “roadmap” for software engineering for mobility, the challenges posed by this dynamic scenario were many. A decade and a half later, many things have changed. Mobility is no longer exotic: we juggle multiple personal devices every day while on the move, plus we grab and update applications on a whim from virtual stores. Indeed, some trends and visions we considered in our original paper materialized, while others faded, disappeared, or morphed into something else. Moreover, some players unexpected at the time (e.g., cloud computing and online social networks) appeared on the scene as game changers. In this paper we revisit critically our original vision, reflecting on the past and peering into the future of the lively and exciting research area of mobility. Further, we ask ourselves to what extent the software engineering community is still interested in taking up the challenges mobility bears."
1329168,13990,10192,Diverse Infrastructure and Architecture for Datacenter and Cloud Resilience,2013,"Internet and web services have seen widespread adoption in recent years and are now tightly integrated into society's daily activities. An important emerging part of the Internet is clouds that provide low-cost configurable computing resources, allowing businesses to reduce their hardware, software, and personnel costs. Increasingly, enterprises now use such cloud resources to host web applications. While clouds provide an excellent business model, most existing public and private cloud infrastructures are based on monocultures that allow attackers to focus their efforts on a single hardware/software platform and facilitates the rapid spreading of successful attacks. In this invited paper, we describe a methodology and mech- anisms that make clouds and hosted applications considerably more resilient to attacks and correlated failures by introducing diversity at every level of the cloud: physical interconnect, network components, processor platforms, storage management, virtual machine monitors, operating systems, and application processes. Our goal is to defend against attacks by continuing to operate correctly even when part of the infrastructure fails and to substantially raise the difficulty of executing a successful attack by requiring the attacker to simultaneously target different hardware and software choices. Furthermore, by geographically spreading applications among different datacenters using diverse network connections (in service provider and access medium - wired vs. wireless), the cloud will be resilient against physical infrastructure attacks and large-scale disasters."
613990,13990,21066,Gibbs-sampling-based optimization for the deployment of small cells in 3G heterogeneous networks,2013,"The growing popularity of mobile data services has placed great demands for wireless cellular networks to support higher throughput. One way to meet the rapidly growing traffic demand is through heterogeneous network (HetNet) deployment, which uses a mixture of macro cells and small cells (also known as micro- or pico-cells) to further enhance the spatial reuse and thus improves network throughput. In this paper, we propose a Gibbs-sampling based optimization method for the deployment of small cells in 3G networks. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to optimize the locations of multiple small cells with the goal of maximizing a given network utility function. The Gibbs sampling based (GSB) method intelligently balances two potentially conflicting considerations: (i) placing small cells close to congested areas; and (ii) minimizing interference with the existing macro cells and other small cells. We also describe two low-complexity algorithms, the greedy EcNo and the greedy hotspot algorithms. Both algorithms are widely used in industry and will be used as the performance benchmark. Extensive simulations have been conducted based on real traffic traces from the 3G data network. The numerical results show that the GSB placement leads to 10% higher throughput and 30% higher off-loading factor than the greedy solutions. Since the cost of deploying small nodes could be expensive and each city may need a large number of small nodes, the proposed results represent significant cost savings compared to greedy solutions."
1499569,13990,8228,"Architecture and applications of a versatile small-cell, multi-service cloud radio access network using radio-over-fiber technologies",2013,"Small-cell systems based on cloud radio access network (cloud-RAN) architecture have been proposed as promising solutions to meet the ever-increasing capacity demand of the next-generation wireless access networks. By centralizing the processing power to reduce the complexity of conventional cell sites, the cloud-RAN architecture is ideal for large-scale small-cell system at reduced capital and operational expenses. However, high-speed, flexible, and scalable backhaul links between the centralized baseband processing unit (BBU) and the remote antenna units (RAUs) are required to support the high throughput of the small-cell cloud-RANs, and the conventional approaches are based on digital baseband signal transmission in the backhaul links. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-service small-cell wireless access architecture based on radio-over-fiber (RoF) technologies. By utilizing analog radio frequency (RF) signal transmission in the optical backhaul links, the design of RAUs can be further simplified. In addition, by combing RoF with optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) techniques, multiple bands, multiple services and multiple operators can coexist in a shared optical infrastructure without interference. To demonstrate the proposed system, two-operator coexistence in a shared small-cell cloud-RoF access network is implemented in an in-building testbed by using off-the-shelf optoelectronic components and commercialized WiMAX base stations and clients. In addition, the feasibility of delivering both conventional wireless services and future-proof high-RF-band services (millimeter-wave band) is also demonstrated in the proposed multi-service small-cell cloud-RoF access systems."

The equalizer jointly removes inter-symbol (ISI) as well as spatial (MIMO) interference. It is observed that in an unequal received power situation, gains over traditional MMSE frequency equal- ization can be obtained via group-based cancellation with turbo equalization. It is shown that signal co-existence is possible with this methodology and therefore QoS for cell-edge users can be maintained at considerably higher noise levels as compared to a baseline receiver. Index Terms—SC-FDMA, MMSE, MIMO, Turbo equalization, Interference cancellation. multiple access channel. This is a direct application of the chain rule of mutual information (7) and is usually called successive interference cancellation (SIC), sometimes also onion peeling decoding. However, its main drawback is a long decoding delay increasing proportionally with the number of signals in the channel. Very often those high latencies may not be tolerable in practical high-speed wireless communication systems. The remedy for that is parallel interference cancellation (PIC), where the detector aims at estimating the signals of all streams at once, running an algorithm in an iterative manner. Usually the number of iterations is much smaller than the number of signals in the channel and therefore much lower delays are possible with PIC comparing to SIC."
2031878,13990,20348,Lightweight map matching for indoor localisation using conditional random fields,2014,"Indoor tracking and navigation is a fundamental need for pervasive and context-aware smartphone applications. Although indoor maps are becoming increasingly available, there is no practical and reliable indoor map matching solution available at present. We present MapCraft, a novel, robust and responsive technique that is extremely computationally efficient (running in under 10 ms on an Android smartphone), does not require training in different sites, and tracks well even when presented with very noisy sensor data. Key to our approach is expressing the tracking problem as a conditional random field (CRF), a technique which has had great success in areas such as natural language processing, but has yet to be considered for indoor tracking. Unlike directed graphical models like Hidden Markov Models, CRFs capture arbitrary constraints that express how well observations support state transitions, given map constraints. Extensive experiments in multiple sites show how MapCraft outperforms state-of-the art approaches, demonstrating excellent tracking error and accurate reconstruction of tortuous trajectories with zero training effort. As proof of its robustness, we also demonstrate how it is able to accurately track the position of a user from accelerometer and magnetometer measurements only (i.e. gyro- and WiFi-free). We believe that such an energy-efficient approach will enable always-on background localisation, enabling a new era of location-aware applications to be developed."
2262285,13990,21066,An efficient and decentralised user association scheme for multiple technology networks,2013,"Wireless networks have emerged as the most popular access technologies. Multiple technologies like WiFi, WiMAX, LTE, along with traditional cellular networks augmented with pico and femto base stations, are available for a user to access the Internet. Many emerging user devices, e.g. smart phones, allow for Internet connectivity using most of the available technologies. Thus, at a given point in time, a user can be in the communication range of many base stations, potentially using different access technologies. This naturally gives a user a choice as to which base station he should select for network access. The association chosen by a user determines not only his own performance, but also the performance perceived by other users. Though user performances are coupled, association decisions can seldom be taken in a centralised manner. This is because different access technologies may not share the required control information and cooperate. Also, different user devices may not want to divulge their own information, for privacy or security reasons, and also on account of additional power requirement for control message exchange. Thus, one needs to devise distributed association schemes that do not require any message passing. In this paper, we consider the problem of maximising network utility subject to constraints on user requirements. To this end, we propose a distributed association scheme in which a user chooses his association based only on his own past association and the utility he obtained. We prove that it is indeed possible to achieve maximum network utility while satisfying individual user requirements in a completely distributed manner. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using simulations."
1451190,13990,369,Spectrum Reorganization and Bundling for Power Efficient Mobile Networks,2012,"Technological improvements and evolving user requirements have led to operators running and supporting three distinct wireless access technologies, GSM, UMTS, and LTE. While the most recent layer (LTE) introduces improvements in spectral efficiency and peak data rates, the remaining layers are still required for supporting legacy devices and providing wider network coverage. In order to facilitate and reduce the cost of rolling out a new network, mobile operators often reuse existing sites. Radio frequency modules in base station sites house power amplifiers, which are designed to operate within a specific frequency band. Since some access technologies have spectrum split onto multiple bands, this results in operators installing multiple modules for each access technology. This paper quantifies the power savings that can be achieved by assuming that the available spectrum for an operator can be reorganized within a single band, and have multiple carriers bundled together to fully exploit the capabilities of modern equipment. These modifications are applied on all network layers, maintaining the same number of carriers and baseband capacity. For the presented case, this results in the elimination of at least four separate modules in each site, reducing the power consumption of by 31%. Indirectly, this also translates into a reduced site space of 40%. These savings are crucial for mobile network operators to reach the energy and carbon emission targets they have committed for."
1692633,13990,9015,Monjolo: an energy-harvesting energy meter architecture,2013,"Conventional AC power meters perform at least two distinct functions: power conversion, to supply the meter itself, and energy metering, to measure the load consumption. This paper presents Monjolo, a new energy-metering architecture that combines these two functions to yield a new design point in the metering space. The key insight underlying this work is that the output of a current transformer -- nominally used to measure a load current -- can be harvested and used to  intermittently  power a wireless sensor node. The hypothesis is that the node's activation frequency increases monotonically with the primary load's draw, making it possible to estimate load power from the interval between activations, assuming the node consumes a fixed energy quanta during each activation. This paper explores this thesis by designing, implementing, and evaluating the Monjolo metering architecture. The results demonstrate that it is possible to build a meter that draws zero-power under zero-load conditions, offers high accuracy for near-unity power factor loads, works with non-unity power factor loads in combination with a whole-house meter, wirelessly reports readings to a data aggregator, is resilient to communication failures, and is parsimonious with the radio channel, even under heavy loads. Monjolo eliminates the high-voltage AC-DC power supply and AC metering circuitry present in earlier designs, enabling a smaller, simpler, safer, and lower-cost design point that supports novel deployment scenarios like non-intrusive circuit-level metering."
1172817,13990,10228,Interference protection mechanism for LTE-Advanced radio access networks supporting dynamic spectrum access,2013,"Spectrum licensing schemes are subject to fixed allocation, little sharing and long term holding, which is leading to the current problem of false scarcity. Considering current spectrum allocation methodologies and given the exponential growth of traffic demand, spectrum scarcity becomes problematic since in the near future current radio access technologies will not be able to cope with this traffic demand increase anymore. Thus, new licensing schemes must be designed to enable sharing of spectrum frequency, so that rarely used spectrum channels can be reallocated dynamically between primary users and mobile services. Cognitive radio based dynamic spectrum access is foreseen as a solution to this intricate problem. Further, simple dynamic spectrum access schemes could be integrated into an LTE-Advanced mobile network, making use of carrier aggregation and the standardized user equipment measurement reports. In this paper, we focus on geographical division of spectrum for an LTE-Advanced network, where the spectrum is classified into Frequency/Location/Time bundles. These bundles work as independent tradeable units that can be aggregated and tailored to the needs of the participants in spectrum adjudication. Geographic locations are divided into a square grid, where an estimation of the Radio Environment Map based on propagation parameters is used to assess the sets of tradeable units assigned to a given mobile network operator. Furthermore we make an analysis of how spectrum exclusion areas can be characterized and defined in order to coexist with the operator's network."

The challenge that network operators are facing is that Internet data traffic consumes considerably more resources than voice calls, necessitating in that respect significant capacity enhancements. Further, this rise in system utilization has caused a considerable increase in the energy consumption expenditure of both the access network components and the user terminals; in the former case causing a significant increase in cost, for the second case a reduction in the usability of battery operated terminals and for both cases a peak in the carbon footprint of telecoms equipment. Significant research effort has been placed recently in finding innovative solutions to support this boost in data usage demand. In this paper we detail a message forwarding strategy for cellular networks whereby capitalizing on the inherent delay tolerance of Internet type services and utilizing the mobility of nodes, intelligent information forwarding decisions can be made to achieve substantial reductions in the communication energy consumption. We devise optimal look-ahead strategies in which information on either the uplink/downlink is communicated only at the best locations within the system's coverage area to achieve a required performance target. Both analytical and experimental results are presented, showing that significant reductions on the aggregate energy consumption levels can be achieved by the proposed technique."

Our approach is to infer, from the call records, the top N locations for each user and correlate this information with publicly-available side information such as census data. For example, the measured top 2 locations likely correspond to home and work locations, the top 3 to home, work, and shopping/school/commute path locations. We consider the cases where those top N locations are measured with different levels of granularity, ranging from a cell sector to whole cell, zip code, city, county and state. We then compute the anonymity set, namely the number of users uniquely identified by a given set of top N locations at different granularity levels. We find that the top 1 location does not typically yield small anonymity sets. However, the top 2 and top 3 locations do, certainly at the sector or cell-level granularity. We consider a variety of different factors that might impact the size of the anonymity set, for example the distance between the top N locations or the geographic environment (rural vs urban). We also examine to what extent specific side information, in particular the size of the user's social network, decrease the anonymity set and therefore increase risks to privacy. Our study shows that sharing anonymized location data will likely lead to privacy risks and that, at a minimum, the data needs to be coarse in either the time domain (meaning the data is collected over short periods of time, in which case inferring the top N locations reliably is difficult) or the space domain (meaning the data granularity is strictly higher than the cell level). In both cases, the utility of the anonymized location data will be decreased, potentially by a significant amount."
1581207,13990,369,An Adaptive MIMO System Using Incremental Diversity,2013,"In the recent years, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems have emerged as a promising technology that offers reliability and spectral efficiency. Since then a great concern was devoted to enhance the performance of MIMO systems through efficient encoding and decoding techniques. Two famous MIMO approaches have emerged; Spatial Multiplexing (SM), and Space Time Block Coding (STBC). On one hand, SM offers high data rates. On the other hand, STBC presents transmission fidelity. This actually imposed a fundamental tradeoff between capacity and reliability. For a more efficient utilization of the MIMO resources, a combination between SM and STBC grasps both spectral efficiency and reliability. Hybrid SM/STBC was introduced as a MIMO system technology that offers the advantages of the two systems simultaneously. In this paper, an adaptive MIMO system that incrementally switches from multiplexing towards diversity or hybrid diversity/multiplexing is proposed. The system is initialized with a pure multiplexing mode. An error detection check is performed at the receiver side and successful detection is fed back to the transmitter via an acknowledgement. A negative acknowledgement due to false detection triggers the transmitter to incrementally switch towards the diversity mode where it sends a part of the redundancy symbols constituting an STBC or a hybrid SM/STBC - diversity mode. The incremental diversity symbols are transmitted until a positive acknowledgment is received or the transmitter exhausts its full diversity capabilities. Results indicate that, the proposed scheme combines the transmission reliability offered by MIMO diversity, while maintaining a gradual increase in the spectral efficiency in correspondence to the increase in the SNR."

It has been making up of a mass of spatially distributed autonomous sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, as known as aware of environmental technologies such as sound, water contamination, temperature, pressure, motion and other pollutants. While wireless communication becomes all sectors of daily life, the security threats to WSNs become increasingly diversified, prevention based due to the open nature of the wireless medium. An adversary can easily eavesdrop and replay or inject fabricated messages. Different cryptographic methods can be used to defend against some of such attacks but very limited due to SWN's natures. As an example, node compromised is another major problem of WSN security since it allows an adversary to enter inside the security perimeter of the network and launch attacks, which raised a serious challenge for WSNs. This paper is focusing on investigating internal attacks of WSNs with multi-hop and single sinker, by which we first present our novel protecting algorithm to WSNs with the evidences that our novel algorithm works efficiently and effectively. Our new algorithm is based on uncertain decisions, which involved in the posteriori probability of binary events represented by the beta family of density functions and Dempester Shafer theory (DST)."

In I2RV, vehicles are used as relaying terminals between eNodeB/BS and a receiving user equipment located or mounted on another traveling vehicle, for the aim of extending coverage, improving performance, and attaining distributed transmission. Initial works on cooperative vehicular communications build upon the assumption of flat and quasi-static fading channels, this can be justified only for narrowband systems in very slow traffic flows such as in rush-hours. In this paper, we consider highway traffic with high-speed mobility resulting in doubly-selective (i.e., time- and frequency-selective) channels. To overcome the performance degradation, we make use of precoded cooperative transmission accompanied with an opportunistic best-relay selection technique to extract the rich underlying multipath-Doppler-spatial diversity gains. Our performance analysis through pairwise error probability (PEP) derivation shows that, through proper precoding, the proposed system is able to extract maximum available diversity in time, frequency and space. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expressions for the outage probability as a bench-mark for future analysis for the proposed scheme. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that significant coverage advantage by extending the transmission distance targeting a specific error rate and using the same transmitting power can be achieved."
1691031,13990,8228,Mesh-DHT: A locality-based distributed look-up structure for Wireless Mesh Networks,2012,"Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) offer an elegant and fully distributed solution for reliably storing and retrieving data. Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) envision a fully decentralized fashion, and as such require efficient decentralized mechanisms for service discovery, mobility support and data storage and retrieval. Hence, DHTs and WMNs seem to complement each other nicely and even share common traits and challenges, such as multi-path routing and dynamic membership of unreliable nodes. Existing Internet-based DHT approaches are designed to emphasize performance and stability in Internet scenarios and do not consider the special conditions in WMNs. In particular, they do not focus on the impact of the physical neighbor relations of DHT nodes and assume efficient global connectivity. In contrast, in a WMN, locality of communication is essential to avoid unnecessary multi-hop data transmissions and congestion on the wireless link. We present Mesh-DHT, an approach for building a scalable DHT in WMNs that puts special emphasis on the locality of nodes and links. We construct a stable, location-aware overlay network that enables fully distributed organization of information. By design, our DHT geometry is closely aligned to the network topology of the WMN to emphasize local communication. We show that our approach preserves locality in the overlay construction, is robust against node failure, and makes efficient use of local information. These properties make our approach scalable even in the presence of hundreds of mesh nodes."
1148269,13990,22260,Pilot: Passive Device-Free Indoor Localization Using Channel State Information,2013,"Many emerging applications such as intruder detection and border protection drive the fast increasing development of device-free passive (DfP) localization techniques. In this paper, we present Pilot, a Channel State Information (CSI)-based DfP indoor localization system in WLAN. Pilot design is motivated by the observations that PHY layer CSI is capable of capturing the environment variance due to frequency diversity of wideband channel, such that the position where the entity located can be uniquely identified by monitoring the CSI feature pattern shift. Therefore, a ``passive'' radio map is constructed as prerequisite which include fingerprints for entity located in some crucial reference positions, as well as clear environment. Unlike device-based approaches that directly percepts the current state of entities, the first challenge for DfP localization is to detect their appearance in the area of interest. To this end, we design an essential anomaly detection block as the localization trigger relying on the CSI feature shift when entity emerges. Afterwards, a probabilistic algorithm is proposed to match the abnormal CSI to the fingerprint database to estimate the positions of potential existing entities. Finally, a data fusion block is developed to address the multiple entities localization challenge. We have implemented Pilot system with commercial IEEE 802.11n NICs and evaluated the performance in two typical indoor scenarios. It is shown that our Pilot system can greatly outperform the corresponding best RSS-based scheme in terms of anomaly detection and localization accuracy."
2045036,13990,22021,The impact of dark current on the wideband Poisson channel,2014,"We study the discrete-time Poisson channel under the constraint that its average input power (in photons per channel use) must not exceed some constant E.W e consider the wideband, high-photon-efficiency extreme where E approaches zero, and where the channel's dark current approaches zero proportionally with E.E xtending our previous work, we show that the influence of the dark current on channel capacity is mainly on the third-order term with respect to E.W e also show that pulse-position modulation with soft-decision decoding achieves data rates that accurately reflect such influence. I. INTRODUCTION We consider the discrete-time memoryless Poisson channel whose input x is in the set R + of nonnegative reals and whose output y is in the set Z + of nonnegative integers. Conditional on the input X = x ,t he outputY has a Poisson distribution of mean (! +x) ,w here! ! 0 is called the dark current and is a constant which does not depend on the input x .H ence the channel law W(·|·) is W(y|x )= e ! (! +x) (! + x) y y! ,x  R + 0 ,y Z + 0 . (1) This channel models pulse-amplitude modulated optical communication where the transmitter sends light signals in co- herent states (which are usually produced using laser devices), and where the receiver employs direct detection (i.e., photon counting) (1). The channel input x describes the expected number of signal photons (i.e., photons that come from the input light signal rather than noise) to be detected in the pulse duration, and is proportional to the light signal's intensity, the pulse duration, the channel's transmissivity, and the detector's efficiency; the channel output y is the actual number of photons that are detected in the pulse duration; and ! is the average number of extraneous counts that appear in y due to background radiation or to the detector's dark clicks. We impose an average-power constraint 1 on the input E(X) # E (2) for some E > 0."
1990573,13990,10228,CrowdITS: Crowdsourcing in intelligent transportation systems,2012,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and their applications are attracting significant attention in research and industry. ITS makes use of various sensing and communication technologies to assist transportation authorities and vehicles drivers in making informative decisions and provide leisure and safe driving experience. Data collection and dispersion are of utmost importance for the proper operation of ITS applications. Numerous standards, architectures and communication protocols have been anticipated for ITS applications. However, existing schemes are based on assumption that vehicles and roadside devices are equipped with sensing and communication capabilities. One of the major gaps of these approaches is their inability to capture events that can easily be logged by drivers using their mobile phones. In this paper, we propose to fill the gap by the use of Crowdsourcing in ITS namely, CrowdITS. In CrowdITS human inputs, along with available sensory data, are collected and communicated to a processing server using mobile phones. The basic idea is to use the Crowd with smart mobile phones to enable certain ITS applications without the need of any special sensors or communication devices, both in-vehicle and on-road. Alternatively, we integrate and aggregate human inputs with multiple information sources, and then selectively disseminate the aggregated information based on the driver's geo-location. Conceptually, the major change is to integrate human inputs, with multiple information sources, aggregate and finally it is localized according to the driver's geo-location. We describe the design of CrowdITS, report on the development of key ITS applications using Android and iPhone mobile phones, and outline the future work in the development of crowdsourced-based applications for intelligent transportation systems."

Infrastructure costs (BS cost, RS cost and their operational costs) of a wireless network is a key factor for network service providers while planning a network. The objective of this problem is to determine a set of BSs and RSs that can serve all users and fulfill their demands at the lowest cost. This problem settings is equally important for planning networks from scratch or enhancements in existing networks. This combinatorial optimization problem is NP-hard in nature. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are intelligent tools that can provide high quality solution to this type of problems. Usually, efficiency of EAs depends on the problem. The aim is to find effective EAs with minimum resources such as low computational complexity, processing time and number of fitness functions evaluations. We formulate this problem as a non-linear discrete optimization and introduce four recent EAs that are motivated by natural intelligent behaviors. The objective function of this planning problem is computationally costly, and there exist a tradeoff between resources and quality of solution. These algorithms include Biogeography-based Optimization (BBO) that is inspired by the natural migration phenomenon of species between different islands, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) based on the intelligent behavior of honey bee swarms, Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) from the idea of quantum computing, and Immune Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (IQEA) motivated by both the immune theory and quantum computing. Simulation results demonstrate insights of EAs' and present tradeoff between resources and quality of solutions."
961100,13990,10192,Intra-Domain Pathlet Routing,2013,"Internal routing inside an ISP network is the foundation for lots of services that generate revenue from the ISP's customers. A fine-grained control of paths taken by network traffic once it enters the ISP's network is therefore a crucial means to achieve a top-quality offer and, equally important, to enforce SLAs. Many widespread network technologies and approaches (most notably, MPLS) offer limited (e.g., with RSVP-TE), tricky (e.g., with OSPF metrics), or no control on internal routing paths. On the other hand, recent advances in the research community are a good starting point to address this shortcoming, but miss elements that would enable their applicability in an ISP's network. We extend pathlet routing by introducing a new control plane for internal routing that pursues the following qualities: it is designed to operate in the internal network of an ISP; it enables fine-grained management of network paths with suitable configuration primitives; it is scalable because routing changes are only propagated to the network portion that is affected by the changes; it supports independent configuration of specific network portions without the need to know the configuration of the whole network; it is robust thanks to the adoption of multipath routing; it supports the enforcement of QoS levels; it is independent of the specific data plane used in the ISP's network; it can be incrementally deployed and it can nicely coexist with other control planes. Besides formally introducing the dissemination mechanisms and algorithms of our control plane, we propose an experimental validation in the simulation framework OMNeT++ that we use to assess the effectiveness and scalability of our approach."
1017785,13990,208,Optimal Time-Frequency Diversity Exploitation for Multichannel System under Rayleigh Fading,2011,"In multichannel system, user could keep transmitting over an instantaneous on peak channel by opportunistically accessing and switching among channels, so as to exploit link layer time-frequency diversity. In this paper, we consider an opportunistic channel accessing/releasing scheme for maximizing system throughput in multichannel system under Rayleigh fading environment. The time-dependence of Rayleigh fading is accurately characterized by finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) model. The main goal of this paper is to devise throughput-optimal strategy for determining when to access (which) channel and when to release it. The chanllenge of the problem comes from the fact that user can never know the instantaneous quality of all channels. In fact, it has to make real time decisions purely depending on the quality of current channel and the statistics of candidate channels. We formulate this real time decision making process as a two dimension optimal stopping problem. We prove that the complexity of the two dimensional optimal stopping rule can be reduced to a simple threshold-based policy. The dynamic data transmission process under threshold-based opportunistic channel access/release strategy is then analyzed by properly constructing absorbing Markov chain. Leveraging the absorbing Markov chain theory, we attain the optimal threshold as well as maximum achievable throughput with computational efficiency. Numerical results show that our proposed channel utilization scheme achieves up to 120% throughput gain over opportunistic transmission with a single channel and up to 70% throughput gain over opportunistic channel access with constant transmission duration."
2392780,13990,343,Infrastructure Mobility: A What-if Analysis,2014,"Mobile computing has traditionally implied mobile clients connected to a static infrastructure. This paper breaks away from this point of view and envisions the possibility of injecting mobility into infrastructure. We envision a WiFi access point on wheels, that moves to optimize desired performance metrics. Movements need not necessarily be all around the floor of a home or office, neither do they have to operate on batteries, or connect wirelessly to the Internet. At homes, they could remain tethered to power and Ethernet outlets while moving in small areas (perhaps under the study table). In offices of the future, perhaps APs could move on tracks installed on top of false ceilings.   This paper explores the viability of this vision and presents early measurements from various home/office environments. We find that complex multipath characteristics of indoor environments cause large fluctuations in link quality even when the antenna moves in the scale of few centimeters. Mobile APs can leverage this spatial variation by relocating to a location that is strong for its own clients and yet weak from its interferers. Experiment results show that such micro-mobility itself can offer up to 2x throughput gains. Additional opportunities may emerge, such as in energy savings, security, QoS, and even in applications such as indoor localization. While this paper explores a small fraction of the landscape of opportunities, the results have been far more promising than what we had anticipated originally."
809129,13990,22021,Capacity of the discrete memoryless energy harvesting channel with side information,2014,"We determine the capacity of a discrete memoryless communication channel with an energy harvesting transmitter and its battery state information available at the transmitter and the receiver. This capacity is an upper bound for the problem where side information is available only at the transmitter. Since channel output feedback does not increase the capacity in this case, we equivalently study the resulting finite-state Markov chan- nel with feedback. We express the capacity in terms of directed information. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions under which the capacity expression is further simplified to include the stationary distribution of the battery state. We also obtain a single-letter expression for the capacity with battery state information at both sides and an infinite-sized battery. Lastly, we consider achievable schemes when side information is available only at the transmitter for the case of an arbitrary finite-sized battery. We numerically evaluate the capacity and achievable rates with and without receiver side information. I. INTRODUCTION We consider a communication channel with an energy har- vesting transmitter and its battery state information available at the transmitter and the receiver as shown in Fig. 1. In this channel, energy needed for communication is harvested by the transmitter throughout the communication, and the energy of each transmitted code symbol is constrained to the available battery energy in that channel use. The capacity of this channel with only transmitter side battery state information has been determined in recent work for two extreme cases in the Gaussian setting: When the battery size is unlimited, (1) showed that the capacity is equal to the capacity of the same system with an average power constraint equal to the average recharge rate. When the battery size is zero, (2) showed that the capacity is achieved by using Shannon strategies (3). In this paper, we determine the capacity of this channel for a discrete memoryless setting with an arbitrary finite battery size, when battery state information is available at both sides. This constitutes an upper bound for the capacity when battery state information is available only at the transmitter. A communication channel with an energy harvesting trans- mitter is an instance of a state-dependent channel with input dependence and memory in the state process. We model energy arrivals as multiples of a fixed quanta, and obtain a physical layer which has a discrete alphabet based on this quanta. Con- sequently, we obtain a finite-state Markov channel where the"
1419434,13990,23653,Adaptive channel bonding in multicarrier wireless networks,2013,"To support high data rate applications such as multimedia streaming, the ongoing standardization of the next generation Wi-Fi increases the channel bonding from 40 MHz in 802.11n to 80, and even 160 MHz under certain conditions in 802.11ac. However, inefficiency and unfairness issues arise when devices that use different channel widths coexist in a contention domain. A device with channel bonding has to wait until all bonded channels to be idle to commence a transmission while narrow channel interferers have more channel access opportunities. To address the inefficiency and unfairness issues in channel bonding, we propose an adaptive channel bonding (ACB) protocol in which a node is allowed to initiate a transmission as long as a narrow channel is available and gradually increase channel width during transmission whenever a new narrow channel becomes available. ACB aggregates all available narrow channels as one wide channel, removing the need of setting guard bands between contiguous narrow channels. A challenge in the design is the communication over uncertain channels. To enable fast spectrum agreement between transmitter and receiver, a partial spectrum correlation method is introduced. ACB also considers the severe contention in a wide band of spectrum. When new channels become available, multiple nodes may contend for them. A compound preamble is designed to make collisions detectable in the frequency domain and a parallel bitwise arbitration mechanism is introduced to quickly resolve the collisions in the time domain. We implemented and evaluated the ACB through the GNU Radio/USRP platform. Experimental results show that ACB can well address the inefficiency and unfairness issues caused by heterogeneous radio coexistence."
2417351,13990,8228,Maximum Likelihood Receiver for MMSE Relaying,2011,"One major goal for future wireless communication systems is a uniform user experience. In order to solve this problem, additional relay nodes can be used to support the communication. Up to now mainly two relaying functions are considered, namely Amplify-Forward (AF) and Decode-Forward (DF). DF can either mean a channel decoding at the relay or a hard decision directly on the received signal which will be called DetF here to avoid confusion. But both have certain drawbacks: AF suffers from noise amplification whereas with DetF useful information is lost due to the hard decision. For this purpose a relay function minimizing the mean squared error called Estimate-Forward (EF) has been proposed in the literature combining the benefits of AF and DetF. If more than one relay is considered or if the signal received directly from the source contains useful information, these signals should be combined properly. In the case of nonlinear functions at the relay like for DetF or EF, the disturbance of the signal received from the relay is not Gaussian any more and simple weighted linear combining like Maximum Ratio Combining for Gaussian channels is suboptimal. In this paper we will derive a Maximum Likelihood detector for EF with higher order modulation schemes. This receiver results in significant gains in terms of bit error rate and mutual information and therefore leads to a higher user throughput compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, these gains are obtained without increasing the computational complexity of the terminals significantly."
1992678,13990,8228,Delay bound analysis in real-time networks with priority scheduling using network calculus,2013,"Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in large-scale real-time computing and communication networks are supported by enabling technologies such as real time scheduling, which can be implemented by priority scheduling. In order to guarantee the hard delay bound for delay sensitive applications, worst-case analysis has been developed. Network Calculus (NC) is a well known network analysis tool as it possesses a set of properties particularly suitable for large-scale networks. In NC, the arrival process and the service process of a system are bounded by the arrival curve and the service curve, respectively. These two curves are then used to derive the bounds of performance measures. However, due to the difficulty in properly choosing the curves, original NC based on min-plus algebra is not always able to provide tight performance bounds. In this paper, we develop a NC approach based on max-plus algebra and use it to derive the upper delay bound of a network system with non-preemptive priority scheduling. In max-plus NC, the arrival curve is defined as the lower bound on the cumulative inter-arrival time and the service curve gives the upper bound on the cumulative service time. Since we derive the worst-case cumulative service time for non-preemptive priority scheduling, these definitions allow us to choose the curves in such a way that they accurately capture the main characteristics of the arrivals and services. As a result, our max-plus NC approach generates tight delay bounds. In an example Controller Area Network (CAN) system, a series of numerical results for our delay bounds turn out to be as tight as the simulated worst-case delay. Therefore we prove that NC, as a suitable analytical method for large-scale real-time networks, is capable of providing accurate performance bounds."
849400,13990,22164,Total optimisation of a media-streaming wireless terminal: Energy-efficient link adaptation under higher-layer criteria,2011,"It has long been recognised that a wireless communication system can be more efficient if link-layer parameters such as modulation order, symbol rate and packet size, are (adaptively) optimised. A common optimising criterion is to maximise spectral efficiency (bits per second per Hertz (bps/Hertz)) subject to a very low bit-error constraint. But a packet-oriented criterion for link adaptation seems more appropriate for practical communication networks fitted with strong error detection and a selective packet re-transmission mechanism. In recent work, we performed link optimisation for maximal bits per second or bits per Joule for data (delay-tolerant) traffic. In the present work, we extend our previous analysis to consider a (delay-sensitive) media streaming application (e.g. music, or video), which introduces yet another degree of freedom: the number of bits allocated to a second of the media signal (encoding rate). We consider any arbitrary combination of link-layer parameters, with the only restriction that the corresponding packet-success rate function (PSRF) is an S-curve. Under a very general optimisation criteria, we obtain a robust result for a media-streaming terminal with an adjustable symbol rate: the key is a tangent line from (0,0) to a scaled graph of the PSRF, the steeper the line (greater slope) the better the configuration. Under additional reasonable assumptions, at the optimum, both throughput per unit SNR and “fidelity” per unit rate are maximal, which is intuitively appealing."
719596,13990,208,Link-Layer Multicast in Smart Antenna Based 802.11n Wireless LANs,2013,"In wireless local area networks (WLANs), link-layer multicast is a promising technology for many multimedia applications, e.g., video conference, as multicast frames can reach multiple clients simultaneously. However, the efficiency of multicast in WLANs is unsatisfactory since multicast frames are transmitted at low data rates to reach clients with poor channel quality. Moreover, the reliability of multicast cannot be guaranteed either, as multicast transmissions are not acknowledged. Some recent works have utilized smart antennas to improve multicast performance. But most of them require customized hardware and are not designed for the latest IEEE 802.11 standard, 802.11n WLANs. In this paper, we consider link-layer multicast in 802.11n WLANs with smart antennas. We partition clients into several groups, then select an antenna pattern from smart antennas and a multicast rate for each group, and transmit the same frame to each group. We first examine the gain of smart antennas and reliability of various 802.11n data rates for multicast in indoor WLANs via experiments. We then present the system model for multicast over smart antennas and formulate the problem into a mixed integer program. After that, we propose an optimal algorithm for the mixed integer program, under the condition that the packet reception ratio (PRR) of all antenna patterns and data rates is known for every client. As clients join and leave the network frequently and the wireless channel is time varying, we also propose an on-line algorithm that is able to adapt the partition of clients, antenna pattern and multicast rate for each group dynamically, based on PRR reports from clients. We have implemented the on-line algorithm on off-the-shelf WLAN products and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance. The results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve multicast throughput compared to other strategies, and at the same time guarantee high PRR for all clients."
500839,13990,20349,ArrayTrack: a fine-grained indoor location system,2013,"With myriad augmented reality, social networking, and retail shopping applications all on the horizon for the mobile handheld, a fast and accurate location technology will become key to a rich user experience. When roaming outdoors, users can usually count on a clear GPS signal for accurate location, but indoors, GPS often fades, and so up until recently, mobiles have had to rely mainly on rather coarse-grained signal strength readings. What has changed this status quo is the recent trend of dramatically increasing numbers of antennas at the indoor access point, mainly to bolster capacity and coverage with multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. We thus observe an opportunity to revisit the important problem of localization with a fresh perspective. This paper presents the design and experimental evaluation of ArrayTrack, an indoor location system that uses MIMO-based techniques to track wireless clients at a very fine granularity in real time, as they roam about a building. With a combination of FPGA and general purpose computing, we have built a prototype of the ArrayTrack system. Our results show that the techniques we propose can pinpoint 41 clients spread out over an indoor office environment to within 23 centimeters median accuracy, with the system incurring just 100 milliseconds latency, making for the first time ubiquitous real-time, fine-grained location available on the mobile handset."
2260929,13990,8228,On Robust Weighted-Sum Rate Maximization in MIMO Interference Networks,2011,"This paper studies the \emph{robust weighted-sum rate} optimization problem in the presence of channel uncertainty over a $K$-user Gaussian Interference Channel (GIFC), where multiple antennas are present at all transmitters and receivers. Motivated by recent results on \emph{interference alignment} that show the optimality of linear precoders and simple receivers in achieving the maximum degrees-of-freedom available in the GIFC, we consider linear transmit precoding and two simple decoding schemes: single-stream decoding and single-user decoding. The resulting precoder design problems are then posed as specific optimization problems. Unfortunately, due to the hardness of these problems, optimal solutions cannot be efficiently obtained. Instead of resorting to ad-hoc algorithms, we show that it is possible to design algorithms using a systematic approach. Towards this end, this paper develops new provably convergent iterative algorithms for precoder design through ingenious sub-problem formulations such that each of these sub-problems can be solved optimally. The sub-problems are solved in closed-form for certain cases and formulated as standard convex problems for the rest. To complement these contributions on achievable schemes, we generalize the genie-MAC outer bounding technique to incorporate channel uncertainty using notions of compound-MAC capacity and then obtain computable outer bounds using an alternating optimization approach. Thus, we introduce one of the first approaches to obtain tighter outer bounds on the capacity region of the GIFC in the presence of channel uncertainty."
917580,13990,10228,Enhancing the efficiency of cluster-based networks through MISO techniques,2012,"Towards the realization of the Internet of Things (IoT), cellular networks are expected to play a fundamental role, providing the ubiquitous coverage and global internetworking. However, due to the physical limitations, namely energy consumption or hardware complexity, of many of these objects, the direct communication with the cellular infrastructure is hindered. In this sense, cluster-based networks have been introduced as an efficient solution, offering coverage extension and energy savings. The energy efficiency and performance of these networks can be further enhanced if the devices can choose between two or more cluster-heads towards their connection to the infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel cluster-head (CH) selection algorithm, where the nodes can switch between different CHs, according to the corresponding signal strength, in order to maintain a predefined quality of service constraint. We show that the network reliability significantly increases, especially when considering mobile scenarios, where the connection to a CH may be not feasible, due to shadowing. In addition, the CHs are equipped with multiple antennas for enhanced performance. The performance of this scheme is theoretically investigated over correlated Nakagami-m multipath fading channels, subject also to shadowing. By considering Gamma distributed shadow effects, convenient expressions for important statistical metrics are obtained. The theoretical analysis is accompanied by representative performance evaluation results, complemented by equivalent computer simulated ones, which validate the accuracy of the proposed analysis."
1674151,13990,208,"EDAL: An Energy-Efficient, Delay-Aware, and Lifetime-Balancing Data Collection Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks",2013,"In many wireless sensor network (WSN) applications, a subset of nodes (source nodes) are selected to sense the environment, generate data, and transmit them back to the sink over multiple hops. Many previous research efforts have tried to achieve trade-offs in terms of delay, energy cost, and load balancing for such data collection tasks. Our work in this paper stems from the insight that, recent research efforts on open vehicle routing (OVR) problems, an active area in operations research, are based on similar assumptions and constraints compared to sensor networks. This insight motivates us to adapt these techniques so that we can solve or prove certain challenging problems in WSN applications. To demonstrate that this approach is feasible, we develop one data collection protocol called EDAL, which stands for Energy-efficient Delay-aware Lifetime-balancing data collection. The algorithm design of EDAL borrows one research result from OVR to prove that its problem formulation is inherently NP-hard. We then proposed both a centralized heuristic to reduce its computational overhead, and a distributed heuristic to make the algorithm scalable for large scale network operations. We also develop EDAL to be closely integrated with compressive sensing, an emerging technique that promises considerable reduction in total traffic cost for collecting sensor readings under loose delay bounds. Finally, we systematically evaluate EDAL to demonstrate its performance superiority compared to related protocols."
1898697,13990,8228,Cost-Optimized Planning for Supporting 100 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s Services over Channel Count-Limited Optical Transport Networks,2011,"The increasing traffic demand resulting from the widespread use of information and communication technologies is impelling network operators to upgrade the capacity of their existing transport network facilities. Recent advances in the scientific community have led to the first developments in serial 100 Gb/s technology that could provide an adequate solution for solving the capacity expansion problem. Nevertheless, given the complexity of 100 Gb/s transceiver equipment, the initial costs may refrain early adoption of the technology, leading carriers to invest in more cost-effective alternatives. Embedded in the optical transport network (OTN) functionality portfolio, traffic grooming and virtual concatenation can be exploited in order to optimally combine 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s equipment for supporting mixed line rate (MLR) demands. Hence, this work proposes an optimization framework for designing optical transport infrastructures with the objective of minimizing the network costs directly related to transceiver and regenerator equipment. The framework models the problem via an integer linear programming formulation that takes into account the relative cost, the maximum optical reach, and the capacity of each optical interface, as well as the optical channel limit per fiber link. As a result, the proposed method is able to select the equipment type and the routing path for each connection which correspond to the most cost-effective solution satisfying the 100G and 40G service demands."
1981592,13990,8228,Greedy and progressive user scheduling for CoMP wireless networks,2012,"In this work, we propose progressive user scheduling (PUS) and distributed successive zero-forcing (SZF) precoding for clustered coordinated multi-point transmission/reception (CoMP) systems. With joint transmission (JT) across a cluster of cells, centralized processing of precoding and user scheduling requires significant bandwidth resources for information exchange among coordinated base stations (BTSs) and the central controller, and channel state information (CSI) feedback from all users in the cluster to the central controller. In this work, we propose a greedy progressive user scheduling (PUS) and distributed SZF precoding to reduce CSI feedback and information exchange. With PUS, each BTS schedules and precodes its users in the coverage area of its cell separately from other BTSs in a cluster, but takes limited amount of feedback information available from other BTSs into account for user scheduling. Once the users are scheduled in that cell, BTS passes precoder information of the scheduled users to the next BTS. The second BTS schedules users in its cell taking the information from the first BTS into account. This process continues until the last BTS in the cluster schedules its users. With PUS, users in a cell do not completely estimate CSI from other cells in the cluster, which may significantly reduce the CSI feedback. Also, central controller is not necessarily required, but it may be utilized for limited amount of control signalling, e.g. an order in which the BTSs should schedule their users. Due to its distributed implementation, the proposed technique enables the use of various existing single-cell multiuser MIMO techniques that have been already standardized or proposed in the literature. In this work, we investigate the performance of greedy PUS and compare it with the greedy user selection for JT. It is shown that PUS can achieve sum rate close to the JT technique."
1307295,13990,208,QoS-Aware Wireless Back-Haul Network for Rural Areas with Support for Broadcast Services in Practice,2011,"Rural areas in emerging or developed countries often lack affordable broadband Internet connectivity. Especially in emerging countries this limits the access to knowledge, government services, etc. The major limiting factors are the CAPEX and especially the OPEX related to traditional wireless carrier equipment, the vast and sparsely populated areas as well as the relatively large energy footprint of such equipment. Since in many rural regions access to a power grid is not available or highly instable, ensuring a 24/7 operation of a cell site is a very costly task. To address these issues we have developed a carrier-grade heterogeneous multi-radio back-haul architecture which may be deployed to extend, complement or even replace traditional operator equipment. Our Wireless Back-Haul (WiBACK) network technology extends the wireless back-haul coverage while building on cost-effective and low-power equipment. In this paper we first present a pilot scenario in Maseru, Lesotho, where an entrepreneur starts out with three eKiosk/VoIP sites with the goal of covering large parts of the city of Maseru. Using a testbed resembling the initial setup and identical hardware as planned for Maseru, we evaluate the QoS-related performance of this WiBACK-based network and show that we can meet the QoS demands of the eKiosk/VoIP systems even under heavy load and that the system is capable to support the planned future network growth."
1250345,13990,10162,What does model-driven data acquisition really achieve in wireless sensor networks?,2012,"Model-driven data acquisition techniques aim at reducing the amount of data reported, and therefore the energy consumed, in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). At each node, a model predicts the sampled data; when the latter deviate from the current model, a new model is generated and sent to the data sink. However, experiences in real-world deployments have not been reported in the literature. Evaluation typically focuses solely on the quantity of data reports suppressed at source nodes: the interplay between data modeling and the underlying network protocols is not analyzed. In contrast, this paper investigates in practice whether i) model-driven data acquisition works in a real application; ii) the energy savings it enables in theory are still worthwhile once the network stack is taken into account. We do so in the concrete setting of a WSN-based system for adaptive lighting in road tunnels. Our novel modeling technique, Derivative-Based Prediction (DBP), suppresses up to 99% of the data reports, while meeting the error tolerance of our application. DBP is considerably simpler than competing techniques, yet performs better in our real setting. Experiments in both an indoor testbed and an operational road tunnel show also that, once the network stack is taken into consideration, DBP triples the WSN lifetime—a remarkable result per se, but a far cry from the aforementioned 99% data suppression. This suggests that, to fully exploit the energy savings enabled by data modeling techniques, a coordinated operation of the data and network layers is necessary."
1021660,13990,22021,Classical communication rates for simulating quantum resources,2013,"Quantum theory is, in some sense, “non-classical.” For instance, the behavior of entangled systems (i.e., shared quantum information) under measurements cannot, in general, be explained by shared classical information. With classical communication, on the other hand, both the correlations entanglement leads to as well as quantum channels can be reproduced in principle. Here, crucial questions are whether the required communications is finite; if so, then its exact amount is related to the “degree of non-classicality” of the quantum primitive. We apply information-theoretic results such as the reverse Shannon theorem for determining the required communication in the asymptotic limit. The communication complexity of a quantum channel is the minimal amount of classical communication required for classically simulating the process of preparation, transmission through the channel, and subsequent measurement of a quantum state. At present, only little is known about this quantity. Our generic procedure allows for systematically evaluating the communication complexity of channels in any general probabilistic theory, in particular quantum theory. The procedure is constructive and provides the most efficient classical protocols. We illustrate it by evaluating the communication complexity of sending single qubits over a noiseless quantum channel with some finite sets of quantum states and measurements. As a second application, we determine the classical-communication rate required for the simulation of the behavior under measurements of entangled states. Here, the communication cost can be directly interpreted as the “non-classicality” of the correlation. A particular example is the simulation of non-maximally entangled pure qubit pairs, where we find the required communication rate to behave monotonically with the strength of the entanglement. For different measures of non-locality, such as the number of required non-local (PR) boxes, another behavior had been reported for the single-shot scenario."

In the former case, a relay node has no idea of the message reception status and will carry and forward the message until meeting the destination, while the latter could efficiently notify all relay nodes but demands extra communication resources. Different from previous studies, we consider in this paper an explicit probabilistic stopping mechanism for relay nodes. Under such mechanism, a relay node that is actively disseminating a message will stop spreading the message with a certain probability, after meeting another node having already received the message. We first develop a two-dimensional Markov chain framework to characterize the highly complicated dynamics until the end of message propagation, then conduct Markovian analysis to derive the associated important performance metrics, including the average time required for the completion of message propagation, the expectation and variance of the fraction of nodes finally receiving the message, and the probability that a given number of nodes end up with the message, etc. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to analytically explore how the network parameter settings may affect these performance metrics."
951387,13990,8228,Multi-channel data communication through thick metallic barriers,2012,"This paper explores the use of multiple communication channels to transmit data at high rates, without physical penetrations, through thick metallic barriers using ultrasound. Two parallel acoustic-electric channels are formed in close proximity utilizing two pairs of coaxially aligned piezoelectric transducers mounted on, and acoustically coupled to, opposing sides of a metal wall. Each channel employs orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) which can achieve a high spectral efficiency in frequency selective channels. The two-transmitter-two-receiver MIMO configuration is studied and analytical expressions of channel capacity are determined for the raw channels as well as for several co-channel interference cancellation techniques and they are verified using a Monte-Carlo simulation. It is shown that excessive crosstalk between the channels can lead to marginal increases or decreases in capacity over the single channel when no interference suppression is used. Several interference cancellation structures, including zero forcing, eigenmode transmission, and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) are investigated to mitigate this effect. It is shown that their aggregate capacity may approximately double that of either channel used independently. It is also determined that, in a relatively static MIMO acoustic-electric channel, a minimal complexity adaptive approach such as the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm may be used while achieving a similar capacity to more complex structures."
2382065,13990,10228,A utility based resource allocation scheme with delay scheduler for LTE service-class support,2012,"LTE standard defines strict requirements for service classes in order to provide end users with exceptional QoS characteristics including fast connectivity and high data rates. However there is no standard scheduling algorithm defined for LTE and the task of protecting end user satisfaction while maintaining service class restrictions is left upon the service provider and currently is an open issue. To address this challenge, in this work we proposed a two-level scheduler with a utility based game theoretic application in the first level that distributes physical resource blocks among classes with different QoS requirements and a delay based air interface scheduling algorithm in the second level that satisfies the strict levels of delay budget requirements defined for LTE classes. A cooperative game is formed between different service class flows by use of a sigmoid utility function that allows for distribution of resources. Lagrangian formulation is used to find the associated Pareto Optimality. The delay based scheduler checks each user's packet delay in its respective service class and makes scheduling decisions in the downlink direction utilizing current channel conditions. Simulation results carried out with key performance matrices including throughput, packet loss ratio, system delay and fairness index proved the usefulness and efficacy of the proposed approach as compared to existing Proportional Fair, Exponential Rule and M-LWDF algorithms."
1659878,13990,8839,Demo: Luxapose: indoor positioning with mobile phones and visible light,2014,"We explore the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires. The luminaires-modified to allow rapid, on-off keying-transmit their identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical pulses. A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image, decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires. Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position updates. The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be solved with optimization techniques. We explore the feasibility of the design through an analytical model, demonstrate the viability of the design through a prototype system, discuss the challenges to a practical deployment including usability and scalability, and demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in both carefully controlled and more realistic human mobility scenarios."
1271757,13990,8228,Hierarchical video caching in wireless cloud: Approaches and algorithms,2012,"We had introduced video caching techniques in the Radio Access Network (RAN) in [1] as a way to reduce the need to bring requested videos from Internet CDNs, thus reducing overall backhaul traffic, improving video quality of experience and increasing network capacity to support more simultaneous video requests. In this paper, we investigate supplementing the resulting wireless cloud with a hierarchical caching scheme, where the gateways in the Core Network (CN) also have video caches. The hierarchical caching approach further improves network capacity by enabling multiple cell sites to share caches at higher levels of the hierarchy, thereby improving overall cache hit ratio, without increasing the total cache size used. In addition, we exploit hierarchical caching to better accommodate mobility, so that when a user with an active video session moves from one cell to a neighboring cell, it is likely that the video currently being downloaded is already in a cache within the RAN or CN network associated with the new cell. To achieve the goal of improving capacity and supporting mobility, we extend our User Preference Profile (UPP) based caching policies [1] to accommodate the hierarchical caching structure introduced in this paper. For all the videos that miss the cache in any layer of hierarchy, we propose a scheduling approach to allocate RAN and CN backhaul resources judiciously so as to maximize the capacity of the wireless network. We extend our discrete event statistical simulation framework developed in [1] to study the performance of the proposed hierarchical caching approach. Our simulation results show that using hierarchical caching can enhance cache hit ratio by 24% and network capacity by up to 45% compared to caching only in the RAN. Significant capacity gains are also observed when additionally considering user mobility."
1494121,13990,8228,A robust MDP approach to secure power control in cognitive radio networks,2012,"Power control plays a key role in realizing reliable and spectrum-efficient communications in a cognitive radio network. In this paper we study secure power control schemes for cognitive radios via a robust Markov decision process (MDP) approach. We first use the discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) model to characterize the primary user's (PU) activities as well as the dynamics of the fading channel. The resulting power control problem can be optimally solved by a dynamic programming (DP) approach. The presence of malicious users, however, necessitates a cooperative spectrum sensing approach that requires extra signal processing and information exchange efforts to identify false spectrum sensing reports. Such a cooperative approach incurs considerable delay in spectrum sensing that may significantly deteriorate the performance of the DP strategy. Furthermore, the false sensing data generated by malicious users may give rise to erroneous estimation of the transition probabilities. Consequently, the solution obtained based on the estimated transition matrices may exhibit poor performance. To cope with these challenges, we propose a framework of power control schemes based on the robust MDP approach that is capable of achieving reasonably good performance when both spectrum sensing delay and estimation errors are present. The tradeoffs between the robustness, the achievable throughput, and the sensing delay are also discussed. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed power control strategies."
1104143,13990,8806,A flow-based optimization model for throughput-oriented relay node placement in wireless sensor networks,2013,"This work addresses the relay node placement problem in wireless sensor networks. We consider a scenario in which all sensor nodes stream data towards sink nodes. Additional relay nodes can be placed with the aim of optimizing overall network performance in terms of data throughput. We formalize the problem with a linear, mixed integer mathematical programming model. We include a number of constraints and penalties to closely model the wireless environment. When relay nodes can be placed anywhere, we define their possible locations using a discrete grid. Model solutions specify both where to place the relays and the paths for routing. Through extensive simulation experiments, we compare model solutions against a state-of-the-art dynamic routing protocol to assess the quality of the routes, and against a relay node placement heuristic to evaluate relay positioning. To tackle the computational complexity, we also propose and study the effect of different strategies for determining the grid resolution.   Additionally, an experimental validation carried out in a real testbed shows that the computed solutions clearly increase network performance by enabling the reception of larger number of data packets at the sinks and determining a fair QoS distribution among the nodes. Finally, we propose an on-line application, in which the model is built and solved on-demand, to adapt to changes in traffic patterns induced by external events, and the results are rapidly spread throughout the network and used to modify relay node positioning and routing paths."

The Third Generation Partnership Project-Long Term Evolution (3GPPLTE) has standardized multiple access (MA) schemes for 4G cellular networks. Two advanced schemes, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA), have been adopted for downlink and uplink, respectively.Optimization-based approaches play a crucial role in network operation and resource management. The optimization problems considered in this thesis are addressed in four research papers. For the single cell scenario, the optimization problems of joint power and channel allocation in OFDMA and consecutive-channel assignment in SCFDMA are investigated in Papers I, II, and III. For the OFDM-based multi-cell scenario, an energy minimization problem is addressed in Paper IV.In the thesis, theoretical analysis, algorithm development, and numerical studies are carried out. Mathematical optimization is applied as the main approach to facilitate the problem solving. In Paper I, we evaluate the performance gain and loss for various allocation policies in the OFDMA system. In Papers II and III, resource allocation algorithms are proposed to obtain competitive and high-quality solutions for consecutive-channel allocation problems in the SC-FDMA system. The theoretical analysis and the proposed algorithm in Paper IV provide optimal solution for energy minimization."
1501698,13990,22021,List-decoding of subspace codes and rank-metric codes up to Singleton bound,2012,"Subspace codes and rank-metric codes can be used to correct errors and erasures in network, with linear network coding. Both types of codes have been extensively studied in the past five years. Subspace codes were introduced by Koetter and Kschischang to correct errors and erasures in networks where topology is unknown (the non-coherent case). In this model, the codewords are vector subspaces of a fixed ambient space; thus codes for this model are collections of such subspaces. In a previous work, we have developed a family of subspace codes, based upon the Koetter-Kschichang construction, which are efficiently list decodable. Using these codes, we achieved a better decoding radius than Koetter-Kschischang codes at low rates. Herein, we introduce a new family of subspace codes based upon a different approach which leads to a linear-algebraic list-decoding algorithm. The resulting error-correction radius can be expressed as follows: for any integer s, our list-decoder using s + 1-variate interpolation polynomials guarantees successful recovery of the message sub-space provided the normalized dimension of errors is at most s(1 − sR). The same list-decoding algorithm can be used to correct erasures as well as errors. The size of output list is at most Q s − 1 , where Q is the size of the field that message symbols are chosen from. Rank-metric codes are suitable for error correction in the case where the network topology and the underlying network code are known (the coherent case). Gabidulin codes are a well-known class of algebraic rank-metric codes that meet the Singleton bound on the minimum rank-distance of a code. In this paper, we introduce a folded version of Gabidulin codes analogous to the folded Reed-Solomon codes of Guruswami and Rudra along with a list-decoding algorithm for such codes. Our list-decoding algorithm makes it possible to recover the message provided that the normalized rank of error is at most 1 − R − ∊, for any ∊ > 0. Notably this achieves the information theoretic bound on the decoding radius of a rank-metric code."
738884,13990,20348,Low power counting via collaborative wireless communications,2013,"Metrics that aggregate the state of neighboring nodes are frequently used in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we present two primitives that exploit simultaneous communications in 802.15.4 radios to enable a polling node to calculate with low power the number (or set) of its neighbors where some state predicate of interest holds. In both primitives, the poller assigns transmission powers and response lengths to its respective neighbors for their simultaneous response to each of its poll requests. The two primitives adopt complementary schemes for power assignment such that the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the respective signal from each neighbor is significantly different from that of all others in one primitive and nearly equivalent to that of the others in the other. The first primitive, LinearPoll, suits sparse networks and consumes energy that is linear in the size of its neighborhood, whereas the second primitive, LogPoll, suits dense networks and consumes constant energy. Compared to the state-of-the-art solutions that use multiple sub-carriers, our primitives are simpler and more compute-efficient while provide estimation with comparable quality. Compared to single-carrier solutions, our primitives achieve comparable quality at less than half the energy cost or richer information at comparable energy cost. They are also compatible with other radio physical layers. Based on our implementation for CC2420 radios on the TelosB platform, we evaluate the primitives in different wireless environments and neighborhood topologies to study their performance, the tradeoff between their estimation accuracy and energy cost, and methods for tuning their critical parameters, and we compare them with baseline counting protocols."
921283,13990,10228,Compressive Sensing based on local regional data in Wireless Sensor Networks,2012,"In order to save energy of sensors in the process of gathering data and transmitting information, Compressive Sensing (CS), as a novel and effective signal transform technology, has been used gradually in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In traditional usages of CS techniques in the previous literatures, the sparsities of the signals has to be known beforehand, which is much more importance for their recover results. However, it is difficult to realize precisely the structures of the signals actually in WSNs. Therefore, it is important to further exploit reasonable practicality availability in actual applications. In order to reduce energy of gathering and transmitting of sensors, this paper presents a model of optimized CS based on local regional data and design two corresponding algorithms, which could reconstruct the signals accurately and stably even if their sparsities could not be known in advance. Most important, our algorithms just need once extra transmission by sensors In the paper, we present two reasonable assumptions and then propose spatial-temporal correlation model for optimizing measure matrix of CS. Furthermore, two algorithms are designed in two kinds of situations that data satisfy random distribution or Gauss distribution, which is common in actual applications. According to experiments in the cases of both real data based on actual environments and two kinds of signals above based on simulation environments, our algorithm has been proved to be valuable for actual applications. Especially, when the amount of the sampling is only 15 with the dimension of the data is 256 and the sparsity is unknown, the relative error rate could be less than 6% in actual environments and 3.5% in simulation environments."
2278606,13990,22164,Dynamic best spectral bands selection for face recognition,2014,"In this paper, face recognition in uncontrolled illumination conditions is investigated. A twofold contribution is proposed. First, three state-of-art algorithms, namely Multiblock Local Binary Pattern (MBLBP), Histogram of Gabor Phase Patterns (HGPP) and Local Gabor Binary Pattern Histogram Sequence (LGBPHS) are evaluated upon the IRIS-M 3  face database to study their robustness against a high illumination variation conditions. Second, we propose to use visible multispectral images, provided by the same face database, to enhance the performance of the three mentioned algorithms. To reduce the high data dimensionality introduced by the use of multispectral images, we have designed a system to dynamically select the best spectral bands for each new subject. Our semi-supervised system for best spectral bands selection learn the relation between the recognition performance of each spectral band and its intrinsic quality using techniques of transfer learning and finite mixture of Gaussian for data distribution estimation. The obtained model is function of the image quality, and for each new spectral band, the likelihood ratio test is used to determine if the former belongs to either the set of good spectral bands or bad spectral bands. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system proposed to dynamically select the best visible spectral bands for face recognition. Our results highlighted further the still challenging problem of face recognition in conditions with high illumination variation, as well as the effectiveness of our subspectral images based approach to increase the accuracy of the studied algorithms by at least 21.66 % upon the proposed database. Finally, our dynamic system has shown a superiority of performance over non-dynamic systems developed for the same face database."
746850,13990,369,Path-Loss and Car-Body-Effect Characterization for Smart Tires Communications at UWB and ISM Bands,2014,"Next generation of smart tires will improve the safety and stability of the vehicle by monitoring road parameters, such as pavement and rolling conditions, with sensors placed on tire surface. Between the tread and the metal belt of the tire there are only few millimeters of rubber, therefore high miniaturization is necessary to withstand at the extremely high accelerations and to fit in this very limited room. Such kind of miniaturization poses huge limitations on antenna efficiency and available power likely provided by energy scavengers. Therefore, the optimization of the wireless power budget is crucial and it passes through the study of the communication channel. This paper presents a characterization setup that measures the path-loss from the tire surface to the inside of the car where the standard RF receivers, such as RKE at 434 MHz and Bluetooth at 2.4 GHz, are usually located. A calibration procedure has been employed in order to de-embed car-body-effects from the overall path-loss. Moreover, a 4.1 GHz UWB radio has also been considered in this study motivated by the extremely low-power consumption reached by UWB transmitters. The measurement results reflect a complex propagation environment where the car body attenuation plays a marginal role. Instead, the antenna pattern and the reflections from the environment cause the largest attenuation. Moreover, the observed link budget margin is larger and more suitable for implementation within the ISM bands than for the UWB band."
975963,13990,208,VICO: A framework for configuring indoor visible light communication networks,2012,"Visible light communications (VLC) are gaining popularity and may provide an alternative means of communications in indoor settings. However, to date, there is very little research on the deployment or higher layer protocol design for VLC. In this paper, we first perform channel measurements using a physical layer testbed in the visible light band to understand its physical layer characteristics. Our measurements suggest that in order to increase data rates with VLC (1) the beam width of a communicating link can be shrunk, and (2) the transmission beam can be tuned to point towards the target recipient. We then perform Matlab simulations to verify that the human eye is able to accommodate the changes brought by shrinking a beam or by tuning the beam direction appropriately. As our main contribution, we then design a configuration framework for a VLC indoor local area network, which we call VICO; we leverage the above features towards achieving the highest throughput while maintaining fairness. VICO first tunes the beamwidths and pointing angles of the transmitters to configurations that provide the highest throughput for each client. It then tries to schedule transmissions while accounting for conflicts and the VLC PHY characteristics. Finally, it opportunistically tunes the idle LEDs to reinforce existing transmissions to increase throughput to the extent possible. We perform extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of VICO. We find that VICO provides as much as 5-fold increase in throughput compared to a simple scheduler that does not exploit the possible variations in beamwidth or beam-angle."
1669695,13990,22021,Wireless information transfer with opportunistic energy harvesting,2012,"Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the flat-fading channel subject to the time-varying co-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy via WEH from the unintended interference and/or the intended signal sent by the transmitter. We further assume a single-antenna receiver that can only decode information or harvest energy at any given time due to the practical circuit limitation. As a result, it is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two modes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the instantaneous channel and interference conditions. In this paper, we derive the optimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various tradeoffs between the minimum transmission outage probability for ID and the maximum average harvested energy for EH, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called “outage-energy” region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmit power control and scheduling for information and energy transfer with the receiver's mode switching. Our results provide useful insights to the optimal design of emerging wireless communication systems powered by opportunistic WEH."

1502143,13990,369,Impact of Backhaul Subframe Misalignment on Uplink System Performance of LTE-Advanced Relay Networks,2012,"Most work on relaying uplink assumes a strictly synchronized subframe partitioning between relay and access links among all eNBs. However, according to 3GPP guidelines eNBs can independently decide on different backhaul subframe configurations to adapt to, e.g. traffic variations, which then implies a backhaul subframe misalignment in the system. This configuration results in a new type of interference, referred to as relay-to-relay interference. In general, uplink interference characteristics will be significantly different compared to conventional fully synchronized configuration since the transmissions of relays and user equipments will interfere with each other. Accordingly, uplink power control parameters should be properly adjusted. In this work, we evaluate the impact of backhaul subframe misalignment on the uplink system performance of relay deployments within the LTE-Advanced framework considering 4 and 10-relay urban and suburban deployments. Besides, we investigate different inter eNB coordination and subframe alignment scenarios. Comprehensive results show that a backhaul subframe misalignment can cause severe losses especially in cell coverage depending on the degree of coordination possible, and the availability of directional antennas at relays for backhauling. It is further shown that a proper power control optimization can cope with such performance degradations in urban deployments. As the cell-edge eNB-served user equipments are power limited in suburban deployments, the impact of power control optimization can be limited. Therefore, relay cell range extension is as well utilized in suburban deployments so that these user equipments are then served by relays. However, the performance degradation cannot be fully compensated by power control and cell range extension in suburban deployments, and thus a certain level of inter-eNB coordination is necessary."

The performance of Transmission Control Protocols (TCP) in such wireless ad hoc networks is plagued by a number of problems: frequent link failures, scalability, multi-hop data transmission and data loss. In this work, we make use of the vehicle's movement pattern, vehicle density, vehicle velocity and vehicle fading conditions to develop a hybrid, multi-path ant colony based routing algorithm, Mobility Aware Zone based Ant Colony Optimization Routing for VANET (MAZACORNET). that exhibits locality and scalability. We use ACO to find multiple routes between nodes in the network to aid in link failures. To achieve scalability we partition the network into multiple zones. We use proactive approach to find a route within a zone and reactive approach to find routes between zones using the local information stored in each zone thereby trying to reduce broadcasting and congestion. Our proposed algorithm makes effective use of the network bandwidth, is scalable and is robust to link failures. The results show that the algorithm works well for dense networks. The algorithm produces better delivery ratio and is scalable for zones beyond four. When compared to other existing VANET algorithms, the hybrid algorithm proved to be more efficient in terms of packet delivery ratio and end to end delay. To our knowledge this is the first ant based routing algorithm for VANET that uses the concept of zones."
906774,13990,20348,"Think globally, act locally: on the reshaping of information landscapes",2013,"In large-scale resource-constrained systems, such as wireless sensor networks, global objectives should be ideally achieved through inexpensive local interactions. A technique satisfying these requirements is information potentials, in which distributed functions disseminate information about the process monitored by the network. Information potentials are usually computed through local aggregation or gossiping. These methods however, do not consider the topological properties of the network, such as node density, which could be exploited to enhance the performance of the system. This paper proposes a novel aggregation method with which a potential becomes sensitive to the network topology. Our method introduces the notion of affinity spaces, which allow us to uncover the deep connections between the aggregation scope (the radius of the extended neighborhood whose information is aggregated) and the network's Laplacian (which captures the topology of the connectivity graph). Our study provides two additional contributions: (i) It characterizes the convergence of information potentials for static and dynamic networks. Our analysis captures the impact of key parameters, such as node density, time-varying information, as well as of the addition (or removal) of links and nodes. (ii) It shows that information potentials are decomposed into wave-like eigenfunctions that depend on the aggregation scope. This result has important implications, for example it prevents greedy routing techniques from getting stuck by eliminating local-maxima. Simulations and experimental evaluation show that our main findings hold under realistic conditions, with unstable links and message loss."
2040240,13990,22021,"Estimation in slow mixing, long memory channels",2013,"We consider estimation of binary channels with memory where the transition probabilities (channel parameters) from the input to output are determined by prior outputs (state of the channel). While the channel is unknown, we observe the joint input/output process of the channel - we have n i.i.d. input bits and their corresponding outputs. Motivated by applications related to the backplane channel, we want to estimate the channel parameters as well as the stationary probabilities for each state. Two distinct problems complicate estimation in this setting: (i) long memory, and (ii) slow mixing which could happen even with only one bit of memory. In this setting, any consistent estimator can only converge pointwise over the model class. Namely, given any estimator and any sample size n, the underlying model could be such that the estimator performs poorly on a sample of size n with high probability. But can we look at a length-n sample and identify if an estimate is likely to be accurate? Since the memory is unknown a-priori, a natural approach, known to be consistent, is to estimate a potentially coarser model with memory k n  = α n  log n, where α n  is a function that grows O(1). Note however that (i) the coarser model is estimated using only samples from the true model; and (ii) we want the best possible answers with a length-n sample, rather than just consistency. Combining results on universal compression and Aldous' coupling arguments, we obtain sufficient conditions (even for slow mixing models) to identify when naive (i) estimates of the channel parameters and (ii) estimates related to the stationary probabilities of the channel states are accurate, and bound their deviations from true values."

Leveraging existing off-the-shelf hardware (MicaZ motes, MDA300CA data acquisition board, and EC-5 soil moisture sensors), the dominant open source embedded operating systems software (TinyOS 2.1.1), and MViz, we have built a prototype WSN to collect soil moisture.

Limited battery supply is a major concern when utilizing WSNs to build realistic applications. Therefore, we utilize solar panels and rechargeable battery to address this challenging problem. We illustrate our detailed design to package WSN nodes for outdoor development and present collected data to validate our design.

Given the increasing computing capabilities of smartphones, these idle phones constitute a sizeable computing infrastructure. Therefore, for an enterprise which supplies its employees with smartphones, we argue that a computing infrastructure that leverages idle smartphones being charged overnight is an energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative to running tasks on traditional server infrastructure. While parallel execution and scheduling models exist for servers (e.g., MapReduce), smartphones present a unique set of technical challenges due to the heterogeneity in CPU clock speed, variability in network bandwidth, and lower availability compared to servers.   In this paper, we address many of these challenges to develop CWC---a distributed computing infrastructure using smartphones. Specifically, our contributions are: (i) we profile the charging behaviors of real phone owners to show the viability of our approach, (ii) we enable programmers to execute parallelizable tasks on smartphones with little effort, (iii) we develop a simple task migration model to resume interrupted task executions, and (iv) we implement and evaluate a prototype of CWC (with 18 Android smartphones) that employs an underlying novel scheduling algorithm to minimize the makespan of a set of tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that the performance of our approach makes our vision viable. Further, we explicitly evaluate the performance of CWC's scheduling component to demonstrate its efficacy compared to other possible approaches."

If each of the component codes encodes K independent complex symbols and is of transmission duration T, the rate of the FFS is K/T complex symbols per channel use. Although a number of FFSs are available in the literature that provably achieve full-diversity, there is no known universal criterion to determine whether a given arbitrary FFS achieves full-diversity or not. Further, all known full-diversity FFSs for T  t  where N t  is the number of transmit antennas, have rate at the most 1. In this paper a universal necessary condition for any FFS to achieve full-diversity is given, using which the notion of Feedback-Transmission duration optimal (FT-optimal) FFSs-schemes that use minimum amount of feedback N given the transmission duration T, and minimum transmission duration given the amount of feedback to achieve full-diversity-is introduced. When there is no feedback (N = 1) an FT-optimal scheme consists of a single STBC with T = N t , and the proposed necessary condition reduces to the well known necessary and sufficient condition for an STBC to achieve full-diversity, viz. every non-zero codeword difference matrix of the STBC must be of rank N t . Also, a sufficient condition for full-diversity is given for those FFSs in which the component STBC yielding the largest minimum Euclidean distance is chosen. Using this sufficient condition, full-rate (rate N t ) full-diversity FT-optimal schemes are constructed for all (N t , T, N) with NT = N t . These are the first full-rate full-diversity FFSs reported in the literature for T  t . Simulation results show that the new schemes have the best error performance among all known FFSs."
1471290,13990,23757,Centrality and mode detection in dynamic contact graphs; a joint diagonalisation approach,2013,"This paper presents a technique for analysis of dynamic contact networks aimed at extracting periods of time during which the network changes behaviour. The technique is based on tracking the eigenvectors of the contact network in time (efficiently) using a technique called Joint Diagonalisation (JD). Repeated application of JD then shows that real-world networks naturally break into several modes of operation which are time dependent and in one real-world case, even periodic. This shows that a view of real-world contact networks as realisations from a single underlying static graph is mistaken. However, the analysis also shows that a small finite set of underlying static graphs can approximate the dynamic contact graphs studied. We also provide the means by which these underlying approximate graphs can be constructed.   Core to the approach is the analysis of spanning trees constructed on the contact network. These trees are the routes a broadcast would take given a random starting location and we find that these propagation paths (in terms of their eigenvector decompositions) cluster into a small subset of modes which surprisingly correspond to clusters in time. The net result is that a dynamic network may be approximated as a (small finite) set of static graphs. Most interestingly the MIT dataset shows a periodic behaviour which allows us to know in advance which mode the network will be in. This has obvious consequences as individuals in the network take differing roles in differing modes. Finally, we demonstrate the technique by constructing a synthetic network with an 4 underlying modes of operation; creating synthetics contacts and then used JD to extract the original underlying modes."
1245367,13990,23653,Bounded rationality can increase parking search efficiency,2014,"The search for parking space in busy urban districts is one of those routine human activities that can benefit from the widespread adoption of pervasive sensing and radio communication technologies. Proposed parking assistance solutions combine sensors, either as fixed infrastructure or onboard vehicles, wireless networking technologies and mobile social applications running over smartphones to collect, share and present to drivers real-time information about parking availability and demand. One question that arises is how does (and should) the driver actually use such information to take parking decisions, e.g., whether to search for on-street parking space or drive to a parking lot and, in the latter case, which one. The paper is, hence, a performance analysis study that seeks to capture the highly behavioral and heuristic dimension of drivers' decisions and its impact on the efficiency of the parking search process. To this end we model drivers as agents of bounded rationality and consider lexicographic heuristics, an instance of the fast and frugal heuristics developed in behavioral sciences such as psychology and biology, as the mechanisms for their decisions.   We analyze the performance of the search process under these heuristics and compare it against the predictions of normative game-theoretic models assuming fully rational strategically acting agents. We derive conditions under which the simpler heuristic decision-making rules outperform the complex norms and show their satisfaction under a broad range of scenarios concerning the fees charged for the parking resources and their distances from drivers' destinations. The practical implications of these results for parking assistance solutions are identified and thoroughly discussed."
1356163,13990,8228,Open information gateway for disaster management,2012,"How to exchange information between parties in a mega-scale disaster management system is one of the fundamental challenges to support timely and efficient disaster response and relief. Specifically, the timeliness, scalability, and availability are three desirable features for information exchange. We call the framework to support information exchange with the three features an open information gateway, OIGY in short. In this paper, we present the challenges of information gateway, and the design of the communication protocols and the fundamental components and algorithms to support the aforementioned features. The efforts of this work will be divided into two major components: one is the distributed Truthful Real-time Information Publishing and Subscribing (TRIPS), and the other one is Heterogeneous And Plug-n-PlaY networks (HAPPY). The two components in OIGY collaborate to provide reliable and timely information publish and subscription service. TRIPS is responsible for logical information exchange management. Compared to modern real-time publish and subscription services, TRIPS is aimed at information responsiveness and distributed content-based filtering in an un-reliable network. To achieve better responsiveness, TRIPS will take advantage of the run-time service composition of SOA framework to select information sources. To enhance the success rate, TRIPS relies the information routing information provided by HAPPY. HAPPY will integrate heterogeneous communication networks including 3G/WiMAX telecommunication network and mesh mobile network into a coherent communication network and discovers the routes with probabilistic bandwidth guarantee."
718520,13990,369,Dynamic Demand Control with Differentiated QoS in User-in-the-Loop Controlled Cellular Networks,2013,"Cellular communications now and beyond 2020 faces a number of challenges. One of the trends is the ever increasing demand for data rate due to smart mobile devices with an estimated traffic growth of almost 100% per annum. Even with new cellular generation cycles every few years the same increase rate cannot be provided on the supply side. Neither anywhere nor anytime. The gap between supply and demand of wireless capacity will shorten and the conventional over-provisioning approach will not be possible anymore, especially during busy hours. The consequences are more frequent congestion situations with broken application traffic. The quality-of-experience will suffer as user expectations are high and steamed-up by advertising. An inadequate tariff system concentrating on flat-rates is also counterproductive for stability and energy-efficiency. In this paper the temporal user-in-the-loop (UIL) control approach is assumed. This user-centric model implements demand shaping by incentives in form of a dynamic usage-based tariff which adjusts based on the level of congestion in the busy hours. This is comparable to the smart grid operation principle. The novelty in this paper is the differentiated treatment for the exemplary service classes voice, video and data, for which new quantitative user response data is utilized. The control approach performance is calculated and results for stationary and dynamic scenarios are presented."
1612573,13990,23653,Taming uncertainties in real-time routing for wireless networked sensing and control,2012,"Real-time routing is a basic element of closed-loop, real-time sensing and control, but it is challenging due to dynamic, uncertain link/path delays. The probabilistic nature of link/path delays makes the basic problem of computing the probabilistic distribution of path delays NP-hard, yet quantifying probabilistic path delays is a basic element of real-time routing and may well have to be executed by resource-constrained devices in a distributed manner; the highly-varying nature of link/path delays makes it necessary to adapt to in-situ delay conditions in real-time routing, but it has been observed that delay-based routing can lead to instability, estimation error, and low data delivery performance in general. To address these challenges, we propose the  Multi-Timescale Estimation (MTE)  method; by accurately estimating the mean and variance of per-packet transmission time and by adapting to fast-varying queueing in an accurate, agile manner, MTE enables accurate, agile, and efficient estimation of probabilistic path delay bounds in a distributed manner. Based on MTE, we propose the  Multi-Timescale Adaptation (MTA)  routing protocol; MTA integrates the stability of an ETX-based directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) with the agility of spatiotemporal data flow control within the DAG to ensure real-time data delivery in the presence of dynamics and uncertainties. We also address the challenges of implementing MTE and MTA in resource-constrained devices such as TelosB motes. We evaluate the performance of MTA using the NetEye and Indriya sensor network testbeds. We find that MTA significantly outperforms existing protocols, e.g., improving deadline success ratio by 89% and reducing transmission cost by a factor of 9.7."
1891462,13990,20338,Proportional rate reduction for TCP,2011,"Packet losses increase latency for Web users. Fast recovery is a key mechanism for TCP to recover from packet losses. In this paper, we explore some of the weaknesses of the standard algorithm described in RFC 3517 and the non-standard algorithms implemented in Linux. We find that these algorithms deviate from their intended behavior in the real world due to the combined effect of short flows, application stalls, burst losses, acknowledgment (ACK) loss and reordering, and stretch ACKs. Linux suffers from excessive congestion window reductions while RFC 3517 transmits large bursts under high losses, both of which harm the rest of the flow and increase Web latency.   Our primary contribution is a new design to control transmission in fast recovery called proportional rate reduction (PRR). PRR recovers from losses quickly, smoothly and accurately by pacing out retransmissions across received ACKs. In addition to PRR, we evaluate the TCP early retransmit (ER) algorithm which lowers the duplicate acknowledgment threshold for short transfers, and show that delaying early retransmissions for a short interval is effective in avoiding spurious retransmissions in the presence of a small degree of reordering. PRR and ER reduce the TCP latency of connections experiencing losses by 3-10% depending on the response size. Based on our instrumentation on Google Web and YouTube servers in U.S. and India, we also present key statistics on the nature of TCP retransmissions."
1124656,13990,208,Application of Low Cost Optical Communication Systems to Underwater Acoustic Networks,2014,"Acoustic communications are the dominant method for underwater information transmission in underwater environments where radio is heavily absorbed underwater. Due to the vast discrepancy in propagation delay between acoustic and optical communication, short range low cost optical systems have the potential to compliment the capabilities of underwater acoustic networks.In this paper we evaluate several applications in which ultralow cost, short range optical transmitter-receiver pairs can be applied to improve the performance and utility of underwater acoustic sensor networks. Applications evaluated include time synchronization between nodes and TCP communication.Next, Broadcast MAC, a prototypical media access control protocol which performs well underwater is simulated in Aquasim. Results of this simulation show that schemes which focus on using optical links to reduce the total amount of data sent over the acoustic network are more worthwhile those which focus on reducing the overhead associated with adding additional nodes.Finally a prototype, low cost IR transmitter/receiver pair is constructed from parts which can be purchased for a few dollars. A parts list, circuit diagram, and details on setting up the linux time synchronization server and establishing a TCP/IP link over the serial connection are included. While a blue-green LED would have provided much greater range underwater ( 100 ft vs 1 ft), the inherent simplicity of this device should help to save a great deal of time in the implementation of other more advanced underwater optical communication systems."
2564041,13990,8839,E-eyes: device-free location-oriented activity identification using fine-grained WiFi signatures,2014,"Activity monitoring in home environments has become increasingly important and has the potential to support a broad array of applications including elder care, well-being management, and latchkey child safety. Traditional approaches involve wearable sensors and specialized hardware installations. This paper presents device-free location-oriented activity identification at home through the use of existing WiFi access points and WiFi devices (e.g., desktops, thermostats, refrigerators, smartTVs, laptops). Our low-cost system takes advantage of the ever more complex web of WiFi links between such devices and the increasingly fine-grained channel state information that can be extracted from such links. It examines channel features and can uniquely identify both in-place activities and walking movements across a home by comparing them against signal profiles. Signal profiles construction can be semi-supervised and the profiles can be adaptively updated to accommodate the movement of the mobile devices and day-to-day signal calibration. Our experimental evaluation in two apartments of different size demonstrates that our approach can achieve over 96% average true positive rate and less than 1% average false positive rate to distinguish a set of in-place and walking activities with only a single WiFi access point. Our prototype also shows that our system can work with wider signal band (802.11ac) with even higher accuracy."

In this paper we claim that there exist cases that call for the exact opposite, i.e, use the cellular network to assist a fixed wired network. In particular, we show that by OnLoading'' traffic from the wired broadband network onto the cellular network we can usefully speedup wired connections, on the downlink or the uplink. We consider the technological challenges pertaining to this idea and implement a prototype 3G OnLoading service that we call 3GOL, that can be deployed by an operator providing both the wired and cellular network services. By strategically OnLoading a fraction of the data transfers to the 3G network, one can significantly enhance the performance of particular applications. In particular we demonstrate non-trivial performance benefits of 3GOL to two widely used applications: video-on-demand and multimedia upload. We also consider the case when the operator that provides wired and cellular services is different, adding the analysis on economic constraints and volume cap on cellular data plans that need to be respected. Simulating 3GOL}over a DSLAM trace we show that 3GOL can reduce video pre-buffering time by at least 20% for 50% of the users while respecting data caps and we design a simple estimator to compute the daily allowance that can be used towards 3GOL while respecting caps. Our prototype is currently being piloted in 30 households in a large European city by a large network provider."
2037531,13990,8228,Estimating an End-User's Received Video Signal at the Transmitter Using Cross-Layer Feedback,2011,"The proliferation of wireless technology, mobile computing, and increasingly sophisticated video codecs have fueled the sharp increase in demand for user-centric applications involving wireless video streaming. Consequently, it is becoming progressively more important to ensure that wirelessly transmitted video signals are delivered with optimal perceptual quality to the end-user. This is in contrast to traditional QoS, which aims to optimize system and packet-level performance, but not necessarily perceptual quality. In order to drive towards this goal, one of the most important evolutions to modern video streaming systems will be the adaptive allocation of both wireless and video coding resources at the transmitter - ideally according to a cost function designed to optimize some measure of the received perceptual video quality. Unfortunately, it is not at all likely that a transmitting station will have access to the video signal received by the end-user, and therefore, this precludes the possibility of using such a perceptually-oriented cost function. Indeed, current resource allocation strategies are based on simplistic packet-statistic-based estimates of the received video quality, and one can easily demonstrate that this results in suboptimal perceptual video quality to the end-user. In this paper, we propose a simple, but powerful technique which allows a transmitting station to obtain an accurate estimate of the video signal seen by the recipient using cross-layer feedback between the wireless MAC and the video encoder, thus enabling the transmitter to use more perceptually oriented resource allocation strategies. We support the proposed technique through both simulation and experiments involving a database of over 420 distorted H.264 AVC compressed video sequences."
891652,13990,8228,Utilizing unused network capacity for battery lifetime extension of LTE devices,2012,"The average operational time of today's smart phones with one filling of the accumulator is one of the most important performance parameters for the customers of new devices. Nevertheless, this value is remaining constant or even decreasing in the last few years due to the continuously increasing complexity. On the other hand, for ensuring the fulfillment of the high user-requirements even under worst case conditions, novel cellular systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) are usually over-dimensioned in terms of the maximum available capacity. In this paper, a novel approach is presented which allows for trading in unused cell capacity for battery lifetime extension of the mobile devices. The basic idea in this context is to increase the robustness of the submitted uplink (UL) signal by decreasing the order of the modulation and coding scheme used. If the provided data rate is kept constant, this comes along with an increasing number of allocated Resource Blocks (RB) and therefore a decreased overall cell capacity. Nevertheless, the more robust signal allows for reducing the uplink transmit power while the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters are still met. The results for exemplary Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic show that for users originally submitting at the maximum available transmit power, the consumed energy of the LTE chip-set can be reduced by up to 27.5 % applying this novel approach."

This is complemented with a super-constant lower bound on our approach to connectivity. An important feature is that the algorithms allow for bi-directional (half-duplex) communication.#R##N##R##N#One implication of this result is an improved bound of Ω(1/log n) on the worst-case capacity of wireless networks, matching the best bound known for the extensively studied average-case.#R##N##R##N#We explore the utility of oblivious power assignments, and show that essentially all such assignments result in a worst case bound of Ω(n) slots for connectivity. This rules out a recent claim of a O(log n) bound using oblivious power.

2128230,13990,10162,Using AI planning and late binding for managing service workflows in intelligent environments,2011,"In this paper, we present an approach to aggregating and using devices that support the everyday life of human users in ambient intelligence environments. These execution environments are complex and changing over time, since the devices of the environments are numerous and heterogeneous, and they may appear or disappear at any time. In order to appropriately adapt the ambient system to a user's needs, we adopt a service-oriented approach; i.e., devices provide services that reflect their capabilities. The orchestration of the devices is actually realized with the help of Artificial Intelligence planning techniques and dynamic service binding. At design time, (i) a planning problem is created that consists of the user's goal to be achieved and the services currently offered by the intelligent environment, (ii) the planning problem is then solved using Hierarchical Task Network and Partial-Order Causal-Link planning techniques, (iii) and from the planning decisions taken to find solution plans, abstract service workflows are automatically generated. At run time, the abstract services are dynamically bound to devices that are actually present in the environment. Adaptation of the workflow instantiation is possible due to the late binding mechanism employed. The paper depicts the architecture of our system. It also describes the modeling and the life cycle of the workflows. We discuss the advantages and the limit of our approach with respect to related work and give specific details about implementation. We present some experimental results that validate our system in a real-world application scenario."
1270599,13990,10192,Radio Resource Allocation in Buildings with Dense Femtocell Deployment,2012,"Small cells are becoming essential to offer a promising solution for dramatic mobile traffic growth in future mobile networks. Especially, massive enterprise femtocells are expected to provide high capacity to fulfill high data demands in buildings in order to offload indoor traffic from outdoor macro cells in that over 80% of mobile data traffic is generated indoors. However, as one of the major challenges, inter-femtocell interference gets worse in 3D in-building scenarios because of the presence of numerous interfering sources and needs to be considered in the early network planning phase. The indoor network planning and optimization tool, iBuildNet®, makes accurate prediction of indoor wireless RF signal propagation possible to guide actual indoor femtocell deployments. In this paper, a semi-static resource allocation scheme based on fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is developed to avoid interference on cell edge users for dense indoor femtocell deployments. The minimum number of subbands used in the scenario is worked out with a node-coloring heuristic algorithm. Extensive simulations in a multi-floor building are performed over iBuildNet® to evaluate the performances of the developed scheme. The simulation results illustrate that the developed scheme outperform the traditional FFR-3 scheme that is popular in macro-cell networks, in terms of cell edge user data rate and average user data rate."
2001063,13990,8839,Searchlight: won't you be my neighbor?,2012,"The rapid deployment of millions of mobile sensors and smartphones has resulted in a demand for opportunistic encounter-based networking to support mobile social networking applications and proximity-based gaming. However, the success of these emerging networks is limited by the lack of effective and energy efficient neighbor discovery protocols. While probabilistic approaches perform well for the average case, they exhibit long tails resulting in high upper bounds on neighbor discovery time. Recent deterministic protocols, which allow nodes to wake up at specific timeslots according to a particular pattern, improve on the worst case bound, but do so by sacrificing average case performance. In response to these limitations, we have designed Searchlight, a highly effective asynchronous discovery protocol that is built on three basic ideas. First, it leverages the constant offset between periodic awake slots to design a simple probing-based approach to ensure discovery. Second, it allows awake slots to cover larger sections of time, which ultimately reduces total awake time drastically. Finally, Searchlight has the option to employ probabilistic techniques with its deterministic approach that can considerably improve its performance in the average case when all nodes have the same duty cycle. We validate Searchlight through analysis and real-world experiments on smartphones that show considerable improvement (up to 50%) in worst-case discovery latency over existing approaches in almost all cases, irrespective of duty cycle symmetry."
1021522,13990,369,Phone-Radar: Infrastructure-Free Device-to-Device Localization,2014,"In some practical scenarios such as tour guiding and children babysitting, one mobile device held by tour guides or parents need to know the distance and direction of another nearby mobile device held by tourist or children. However, to date, most existing pedestrian localization methods rely on a fixed external infrastructure, such as a global positioning system(GPS) or pre-deployed wifi access points to provide Localization service for mobile devices. Such methods are constrained either by limited GPS coverage or by complicated set-up procedures. We observe that, when two devices are moving, the change of their positions leads to the change of distance between them. Given the same movements, different relative locations between devices lead to different distance changes. Besides, the distance between and relative movement of devices can be measured by two phone-embedded sensors respectively. This motivates us to exploit the relative localization method by merely two mobile devices. In this work, we present Phone-Radar, which is an infrastructure-free device-to-device localization system. According to the propagation model of wireless signals, the change of distance between devices are modeled by the change of wireless signal strength between them. The movements of devices are recorded by the inertial sensors using step-counting method. We further study the relationship among the initial relative locations between the two devices, their relative movements and the change of received signal strength measurements. Moreover, we implement the proposed method and measure its performance under real world conditions. The testbed experiments show the efficiency of our proposed method."
2159136,13990,20348,Continuous inference of psychological stress from sensory measurements collected in the natural environment,2011,"Repeated exposures to psychological stress can lead to or worsen diseases of slow accumulation such as heart diseases and cancer. The main challenge in addressing the growing epidemic of stress is a lack of robust methods to measure a person's exposure to stress in the natural environment. Periodic self-reports collect only subjective aspects, often miss stress episodes, and impose significant burden on subjects. Physiological sensors provide objective and continuous measures of stress response, but exhibit wide between-person differences and are easily confounded by daily activities (e.g., speaking, physical movements, coffee intake, etc.). In this paper, we propose, train, and test two models for continuous prediction of stress from physiological measurements captured by unobtrusive, wearable sensors. The first model is a physiological classifier that predicts whether changes in physiology represent stress. Since the effect of stress may persist in the mind longer than its acute effect on physiology, we propose a perceived stress model to predict perception of stress. It uses the output of the physiological classifier to model the accumulation and gradual decay of stress in the mind. To account for wide between-person differences, both models self-calibrate to each subject. Both models were trained using data collected from 21 subjects in a lab study, where they were exposed to cognitive, physical, and social stressors representative of that experienced in the natural environment. Our physiological classifier achieves 90% accuracy and our perceived stress model achieves a median correlation of 0.72 with self-reported rating. We also evaluate the perceived stress model on data collected from 17 participants in a two-day field study, and find that the average rating of stress obtained from our model has a correlation of 0.71 with that obtained from periodic self-reports."
741405,13990,8839,Phaser: enabling phased array signal processing on commodity WiFi access points,2014,"Signal processing on antenna arrays has received much recent attention in the mobile and wireless networking research communities, with array signal processing approaches addressing the problems of human movement detection, indoor mobile device localization, and wireless network security. However, there are two important challenges inherent in the design of these systems that must be overcome if they are to be of practical use on commodity hardware. First, phase differences between the radio oscillators behind each antenna can make readings unusable, and so must be corrected in order for most techniques to yield high-fidelity results. Second, while the number of antennas on commodity access points is usually limited, most array processing increases in fidelity with more antennas. These issues work in synergistic opposition to array processing: without phase offset correction, no phase-difference array processing is possible, and with fewer antennas, automatic correction of these phase offsets becomes even more challenging. We present Phaser, a system that solves these intertwined problems to make phased array signal processing truly practical on the many WiFi access points deployed in the real world. Our experimental results on three- and five-antenna 802.11-based hardware show that 802.11 NICs can be calibrated and synchronized to a 20° median phase error, enabling inexpensive deployment of numerous phase-difference based spectral analysis techniques previously only available on costly, special-purpose hardware."
1820181,13990,369,Performance Analysis of Distributed Antenna System for High Building Wireless Communication,2011,"In wireless systems, coverage and capacity is a major challenge especially in high buildings. The system performance is impaired by co-channel interference due to the need to reuse the limited available spectrum in neighbouring floors. In this environment, distributed antenna systems (DASs) can provide adequate coverage and high speed data services in the presence of multipath fading and co-channel interference by optimally combining the same signal from several antennas. This paper proposes a DAS for uplink transmission in high-rise buildings; where remote antenna units (RAUs) are deployed on each floor so as to reduce the access distance while at the same time exploiting spatial diversity. The RAUs are connected to a central unit (CU) where received signals are processed. To analyse the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system with diversity reception, Nakagami/Rayleigh fading channel is assumed for different building geometries and a propagation channel model for in-building propagation is developed based on multiple floor in-building path loss values retrieved from measurement data. This model accounts for the propagation between different floors and ceilings and includes possible reflections from surrounding buildings. The effects of different numbers of receive antennas per floor and deployment conditions are investigated. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme provides improved BER performance, leading to many more simultaneous users being supported on the same frequency in high buildings when compared with a system with a single antenna per floor."
1118810,13990,8228,Implementation of physical-layer network coding,2012,"This paper presents the first implementation of a two-way relay network based on the principle of physical-layer network coding. To date, only a simplified version of physical-layer network coding (PNC), called analog network coding (ANC), has been successfully implemented. The advantage of ANC is that it is simple to implement; the disadvantage, on the other hand, is that the relay amplifies the noise along with the signal before forwarding the signal. PNC systems in which the relay performs XOR or other denoising PNC mappings of the received signal have the potential for significantly better performance. However, their implementation also poses many challenges. For example, the relay must be able to deal with symbol and carrier-phase asynchronies of the simultaneous signals received from the two end nodes, and the relay must perform channel estimation before decoding. We investigate a PNC implementation in the frequency domain, referred to as FPNC, to tackle these challenges. FPNC is based on OFDM. In FPNC, XOR mapping is performed on the OFDM samples in each subcarrier rather than on the samples in the time domain. We implement FPNC on the universal soft radio peripheral (USRP) platform. Our implementation requires only moderate modifications of the packet preamble design of 802.11a/g OFDM PHY. With the help of the cyclic prefix (CP) in OFDM, symbol asynchrony and the multi-path fading effects can be dealt with simultaneously in a similar fashion. Our experimental results show that symbol-synchronous and symbol-asynchronous FPNC have essentially the same BER performance, for both channel-coded and unchannel-coded FPNC."
1155316,13990,369,"Inter-RAT MRO in 3GPP Rel.11: What Works, and What Does Not",2013,"With deploying LTE (Long-Term Evolution) network operators are faced with managing up to three partly overlaying network deployments of different radio access technologies (RATs), for instance, GSM, UMTS and LTE. A concerted management of all three RATs requires self-organizing networks (SON) functionalities which have become an essential part of LTE. One prominent use case is mobility robustness optimization (MRO) and, recently, inter-RAT MRO has been discussed and specified in 3GPP as part of the Rel.11 SON framework. Hereto, a network deployment scenario was assumed where the existing legacy cellular network (for instance UMTS) provides full coverage, while LTE network deployment is limited to areas with high user penetration. Consequently, 3GPP focused on two inter-RAT failure cases, namely too late handover from LTE to 3G and too early handover from 3G to LTE, where the latter case refers to a handover triggered to LTE while the quality offered there is too poor to maintain the call. All other inter-RAT handover failure cases are not considered in Rel.11. In this paper, we investigate the performance of an inter-RAT MRO algorithm based on the Rel.11 capabilities with the reduced set of key performance indicators (KPIs) being applied to deployment scenario where 3G is not ubiquitous and LTE provides better coverage in some areas. The simulation results show that the algorithm with reduced KPI set performs very well for the considered limited LTE coverage scenario, but show expected deficiencies if deployment scenario changes."
1268006,13990,208,Byzantine Attack Isolation in IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks,2012,"This paper introduces an effective solution against Denial of Service (DoS) implemented by byzantine attack in a fully distributed ad-hoc wireless network employing IEEE 802.11. Byzantine attack is the attack performed by a fully trusted node that's turned rogue and already has passed all the authentication and verification processes. When a trusted node is turned rogue, it can easily perform DoS attack on the media access control (MAC) layer to prevent other nodes from communicating. DoS attack is an easy and effective method to disrupt the communications. The byzantine attacker will alter the implementation of the IEEE 802.11 DCF standards to illegally increase the probability of having a successful packet transmitted into the channel on the expense of the other nodes that follow the protocol standards. The solution presented in this paper depends on three stages. First stage is to identify the attacker using mathematical modeling. The second stage utilizes asymmetric cryptography to allow the good nodes communicate to agree on communicating on another frequency and excluding the byzantine attacker, and finally the third stage where the good nodes change the frequency via controlling their transmitters and receivers. The theoretical throughput will be generated using two dimensional Markov Chain to determine the network capacity. Results obtained by the theoretical computations will be used to constantly monitor the network and identify an attacker if present. A cross layer technique will allow the MAC layer to control the Physical layer to change the frequency of the communication session based on the MAC's decision of identifying an attacker."
1258629,13990,8228,On precoding for constant K-User MIMO Gaussian interference channel with finite constellation inputs,2013,"This paper considers linear precoding for constant channel-coefficient K-User MIMO Gaussian Interference Channel (K-MIMO GIC) where each transmitter-i (Tx-i) requires to send d i  independent complex symbols per channel use that take values from fixed finite constellations with uniform distribution to receiver-i (Rx-i), for i = 1, 2, ..., K. The maximum rate achieved by Tx-i as the signal to noise ratio (SNR) tends to infinity, using any linear precoder, when the interference channel-coefficients are zero is termed as Constellation Constrained Saturation Capacity (CCSC) for Tx-i. In this paper, we derive a high SNR approximation for the rate achieved by Tx-i when interference is treated as noise, which is given by the mutual information between Tx-i and Rx-i, denoted by I[X i ;Y i ] where, X i  denotes the symbols generated at Tx-i before precoding and Y i  denotes the symbols received at the antennas of Rx-i. Based on this high SNR approximation, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on the precoders under which I[X i ;Y i ] tends to CCSC for Tx-i. Interestingly, the precoders that achieve interference alignment (IA) satisfy these necessary and sufficient conditions. However, finding precoders that achieve IA is known to be NP-hard in general whereas, the precoders that satisfy the derived necessary and sufficient conditions are easy to find for any given channel-coefficients. Further, we propose a gradient-ascent based algorithm to optimize the sum-rate achieved by precoding with finite constellation inputs and treating interference as noise. Simulation study for a 3-MIMO GIC with d i  = 1, for all i, equipped with two antennas at each node and QPSK inputs shows an improvement of 1.07 bits/sec/Hz in the ergodic sum-rate using the precoders obtained from the proposed algorithm over the precoders that achieve IA, at SNR = -2 dB."
2005374,13990,22021,Lattice strategies for a multi-pair bi-directional relay network,2011,"We consider a cellular network inspired channel model which consists of the bi-directional exchange of information between a base-station and M terminal nodes with the help of a relay. The base-station has a message for each of M terminals, and conversely, each terminal node has a message for the base-station. A single relay assists the bi-directional communication endeavor. We assume an AWGN channel model with direct links (omitted in previous studies) between the base-station, relay, and half-duplex nodes. In this scenario, we derive achievable rate regions for two temporal protocols - needed in half-duplex networks - which indicate which users transmit when. These achievable rate regions are based on a novel lattice encoding and decoding strategy which outperforms previously derived regions using random-coding based decode-and-forward strategies under certain channel conditions. The terminal nodes employ nested lattice codes, and the relay decodes a series of codeword combinations - one of the main novelties of our scheme - from which it deduce the sum-codewords of the base-station to terminal node i, which it then broadcasts. This scheme differs markedly from previously considered successive-decoding based lattice strategies and provides a more general framework for the joint decoding of lattice codewords in a MAC. Numerical evaluations of our lattice-based inner bounds are shown to improve upon previous random-coding based schemes under certain channel conditions, and are compared to half-duplex cut-set outer bounds. We further demonstrate a constant sum-rate gap result using this lattice-based scheme for symmetric channels for one of the two protocols."
1843733,13990,369,Optimal and Low-Complexity Algorithms for Dynamic Spectrum Access in Centralized Cognitive Radio Networks with Fading Channels,2011,"In this paper, we develop a centralized spectrum sensing and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) scheme for secondary users (SUs) in a Cognitive Radio (CR) network. Assuming that the primary channel occupancy follows a Markovian evolution, the channel sensing problem is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We assume that each SU can sense only one channel at a time by using energy detection, and the sensing outcomes are then reported to a central unit, called the secondary system decision center (SSDC), that determines the channel sensing/accessing policies. We derive both the optimal channel assignment policy for secondary users to sense the primary channels, and the optimal channel access rule. Our proposed optimal sensing and accessing policies alleviate many shortcomings and limitations of existing proposals: (a) ours allows fully utilizing all available primary spectrum white spaces, (b) our model, and thus the proposed solution, exploits the temporal and spatial diversity across different primary channels, and (c) is based on realistic local sensing decisions rather than complete knowledge of primary signalling structure. As an alternative to the high complexity of the optimal channel sensing policy, a suboptimal sensing policy is obtained by using the Hungarian algorithm iteratively, which reduces the complexity of the channel assignment from an exponential to a polynomial order. We also propose a heuristic algorithm that reduces the complexity of the sensing policy further to a linear order. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve a near-optimal performance with a significant reduction in computational time."
1223860,13990,369,Proximity-Based Data Offloading via Network Assisted Device-to-Device Communications,2013,"Analysts predict explosive growth in traffic demand on mobile broadband systems over the coming years due to the popularity of streaming video, gaming, and other social media services. While 4G wireless technologies are making a significant effort to keep up with this demand, the expectation is that cellular deployments will fall short of the required capacity unless there is a dramatic shift towards smaller cells. There is already significant interest in femto- and pico-cell deployments for this reason. However, there is another method of creating small cells that the wireless industry has yet to capitalize on, namely direct connectivity between clients in close proximity. 3GPP is currently working to enable device-to-device (D2D) communications within Release 12 of LTE-Advanced. By comparison, IEEE has already defined a D2D communications protocol, termed WiFi Direct, which is based on the 802.11 standards. WiFi Direct not only serves to offload user data onto direct links, but does so using the unlicensed bands. To benefit users further, WiFi Direct can be enhanced by enabling the LTE network to assist during peer discovery and direct connection establishment. In this paper, we discuss the network/client requirements and performance benefits of network-assisted WiFi Direct. We assume that clients are continuously under management by the LTE network, which assists them with service/peer discovery and direct connection establishment. We show that network-assisted WiFi Direct can significantly improve the performance of proximal applications and reduce the power consumed by the clients involved, while also improving capacity of the LTE network."
1042582,13990,10228,Q-CE: Self-organized Cognitive Engine based on Q-learning,2014,"One of the main challenges in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) is that the dynamic radio environment affects the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of Secondary Users (SUs). Another challenge is how to predict Primary Users (PUs) activities over licensed channels, to avoid interfering with PUs. So, there is a need to implement a Cognitive Engine (CE) as a self-organized entity in a CR that overcomes those challenges. In our previous studies, an algorithm called Adaptive Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (ADPSO) combined with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has been proposed for CE. ADPSO selects the optimal configurations when an unknown environment is countered while CBR allows usage of previous knowledge in an environment that has been previously observed. CBR however depends on a single observation of the previous state and gives inaccurate results where an individual states' performance changes. Another problem is how to find the best action when the environment is changing dynamically. In this paper, we propose a self-organized Q-Learning-based CE (Q-CE) which: 1) autonomously adapts the link configuration; 2) applies the previous action under similar environments and 3) where the environment changes, Q-CE learns from radio environment behavior and PU activities the best action to apply, in order to achieve QoS requirements and avoid interfering with PUs. The proposed CE combines following methods: ADPSO for link configuration; CBR for fast reasoning under similar environment; and Q-Learning to learn the environmental behavior. The results show improvements of about 67% in the achieved throughput, about 50% in signaling overhead when compared with the previous solutions that use only ADPSO and CBR."
746227,13990,9015,Tracking unmodified smartphones using wi-fi monitors,2012,"Smartphones with Wi-Fi enabled periodically transmit Wi-Fi messages, even when not associated to a network. In one 12-hour trial on a busy road (average daily traffic count 37,000 according to the state DOT), 7,000 unique devices were detected by a single road-side monitoring station, or about 1 device for every 5 vehicles.   In this paper, we describe a system for passively tracking unmodified smartphones, based on such Wi-Fi detections. This system uses only common, off-the-shelf access point hardware to both collect and deliver detections. Thus, in addition to high detection rates, it potentially offers very low equipment and installation cost.   However, the long range and sparse nature of our opportunistically collected Wi-Fi transmissions presents a significant localization challenge. We propose a trajectory estimation method based on Viterbi's algorithm which takes second-by-second detections of a moving device as input, and produces the most likely spatio-temporal path taken. In addition, we present several methods that prompt passing devices to send additional messages, increasing detection rates an use signal-strength for improved accuracy.   Based on our experimental evaluation from one 9-month deployment and several single-day deployments, passive Wi-Fi tracking detects a large fraction of passing smartphones, and produces high-accuracy trajectory estimates."
1494149,13990,23653,Probabilistic missing-tag detection and energy-time tradeoff in large-scale RFID systems,2012,"RFID (radio frequency identification) technologies are poised to revolutionize retail, warehouse and supply chain management. One of their interesting applications is to automatically detect missing tags (and the associated objects) in a large storage space. In order to timely catch any missing event such as theft, the detection operation may have to be performed frequently. Because RFID systems typically work under low-rate channels, past research has focused on reducing execution time of a detection protocol, in order to prevent excessively-long protocol execution from interfering normal inventory operations. However, when active tags are used to provide a large spatial coverage, energy efficiency becomes critical in prolonging the lifetime of these battery-powered tags. Existing literature lacks thorough study on how to conserve energy in the process of missing-tag detection and how to jointly optimize energy efficiency and time efficiency. This paper makes two important contributions: First, we propose a novel protocol design that takes both energy efficiency and time efficiency into consideration. It achieves multi-fold reduction in both energy cost and execution time when comparing with the best existing work. In some cases, the reduction is more than an order of magnitude. Second, we reveal a fundamental energy-time tradeoff in missing-tag detection. Through our analytical framework, we are able to flexibly control the tradeoff through a couple of system parameters in order to achieve desirable performance."
742746,13990,369,Association and Deployment Considerations in Dense Wireless LANs,2014,"Wireless LANs based on the IEEE 802.11 standard are one of the most commonplace indoor wireless access solutions. As the ever growing demand for data consumption necessitates higher rates and volumes, it is fairly common to observe more and more WLANs being deployed in close proximity to each other. As distances between WLAN installations diminish, the access points (APs) and stations (STAs) in these WLANs create a complex interference environment, which is also compounded by the indoor propagation environment. In this paper, we investigate the impact of two important parameters related to the deployment and operation of densely deployed wireless LANs on the aggregate throughput obtained by all the nodes in these WLANs. The first such operational parameter we investigate is access point and user station association; namely, whether STAs associate with a random strong AP or the AP from which they obtain the strongest received power. The second operational parameter we consider is the way in which APs are placed in the indoor environment; namely, whether APs are deployed randomly or in a manner to reduce inter-AP interference. In order to account for the complex node interactions in the MAC layer, which is crucial for accurate performance estimation, we perform packet-level simulations using OPNET. Our results show that the type of node association used in densely deployed WLANs has a critical impact on the aggregate throughput. In comparison, the type of AP deployment used is not nearly as significant; varying from moderate to no impact at all."
1456438,13990,10228,Performance analysis of indoor OFDM optical wireless communication systems,2012,"In this paper, the performance of indoor OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) optical wireless (OW) communication systems in the presence of LED (light emitting diode) clipping distortions is analyzed. Two indoor OW OFDM techniques are considered. An ACO-OFDM (asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM) system produces half-wave symmetry time signal at the output of the OFDM modulator by special assignment of subcarriers. Therefore, bipolar-unipolar conversion is achieved by clipping the signal at the zero level at the expense of data rate reduction. The second technique, called DCO-OFDM (DC-biased optical OFDM), assigns data to all possible subcarriers to increase the data rate. However, half-wave symmetry signals cannot be achieved and a DC bias is needed to convert the bipolar signal to a unipolar signal before modulating the LED intensity. The performance of these systems, in terms of average electrical OFDM signal power versus bit-error-ratio (BER), DC power consumption, and transmitted optical power in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and considering a practical LED model, are studied. Analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulation results and the results demonstrate close match. The results clearly highlight that LED clipping has significant impact on the performance of these systems and system design should consider optimizing the OFDM signal power, DC bias point, and LED dynamic range."
1118880,13990,8228,Low-carbon routing algorithms for cloud computing services in IP-over-WDM networks,2012,"Energy consumption in telecommunication networks keeps growing rapidly, mainly due to emergence of new Cloud Computing (CC) services that need to be supported by large data centers that consume a huge amount of energy and, in turn, cause the emission of enormous quantity of CO 2 . Given the decreasing availability of fossil fuels and the raising concern about global warming, research is now focusing on novel “low-carbon” telecom solutions. E.g., based on today telecom technologies, data centers can be located near renewable energy plants and data can then be effectively transferred to these locations via reconfigurable optical networks, based on the principle that data can be moved more efficiently than electricity. This paper focuses on how to dynamically route on-demand optical circuits that are established to transfer energy-intensive data processing towards data centers powered with renewable energy. Our main contribution consists in devising two routing algorithms for connections supporting CC services, aimed at minimizing the CO 2  emissions of data centers by following the current availability of renewable energy (Sun and Wind). The trade-off with energy consumption for the transport equipments is also considered. The results show that relevant reductions, up to about 30% in CO 2  emissions can be achieved using our approaches compared to baseline shortest-path-based routing strategies, paying off only a marginal increase in terms of network blocking probability."
1355497,13990,8228,"Wi-Fi, but not on Steroids: Performance analysis of a Wi-Fi-like Network operating in TVWS under realistic conditions",2012,"The recent decisions by regulators in the USA and UK to open up unused portions of UHF spectrum for secondary use have been met with keen interest in using these TV white spaces (TVWS) for providing broadband services through Wi-Fi-like connectivity. Amid the ensuing media hype about “Wi-Fi on steroids”, there is a widespread perception that Wi-Fi operating in TVWS will provide much longer range, superior speeds, and more reliable connections than traditional Wi-Fi at 2.4 GHz. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis of the performance of a network of Wi-Fi-like access points (APs) operating in TVWS in order to obtain a realistic estimate of the achievable range and downlink rate of such a secondary system. Unlike previous studies, we explicitly consider the effects of inter-AP interference and congestion and use real TVWS channel availability estimates from an example region of Germany. We confirm the favourable properties of the lower TVWS frequency range, of enabling better propagation through walls and a larger coverage range for the same power budget. Our results show that operating Wi-Fi hotspots in TVWS might be technologically attractive for outdoor rural areas where user demand is low. However, the extended coverage range in TVWS leads to increased congestion which rapidly limits the system capacity for an outdoor urban deployment with high user density. Therefore, a combined technological and economical analysis is essential before any final judgement can be reached about the viability of large-scale Wi-Fi deployments in TVWS."
2421695,13990,10162,Tracking vehicular speed variations by warping mobile phone signal strengths,2011,"In this paper, we consider the problem of tracking fine-grained speeds variations of vehicles using signal strength traces from GSM enabled phones. Existing speed estimation techniques using mobile phone signals can provide longer-term speed averages but cannot track short-term speed variations. Understanding short-term speed variations, however, is important in a variety of traffic engineering applications—for example, it may help distinguish slow speeds due to traffic lights from traffic congestion when collecting real time traffic information. Using mobile phones in such applications is particularly attractive because it can be readily obtained from a large number of vehicles. Our approach is founded on the observation that the large-scale path loss and shadow fading components of signal strength readings (signal profile) obtained from the mobile phone on any given road segment appear similar over multiple trips along the same road segment except for distortions along the time axis due to speed variations. We therefore propose a speed tracking technique that uses a Derivative Dynamic Time Warping (DDTW) algorithm to realign a given signal profile with a known training profile from the same road. The speed tracking technique then translates the warping path (i.e., the degree of stretching and compressing needed for alignment) into an estimated speed trace. Using 6.4 hours of GSM signal strength traces collected from a vehicle, we show that our algorithm can estimate vehicular speed with a median error of ± 5mph compared to using a GPS and can capture significant speed variations on road segments with a precision of 68% and a recall of 84%."
922329,13990,8228,Using spatial correlation of ocean current for velocity estimate of underwater drifting nodes,2013,"The ability to navigate underwater is a key requirement for most underwater applications. Mobile devices, drifters, and also human divers, all require precise navigation capability to perform long term missions while being submerged. In the absence of GPS reception, performing underwater navigation (UN) requires an accurate state-space-model (SSM) to allow the tracked node (TN) to self-estimate its location. However, irregularities in nodes motion (mostly due to unpredictable changes of ocean current) makes it hard to reliably determine the SSM. In this paper, we rely on spatial correlation of ocean current, and propose to estimate the drift velocity of the TN as a combination of the drift velocities of anchors, and to directly use it as part of the SSM. This not only augments the amount of information available for the TN to track its own position, but also offers an unbiased velocity estimate which increases the reliability of the SSM. Since ocean current may not be always correlated (for example, in the case of turbulence), we offer two unbiased confidence indexes: one which is based on the range to the anchor, and a second which is based on the homogeneity of the current velocity field. To evaluate the potential of utilizing node spatial dependencies for UN, we collect trajectories of drifting nodes from both model-based simulations and a sea trial performed in Israel. Our results suggest that nodes drifting motion shows strong spatial correlation which could greatly enhance the performance of tracking algorithms."
2284762,13990,8228,Let me grab your App: Preliminary proof-of-concept design of opportunistic content augmentation,2012,"With the rate of mobile traffic growth eventually outpacing 4G technology upgrades, it appears crucial to explore new means to offload cellular networks. Exploitation of device-to-device opportunistic short range connectivity for offloading purposes is an intriguing and widely investigated direction, but might ultimately play a negligible practical role: in front of the huge overall content universe a user may select to access, it is indeed unlikely that a specific user request is found in a possibly small number of neighboring mobile devices. Focusing on a concrete use-case scenario, namely Apps download from Google's Android market, we discuss a preliminary design and implementation of CarpeDroid, a local coordination approach devised to proactively augment the network response to a user lookup (in our use-case, coming from the App Market server) with download opportunities for content locally stored in neighboring devices and likely to fall within the users' interest. Our approach aims at acting as a simple recommending system, locally operated on the end user device, and not requiring any interaction with centralized servers. Efficiency and “better than nothing” privacy protection is achieved through the exchange of Bloom filters devised to summarize content opportunistically available in neighboring devices."
1747328,13990,9475,Scheduling in time-correlated wireless networks with imperfect CSI and stringent constraint,2014,"In a wireless network, the efficiency of scheduling algorithms over time-varying channels depends heavily on the accuracy of the Channel State Information (CSI), which is usually quite “costly” in terms of consuming network resources. Scheduling in such systems is also subject to stringent constraints such as power and bandwidth, which limit the maximum number of simultaneous transmissions. In the meanwhile, communication channels in wireless systems typically fluctuate in a time-correlated manner. We hence design schedulers to exploit the temporal-correlation inherent in channels with memory and Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) feedback from the users for better channel state knowledge, under the assumption of Markovian channels and the stringent constraint on the maximum number of simultaneously active users. We model this problem under the framework of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. In recent work, a low-complexity optimal solution was developed for this problem under a long-term time-average resource constraint. However, in real systems with instantaneous resource constraints, how to optimally exploit the temporal correlation and satisfy realistic stringent constraint on the instantaneous service remains elusive. In this work, we incorporate a stringent constraint on the simultaneously scheduled users and propose a low-complexity scheduling algorithm that dynamically implements user scheduling and dummy packet broadcasting. We show that the throughput region of the optimal policy under the long-term average resource constraint can be asymptotically achieved in the stringent constrained scenario by the proposed algorithm, in the many users limiting regime."
1142152,13990,8228,"Joint beamforming, scheduling, and power allocation for hierarchical cellular systems",2012,"The idea of cognitive radio (CR) has embodied concretely in hierarchical cellular systems by deploying an underlying microcellular system to reuse the underutilized spectrum licensed by an macrocellular system. The fundamental challenges for successfully realizing such hierarchical systems are to manage the intercell interference between the macrocell and microcell and to pursue the goal of maximizing the spectrum recycling efficiency. In this paper, we jointly consider antenna beamforming, power allocation, and multiuser scheduling for the microcellular system to opportunistically utilize the uplink spectrum of the macrocell and to concurrently serve multiple secondary users in the downlink. With the objective of maximizing the sum rate, the three-dimensional joint design problem is often formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) which is an NP-hard problem and very complicated to solve. We resort to semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques to convert to the cumbersome optimization problem into a convex problem by introducing an interference-related auxiliary variable. An iterative algorithm based on semidefinite programming is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. The zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and the singular value decomposition (SVD)-based beamforming with the best scheduling are simulated for performance comparisons, and our simulation shows that the proposed scheme is much superior to the ZF scheme and quite close to the SVD scheme with a slight performance gap of 1 bps/Hz."

Collecting data from these objects is an important task as it allows software systems to understand the environment better. Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones). In this paper, we propose Mobile Sensor Data Processing Engine (MOSDEN), an plug-in-based IoT middleware for mobile devices, that allows to collect and process sensor data without programming efforts. Our architecture also supports sensing as a service model. We present the results of the evaluations that demonstrate its suitability towards real world deployments. Our proposed middleware is built on Android platform."
1848273,13990,8228,HySAC: A Hybrid Delivery System with Adaptive Content Management for IPTV Networks,2011,"The emergence of new platforms providing Internet protocol television (IPTV) services, such as Google TV [1] and Apple TV [2] is expected to revolutionize the way multimedia services are provided on the Internet. However, the existing network infrastructure falls well short of meeting the resource requirements to provide satisfactory levels of such services. This has led the service providers like Google to contemplate deploying large farms of network cables to transport the traffic generated by their IPTV services. However, the huge cost involved in achieving their target, means careful resource planning and meeting users' expectations are essential. In this paper, we propose an effective adaptive HYbrid delivery System Adaptive Content management (HySAC), which dynamically selects the mode of video delivery from unicast, multicast and peer-to-peer (P2P) based on the popularity of the respective videos. The videos are dynamically classified into high, medium and low popularity groups and, they are delivered using multicast, P2P and unicast methods respectively. HySAC reduces the start-up delay as the mode of delivery is well defined and the resource availability to support the delivery is guaranteed. We have evaluated the performance of HySAC on a realistic simulated environment and presented experimental results; they indicate that HySAC performs significantly better than pure unicast, multicast and P2P mechanisms. This paper also provides a mechanism to classify the videos into different popularity classes."

This infrastructure hosts many components, numerous technologies, and various devices and computers. The infrastructures and their supported systems are dynamically evolving and can be characterized as ecosystems. On the other hand, attackers over the global Internet exploit weaknesses in one component to attack other parts of the system, taking advantage of lack of global security view. The trend will only increase in the future as more computers are embedded in the infrastructure and more demanding applications are to be developed, and as bigger parts of the global economy move to cyberspace.#R##N##R##N#Given the state of the art and future developments, it seems mandatory to develop a holistic yet practical approach to protect the computing infrastructure, and to embed it in the ecosystem development process. This infrastructure will be a collection of inter related ecosystems, with providers at the center of each ecosystem. In addition, the ecosystemhas to be dynamically evolving. The position stated here is that approaches and methodologies for security will need to change and evolve as well.

1378479,13990,9015,NEAT: a novel energy analysis toolkit for free-roaming smartphones,2014,"Analyzing the power consumption of smartphones is difficult because of the complex interplay between soft- and hardware. Currently, researchers rely on mainly two options:  external measurement tools , which are precise but constrain the mobility of the device and require the annotation of power traces; or  modelling methods , which allow mobility and consider explicitly the state of events, but have less accuracy and lower sampling rates than external tools.   We address the challenges of mobile power analysis with a novel power metering toolkit, called  NEAT , which comprises a coin-sized power measurement board that fits inside a typical smartphone, and analysis software that automatically fuses the event logs taken from the phone with the obtained power trace. The combination of high-fidelity power measurements and detailed information about the state of the phone's hardware and software components allows for fine-grained analysis of complex and short-lived energy patterns.   We equipped smartphones with  NEAT  and conducted various experiments to highlight (i) its accuracy with respect to model-based approaches, showing errors upwards of 20%; (ii) its ability to gather accurate and well annotated user-data in the wild, which would be hard to do with current external meters; and (iii) the importance of having fine-granular and expressive traces by resolving kernel energy bugs."
1535690,13990,8228,General total inter-carrier interference cancellation for OFDM high speed aerial vehicle communication,2013,"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been considered as a strong candidate for next generation high speed aerial vehicle communication systems. However, OFDM systems suffers severe performance degradation due to inter-carrier interference (ICI) in high mobility channel, if no ICI cancellation is performed. Traditionally, training symbols have been employed in one packet to help the OFDM receiver to estimate the multi-path channel and the carrier frequency offset (CFO) between the transmitter local oscillator and the receiver local oscillator. However, in aerial vehicle communication, the relative transmitter-receiver speed changes so rapidly that it is unreasonable to assume a constant speed (and CFO) during the entire packet transmission. Hence, to accurately estimate the CFO, training symbols need to be transmitted for every OFDM symbol. Obviously, this significantly reduces OFDM throughput while adding complexity due to repeated CFO estimation. In this paper, we extend our previous work to propose a joint channel/CFO estimation and ICI cancellation algorithm. Specifically, in our previous work, we have proposed a total ICI cancellation algorithm using parallel processing for OFDM system which offers the excellent ICI cancellation and BER performance. However, in this work, perfect channel information was assumed. In this paper, we combine the channel estimation with the ICI cancellation together. The proposed general total ICI cancellation algorithm has the ability to jointly estimate the carrier frequency offset and channel information, and improve the performance significantly. Meanwhile, a serial processing is proposed to reduce the computation complexity. Simulation results in different scenarios confirm the performance of the proposed scheme in multipath fading channels for high speed aerial vehicle communication."
711132,13990,10228,Using simple harmonic motion to estimate walking distance for waist-mounted PDR,2012,"A huge body of work utilized signal strength of short range signal (such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ultra sound or Infrared) to build a radio map for indoor localization, by deploying a great number of beacon nodes in the building. The drawback of such an infrastructure-based approach is that the deployment and calibration of the system is costly and labor-intensive. To overcome that, some prior studies proposed the use of Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) for indoor localization. The PDR system does not require to build a beacon-based infrastructure, in which a small number of sensors are put on the pedestrian. These sensors (such as G-sensor and Gyro) are used to estimate the distance and direction that the user traveled. The PDR approach can be generally categorized into two types: foot-mounted and waist-mounted. In general, the foot-mounted system can get accurate step length, but perform poorly in estimated heading direction. On the other hand, the waist-mounted system can estimate direction with high accuracy, but is hard to measure the step length. In this work, we proposed a waist-mounted based PDR using one 3-axis accelerometer and one gyroscope sensor. We utilize vertical acceleration to implement double integral for measuring the user's instant height change and use some physical features of vertical acceleration during the walking to calibrate the measurement. Then based on the Pythagoras' Theorem, we can estimate each step length based on the user's height change during his/her walking. Our experiment results show that the accuracy is about 98.26% in estimating the user's walking distance."
2375797,13990,22021,An improvement to the Haroutunian bound for anytime coding systems,2011,"In the study of error exponents, the Haroutunian exponent is encountered as an upper bound for several point-to-point communication problems over DMCs including block coding with feedback and fixed-delay coding. For symmetric channels, such as the BSC or BEC, the Haroutunian exponent is equal to the sphere-packing exponent. But for asymmetric channels, such as the Z-channel, the Haroutunian bound is strictly larger than the sphere-packing exponent. It is generally believed that the sphere-packing bound should hold for these problems, even though they are different from the problem of block coding without feedback. The fundamental difficulty in these problems is that the distribution of the input is not known during the error event, and unlike symmetric channels, there is no ‘universally good’ input distribution like the uniform distribution. The result is that a worst-case assumption is made on the input distribution to give the Haroutunian bound, even though the resulting input distribution is useless for communication purposes. In order to make progress on this issue, we study an extended notion of fixed-delay codes called anytime codes, a class of codes that indirectly enforce the property that nontrivial communication is attempted during the error event. For this class of codes, we give a new upper bound to the error exponent that strictly improves on the Haroutunian bound for asymmetric channels. While the new exponent still does not reach sphere-packing, we show that the ratio of the two exponents approaches 1 as the rate approaches capacity for Z-channels. This fact may have an interesting consequence for the viewpoint of maximum achievable rate for a given delay and desired error probability. Additionally, the improved exponent yields a tighter bound for a notion of sufficiency of a channel for control purposes."

A fundamental problem in such a system is to determine how to map each SVI to a physical data center network such that operational costs are minimized subject to the constraints that each VM's resource requirements are met and bandwidth demands between VMs can be guaranteed before and after failures. This problem can be naturally divided into two sub-problems: VM Placement(VMP) and Virtual Link Mapping (VLM). We present a general optimization framework for this mapping problem. Then we present an efficient algorithm for the VMP sub problem as well as a polynomial-time algorithm that optimally solves the VLM sub problem, which can be used as subroutines in the framework. We also present an effective heuristic algorithm that jointly solves the two sub problems. It has been shown by extensive simulation results based on the real VM data traces collected from the green data center at Syracuse University that compared with the First Fit Descending (FFD) and single shortest path based baseline algorithm, both our VMP+VLM algorithm and joint algorithm significantly reduce the reserved bandwidth, and yield comparable results in terms of the number of active servers."
862851,13990,8228,An energy efficiency power and sub-carrier allocation for the downlink multi-user CoMP in multi-cell systems,2012,"Coordinated multi-point transmission/reception (CoMP) has been proposed as an effective technology to improve cell-edge throughput in next-generation wireless systems. However, all the BSs(Base Station) need to share all the users' messages to do the global precoding for supporting each user best service, such as which BS will be chosen for cooperating or how to realize the cooperation, lots of energy will be consumed when doing this process. In addition, in most of the existing works, BSs always allocate equal power to all the users neglecting user's Channel State Informations(CSIs) or their service requirements, this may also cause enery wasting. In this paper, we focus on the throughput maximizing problem while fully considering energy saving problem in the CoMP systems. At first, we propose the concept of “cell zooming” which we define that one of the cooperating BSs will “sleep” if it improves little to user's service, then a sub-carrier allocation algorithm with varying power assignment in downlink CoMP system is put forward, this can lower the transmit power of BS. We formulate that the sub-carrier and power allocation problem is a mixed binary integer programming (MBIP) problem, a “green” subcarrier and power allocation algorithm which can maximize the cell's throughput is proposed at last, the power allocated to each user will be calculated. Simulation results show that the proposed sub-carrier and power allocation algorithm is much better on users' throughput and fairness while consumes less energy than the existing ones."
1368826,13990,8228,EDR 2 : A sink failure resilient approach for WSNs,2012,"Data collection, redistribution and retrieval are essential components of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In dense WSN deployments, the sensor data are usually sent to a sink that can be reached through one or multiple hops. In the case where communications with the sink are disrupted due to various reasons, the data must be stored in the network for later retrieval. When considering in-network storage, we must redistribute the data among an energy-constrained network with sensors that have a low storage capacity. In previous works, the data redistribution problem has been studied, but the focus was only on the redistribution costs while the data retrieval costs (which have been analyzed in other works as an independent problem) were ignored. We recognize that these two problems should be studied in concert and therefore, in this paper, we combine both data redistribution and retrieval into a single problem. We propose a graph transformation, formulate the problem as a minimum cost flow optimization problem and use linear programming to find the optimal solution. Moreover, we introduce an algorithm named EDR 2 : energy-efficient data redistribution and retrieval. EDR 2  is a distributed energy-efficient algorithm for in-network storage and later retrieval in WSNs. To evaluate our solution on a large scale, we modeled different scenarios in a 400-node network, used the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) to obtain the optimal solutions, and ran simulations to find the solutions using our algorithm. Finally, we implemented EDR 2  using real sensors to demonstrate the feasibility of our algorithm. We compared EDR 2  with two heuristic algorithm and show that our approach is an energy-efficient solution for node selection when redistributing data in a WSN for eventual retrieval."
1276276,13990,23712,Gaming over COPSS: A content centric communication infrastructure for gaming applications,2011,"Supporting Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG) is a significant challenge. MMORPGs have become very popular because of their attractive structuring and incorporation of realistic and creative scenarios. World of Warcraft and Counter-Strike are examples of such games and are characterized by high interactivity (need very low network latency). Every action an individual player performs typically needs to be communicated to all the related players and the players need to react according to the ‘current’ environment and the cumulative actions of all the players. Games like Second Life involve a large number of players and require a persistent view of the world that is usually managed by a dedicated server (e.g., one that is hosted by the game's publisher). The load on such a server for player management and communication can be significant, and is likely to be a source of substantial latency. A problem in designing a MMORPG is that of determining the related players for every action and disseminate these actions and the changed environment to the relevant players in a scalable manner with very low latency. For games where the environment is divided into regions that different groups of players may have varying amounts of visibility, it is desirable to sub-divide the environment into hierarchical regions. We envisage incorporating the notion of a “multi-layer hierarchical map”. While such capabilities exist in some limited form in selected games, such as Second Life (where players share a global map), they may be useful in a wide range of interactive MMORPG. A server-based infrastructure is likely to have more difficulty with providing this capability because of the communication and processing (customized for each individual player) requirements."
1543353,13990,23653,An analytical framework to characterize the efficiency and delay in a mobile data offloading system,2014,"Smart mobile devices are generating a tremendous amount of data traffic that is putting stress on even the most advanced cellular networks. Delayed offloading has recently been proposed as an efficient mechanism to substantially alleviate this stress. The idea is simple. It allows a mobile device to delay transmission of data packets for a certain amount of time, while it searches WiFi (or similarly femtocell) networks to offload the data during the time. When the time expires, it completes the remaining portion of the delayed transmission through the cellular network that is available at the moment. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework using an embedded Markov process for the delayed offloading system. We provide a closed-form expression for estimating how much data generated by the users can be offloaded to WiFi networks from cellular networks even when there are non-Markovian data arrivals and service interruptions. We conduct extensive numerical studies with various ranges of delay, service interruption time, arrived data, and service rate. These numerical studies show that the current deployment of WiFi networks measured from a metropolitan city is capable of offloading about 80% of the generated data with 30 minutes of delay and 1 Mbps of WiFi data rate, but increasing the data rate does not help improve the amount of offloading. Further studies using this framework on two new deployment strategies of WiFi networks give guidance on how to upgrade WiFi networks by revealing that the amount of offloading for 30 minutes of delay and 1 Mbps of data rate can be drastically improved to about 90% or 98% according to the strategy."
1665832,13990,9589,Bringing Mobility-Awareness to WLANs using PHY Layer Information,2014,"With the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, mobile devices are soon becoming a preferred medium of Internet access in Wireless LANs (WLANs). Due to their smaller form factor, these truly mobile devices allow the users to access the wireless networks while undergoing different types of mobility, posing new challenges to wireless protocols. Current history-based protocols that maximize performance in static settings do not work well in mobile settings where wireless conditions change rapidly. Thus, today's WLANs need to be able to determine the type of the client's mobility and employ appropriate strategies in order to sustain high performance. While previous work tried to detect mobility using hints from sensors available in today's mobile devices, in this work, we demonstrate how different mobility modes can be distinguished by using physical layer information -- Channel State Information (CSI) and Time-of-Flight (ToF) -- available at commodity APs, with no modifications on the client side. In addition, we demonstrate how fine-grained mobility determination can be exploited to improve performance of client roaming, rate control, frame aggregation, and MIMO beamforming. Our testbed experiments show that our mobility classification algorithm achieves more than 92% accuracy in a variety of scenarios, and the combined throughput gain of all four mobility-aware protocols over their mobility-oblivious counterparts can be more than 100%."
2245022,13990,8228,Opportunistic Virtual Backbone Construction in Intermittently Connected Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,2011,"Data communication over intermittently connected mobile ad hoc networks (ICMANs) can be carried out by opportunistically employment of mobility nature of nodes and the storage space of all nodes. In order to overcome mobility randomness and subsequently uncertainty of future network state, multi-copy-based routing approaches are widely considered. However, scalability is still an issue, even extra routing information such as mobility statistics and context is employed to control the number of message copies. This is because communicating overhead to exchange all such information still exponentially increases as network size increases. Therefore, this paper introduces an opportunistic virtual backbone (VBB) constructing algorithm to form a hierarchical architecture over ICMANs. Once VBB is formed, all routing information and multiple message copies are limited among the VBB members, and thereby routing overhead can be reduced dramatically. Different from the conventional unit disk graph (UDG) based solutions for MANETs, the proposed algorithm utilizes a weighted graph derived from mobility statistics to model underlying long-term stable topology of ICMANs. To reduce constructing overhead, only partial two-hop mobility statistics are collected by each node. Moreover, intermittent connectivity and delayed message transmission are also addressed in the paper. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly scalable as network size increases and the existing SCF routing protocols can work well over ICMANs where VBBs are formed."
1174293,13990,369,An Extensible Distributed Measurement Platform for Analyzing Quality-of-Experience (QoE) of Multimedia Applications over Wireless Networks,2012,"With rapid advancement of 3G wireless network technology, mobile Internet access is becoming more and more popular in recent years, and web access by mobile phones even surpassed that by other means. Users' level of satisfaction of services based on such rapidly developing technology immediately becomes an important issue. The distributed QoS (Quality of Service) / QoE (Quality of Experience) measurement platform proposed here solves this problem by offering network engineers capability to monitor network service quality and the likely QoE as experienced by phone users while watching streaming videos, for purposes like benchmarking and tracking down problematic cells. There are three major components of the proposed system: (1) client program; (2) backend server; and (3) web interface. The client program runs on Android smartphones. Using the various equipped hardware sensors, radio information, location information and network statistics, etc., are collected. By exploiting the mobility of smartphones, data can be collected wherever the phone is located. Those data are uploaded to the backend server for data aggregation and processing. In particular, a QoE computation algorithm recommended by ITU is used to convert raw data into QoE scores. To facilitate easy access to the general network service quality, a versatile web interface is also implemented to give detailed information of individual data collection sessions."
1631581,13990,10228,Analytical characterization of computationally efficient localization techniques,2013,"Trilateration-based localization techniques have been widely used in sensor networks due to their computational efficiency and distributedness. However in sparse networks or in the boundary area of networks, trilateration-based techniques often fail to localize all localizable nodes. Bilateration-based techniques emerge as a generalization of trilateration techniques to a broader class of networks. Compared with trilaterationbased techniques, the main benefit of bilateration-based schemes is that they can localize a higher percentage of nodes while still maintaining the low computational complexity and distributedness properties. One potential drawback of bilaterationbased schemes is that the number of estimated possible positions (hence the memory required to store these positions) may grow exponentially with the number of nodes in the network. Despite the empirical observations reported in the literature that such exponential growth is a rare event, there is a lack of rigorous analysis quantifying the complexity of bilaterationbased schemes. In this paper, we tackle the challenge by first characterizing a broad subclass of the set of critical sub-networks within which the number of possible estimated positions grows exponentially with the size of these sub-networks. Then using mathematical techniques from percolation theory, we prove that, in random geometric networks, with very high probability the size of these critical sub-networks, which constitute the worst case for bilateration-based localization, is bounded. Therefore the complexity of bilateration-based localization technique does not grow exponentially with the size of the entire network. The significance of this result is to analytically demonstrate that bilateration-based techniques not only localize a higher fraction of nodes than their trilateration counterpart, but also they can be implemented in a very efficient (low computational cost) manner."
1827425,13990,10192,On QoS Provisioning in Context-Aware Wireless Sensor Networks for Healthcare,2011,"Wireless body sensors combined with ubiquitous Wireless Sensor Networks enable pervasive healthcare applications. This technology can significantly improve the quality of life of chronically ill and elderly. Remote medical monitoring applications consist of many features as continuous medical monitoring, emergency alerts, location tracking and home automation. These heterogeneous systems have to implement Quality of Service mechanisms to ensure that the different functions have their QoS requirements satisfied, that the most important traffic still has its QoS requirements fulfilled in case of network overload and finally that QoS mechanisms are able to adapt dynamically depending on the context. From our knowledge, QoS provisioning in wireless sensor networks for healthcare has never been studied from the context-awareness specific perspective, although context-awareness is the core issue of WSN for healthcare and that these networks have specific characteristics in comparison with most WSN. Health monitoring applications demand high reliability as life of human beings is involved, therefore Quality of Service support in such systems is vital. As patient may evolve from a non-critical health status to a critical one, context-awareness is essential to adapt the network performance to the new situation. In this paper we study the specific QoS requirements of healthcare applications. Then, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of related work regarding these characteristics and context-awareness. Finally, we point out remaining challenges and open research issues."
1501478,13990,23836,Using Physical Stigmergy in Decentralized Optimization under Multiple Non-separable Constraints: Formal Methods and an Intelligent Lighting Example,2014,"In this paper, a distributed asynchronous algorithm for intelligent lighting is presented that minimizes collective power use while meeting multiple user lighting constraints simultaneously and requires very little communication among agents participating in the distributed computation. Consequently, the approach is arbitrarily scalable, adapts to exogenous disturbances, and is robust to failures of individual agents. This algorithm is an example of a decentralized primal-space algorithm for constrained non-linear optimization that achieves coordination between agents using stigmergic memory cues present in the physical system as opposed to explicit communication and synchronization. Not only does this work make of stigmergy, a property first used to describe decentralized decision making in eusocial insects, but details of the algorithm are inspired by classic social foraging theory and more recent results in eusocial-insect macronutrient regulation. This theoretical analysis in this paper guarantees that the decentralized stigmergically coupled system converges to within a finite neighborhood of the optimal resource allocation. These results are validated using a hardware implementation of the algorithm in a small-scale intelligent lighting scenario. There are other real-time distributed resource allocation applications that are amenable to these methods, like distributed power generation, in general, this paper means to provide proof of concept that physical variables in cyberphysical systems can be leveraged to reduce the communication burden of algorithms."
1775554,13990,23735,Situation awareness via sensor-equipped eyeglasses,2013,"New smartphone technologies are emerging which combine head-mounted displays (HMD) with standard functions such as receiving phone calls, emails, and helping with navigation. This opens new opportunities to explore cyber robotics algorithms (robotics sensors and human motor plant). To make these devices more adaptive to the environmental conditions, user behavior, and user preferences, it is important to allow the sensor-equipped devices to efficiently adapt and respond to user activities (e.g., disable incoming phone calls in an elevator, activate video recording while car driving). This paper hence presents a situation awareness system (SAS) for head-mounted smartphones. After collecting data from inertial sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes), and video data (camera), SAS performs activity classification in three steps. Step 1 transforms inertial sensor data into a head orientation-independent and stable normalized coordinate system. Step 2 extracts critical features (statistical, physical, GIST). Step 3 classifies activities (Naive Bayes classifier), distinguishes between environments (Support Vector Machine), and finally combines both results (Hidden Markov Model) for further improvement. SAS has been implemented on a sensor-equipped eyeglasses prototype and achieved high accuracy (81.5%) when distinguishing between 20 real-world activities."
1016283,13990,8228,Q-FCRA: QoS-based OFDMA femtocell resource allocation algorithm,2012,"Recently, operators have resorted to femtocell networks in order to enhance indoor coverage and increase system capacity. Nevertheless, to successfully deploy such solution, efficient resource allocation algorithms and interference mitigation techniques should be deployed. The new applications delivered by operators require large amounts of network bandwidth. Whereas, some customers may want to pay more in exchange for a better quality of service (QoS), some others need less resources and can be charged accordingly. Hence, we consider an OFDMA femtocell network serving both QoS constrained high-priority (HP) and best-effort (BE) users. Our objective is to satisfy a maximum number of HP users while serving BE users as well as possible. This optimization problem is multi-objective NP-hard. For this aim, we propose in this paper a new resource allocation and admission control algorithm, called Q-FCRA, based on clustering and taking into account QoS requirements. We show by extensive network simulation results that our proposal outperforms two state of the art schemes (Centralized-Dynamic Frequency Planning, C-DFP, and Distributed Random Access, DRA) as well as our previous proposal, FCRA, in both low and high density networks. The results concern the number of accepted users, the fairness, the throughput satisfaction rate and the spectrum spatial reuse."
1530646,13990,8228,Enhancing QoS/QoE in multimedia networks,2013,"In a multimedia context, QoS (Quality of Service) is a measure of success. It represents the guarantee of successfully delivering packets, without delaying or dropping any, therefore, the guarantee of providing high quality experience for end-users. Depending on the content being delivered, there exist various parameters which need to be considered when designing QoS architectures, such as latency, jitter, bandwidth and packet loss. There is a direct and high impact of such parameters on voice quality, video streaming, data traffic etc. On the other hand, high-performance networks are required to support different traffic types, alternating from continuous data streams for real-time communication to burst traffic for best-effort communication. The traffic on high-performance networks can be divided into four categories: Constant Bit Rate, Variable Bit Rate, Available Bit Rate and Unspecified Bit Rate, according to the service requirements of source applications and to the arrival characteristics. The aim of the research work presented in this paper is to identify the most appropriate QoS-related techniques to be applied in order to provide qualitative services and to ensure the efficiency of resource consumption, under the constraints imposed by each traffic type. The research results are based on performance measurements conducted within our Competence Center for Network Management, taking into consideration various traffic types, queuing mechanisms and resource reservation protocols."
1585961,13990,369,Energy-Efficient Routing in Ad Hoc Networks Relying on Channel State Information and Limited MAC Retransmissions,2011,"In ad hoc networks the nodes actively and voluntarily participate in constructing a network and act as relays for other nodes. As a result of node-mobility, the Channel State Information (CSI) varies and hence a substantial amount of control messages have to be exchanged across the network to maintain reliable communications between certain pairs of nodes, which potentially imposes a high energy-consumption. Therefore, minimizing the energy consumption and maximizing the throughput of ad hoc nodes is extremely important. This paper analyzes both the energy consumption and the achievable throughput of a multihop route by exploiting both the CSI quantified, for example in terms of the Frame Error Ratio (FER), as well as the number of Medium Access Control (MAC) retransmissions and the number of hops. Since using limited number of MAC retransmissions in a hop-by-hop retransmission mode imposes dependencies amongst the links of a multi-hop route, a more accurate objective function may be formulated than that which assumes the availability of an infinite number of retransmissions and which considers the links to be independent. Our simulations confirm the improved accuracy of the proposed Objective Function (OF), especially when the FER and the number of hops are high and the number of MAC retransmissions is low. Additionally, a low-complexity routing algorithm is designed, which carries out routing decisions based on the energy consumption predicted by the OF, and strikes a compromise between having 'few long-distance hops' and 'many short-distance hops' for the sake of energy minimization and throughput maximization."
1651709,13990,8228,MOMCC: Market-oriented architecture for Mobile Cloud Computing based on Service Oriented Architecture,2012,"The vision of augmenting computing capabilities of mobile devices, especially smartphones with least cost is likely transforming to reality leveraging cloud computing. Cloud exploitation by mobile devices breeds a new research domain called Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). However, issues like portability and interoperability should be addressed for mobile augmentation which is a non-trivial task using component-based approaches. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a promising design philosophy embraced by mobile computing and cloud computing communities to stimulate portable, complex application using prefabricated building blocks called Services. Utilizing distant cloud resources to host and run Services is hampered by long WAN latency. Exploiting mobile devices in vicinity alleviates long WAN latency, while creates new set of issues like Service publishing and discovery as well as clientserver security, reliability, and Service availability. In this paper, we propose a market-oriented architecture based on SOA to stimulate publishing, discovering, and hosting Services on nearby mobiles, which reduces long WAN latency and creates a business opportunity that encourages mobile owners to embrace Service hosting. Group of mobile phones simulate a nearby cloud computing platform. We create new role of Service host by enabling unskilled mobile owners/users to host Services developed by skilled developers. Evidently, Service availability, reliability, and Service-oriented mobile application portability will increase towards green ubiquitous computing in our mobile cloud infrastructure."
746983,13990,369,Joint Energy-Efficient Single Relay Selection and Power Allocation for Analog Network Coding with Three Transmission Phases,2014,"The multiple access broadcast (MABC) is an effective two phases transmission (2P) ANC protocol for the half-duplex (HD) communication mode. However, MABC does not make use of channel gain of the direct link (DL) no matter how strong it is. On the other hand, the time division broadcast (TDBC) is known as a three phases transmission (3P) protocol which enables transceivers to utilize DL and thus offers the possibility to achieve higher performance compared with the MABC at the expense of a reduced spectral efficiency due to the one extra transmission phase. In this paper, we investigate a joint single relay selection and power allocation schemes for energy-efficient wireless communication systems with analog network coding (ANC) for TDBC, where two-way relay channel with two end nodes and N parallel relay nodes is considered under an assumption of perfect channel-state information (CSI). Our objective is to minimize the total system transmit power consumption under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for TDBC protocol with joint single relay selection and nodes power allocation. In addition, a zero-forcing based relay signal combining technique that combines the signals received at the 1st and 2nd transmission phases, also known as zero-forcing relay power allocation (ZF-RPA), is also investigated. Numerical simulation shows that the traditional VG-RPA is more energy-efficient than the ZF-RPA scheme for TDBC in cases with and without utilizing DL."
1311774,13990,8228,Time domain synchronous OFDM based on simultaneous multi-channel reconstruction,2013,"Time domain synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM) can achieve a higher spectrum efficiency than standard cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM). Currently, it can support constellations up to 64QAM, but cannot support higher-order constellations like 256QAM due to the residual mutual interferences between the pseudorandom noise (PN) guard interval and the OFDM data block. To solve this problem, we break the traditional approach of iterative interference cancellation and propose the idea of using multiple inter-block-interference (IBI)-free regions of very small size to realize simultaneous multi-channel reconstruction under the framework of structured compressive sensing, whereby the sparsity nature of wireless channels as well as the characteristic that path delays vary much slower than path gains are jointly exploited. In this way, the mutually conditional time-domain channel estimation and frequency-domain data demodulation in TDS-OFDM can be decoupled without the use of IBI removal. We then propose the adaptive simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (A-SOMP) algorithm with low complexity to realize accurate multi-channel reconstruction, whose performance is close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme can support 256QAM without changing the current signal structure, so the spectrum efficiency can be increased by about 30%."
1086525,13990,8228,Power consumption optimization for information exchange in wireless-relay sensor networks,2012,"Minimization of power consumption is a critical design goal for wireless-relay networks comprised of battery-powered sensor devices. Traditionally, wireless communication is optimized to minimize the total transmission power. In the paper, we further include the detection power and the reception power in order to minimize the overall network power consumption for information exchange in wireless-relay sensor networks (WSNs). Specifically, after the physical attributes of relay nodes are given, we wish to maximize the network lifetime by a proper selection of the transmission range, the sleep period, and the participation density. We propose a random gossip network (RGN) as a framework for our analysis. We find simple rules govern the optimal settings of these three parameters for all-to-all broadcast in the RGN. One key relationship is that the optimal number of nodes broadcasting messages in a time epoch within the transmission range depends only on the path loss exponent and the network dimensionality. This optimal value does not depend on factors such as the physical network size, the reception cost, and the message origination rate. Moreover, it is shown that neither increasing nor decreasing the physical network size will affect the optimal value of these design parameters. The optimal setting for power consumption minimization is a scalable solution. Finally, we demonstrate that our results can be well applied to predict the optimal value of operational parameters for information exchange as well as information dissemination in actual WSNs."
1428055,13990,208,Fusion of Radio and Camera Sensor Data for Accurate Indoor Positioning,2014,"Indoor positioning systems have received a lot of attention recently due to their importance for many location-based services, e.g. indoor navigation and smart buildings. Lightweight solutions based on WiFi and inertial sensing have gained popularity, but are not fit for demanding applications, such as expert museum guides and industrial settings, which typically require sub-meter location information. In this paper, we propose a novel positioning system, RAVEL (Radio And Vision Enhanced Localization), which fuses anonymous visual detections captured by widely available camera infrastructure, with radio readings (e.g. WiFi radio data). Although visual trackers can provide excellent positioning accuracy, they are plagued by issues such as occlusions and people entering/exiting the scene, preventing their use as a robust tracking solution. By incorporating radio measurements, visually ambiguous or missing data can be resolved through multi-hypothesis tracking. We evaluate our system in a complex museum environment with dim lighting and multiple people moving around in a space cluttered with exhibit stands. Our experiments show that although the WiFi measurements are not by themselves sufficiently accurate, when they are fused with camera data, they become a catalyst for pulling together ambiguous, fragmented, and anonymous visual tracklets into accurate and continuous paths, yielding typical errors below 1 meter."
422067,13990,21066,Throughput regions and optimal policies in wireless networks with opportunistic routing,2013,"Opportunistic routing in wireless networks has been proposed as a method to combat the volatility of wireless links, by leveraging their broadcast nature and choosing the next hop for each transmitted packet post-facto, using the actual reception outcomes at the respective neighbors, rather than based on a priori information. Much of the research on the topic has focused on protocol design issues, e.g. coordination mechanisms among the next-hop candidates; however, the fundamental performance bounds of the scheme are not yet known. In this paper we study the theoretical throughput region of opportunistic routing, for a generic network model with an arbitrary matrix of packet erasure probabilities between any two nodes, which cannot be mapped onto any classical model due to the existence of undirected broadcast from each node. We introduce a generic technique involving a transformation into a virtual network consisting of nodes corresponding to packet states in the original network, and define two different throughput-optimal scheduling policies in the virtual network, one based on a backpressure-like approach, and another that uses a dynamic programming algorithm which finds the minimum time to clear the system from any initial queued backlog. These policies can support both a unidirectional (half-duplex) flow between a given source and destination, and a bidirectional (full-duplex) connection with inter-session network coding in intermediate nodes."
2151552,13990,10228,A flexible MAC development framework for cognitive radio systems,2011,"Cognitive radios are becoming the technological foundation for efficiently managing the scarcity of wireless spectrum, fulfilling various QoS demands and allowing different networks to coexist. Cognition and spectrum agility in MAC protocols require adaptability and close PHY-MAC interaction. Classically, MAC protocols have been implemented in hardware, which gives a limited possibility for reconfiguration and customization. Recently, software based MAC implementations have emerged although a close hardware-software co-design is typically required to keep the time critical operations in ASICs or FPGAs. We introduce a MAC development framework for enabling fast composition of MAC protocols, which are best fitted to the application requirements, communication capabilities of the radio, and current spectrum regulations and policies. We decompose MAC protocols into their basic functionalities which are perceived as building blocks and are partitioned across hardware/software. Our framework allows on-the-fly realization of the envisioned MAC protocol through wiring of these fundamental components. By exposing extended metadata and hardware functionalities for the MAC implementation through our granular components, together with the support for run-time re-configuration, spectrum agile and cognitive MAC solutions can be easily realized. In this paper, we describe the design rationale and implementation details of our framework on WARP [1] boards. We show through experimental evaluation that the framework provides flexible means for prototyping different reconfigurable cognitive and spectrum agile MAC protocols."
302661,13990,20348,PhotoNet: A similarity-aware image delivery service for situation awareness,2011,"This demonstration illustrates PhotoNet, an image delivery service for mobile camera networks. PhotoNet is motivated by the needs of disaster-response applications, where a group of survivors and first responders may survey damage and send images to a rescue center in the absence of a functional communication infrastructure. The protocol runs on mobile devices, handling opportunistic forwarding (when they come in contact) and in-network storage. It assigns priorities to images for forwarding and replacement depending on the degree of similarity (or dissimilarity) among them. Prioritization aims at reducing semantic redundancy such as that between pictures of the same scene taken from slightly different angles. This is in contrast to redundancy among identical objects and among time series data. We evaluate PhotoNet in an emulated disaster recovery scenario, with a predetermined set of problem locales that need attention. Humans with camera phones form a mobible camera sensor network. Not all pictures make it to the rescue center because of resource constraints. At the rescue center, the utility of the camera network is measured by the number of problem locales of which the center becomes aware as a function of time. A better network delivers awareness of more trouble locales sooner. We show that, in resource constrained networks, reducing semantic redundancy can significantly improve utility. Users of the demo will be allowed to interact with both a simulator and a small set of mobile phones to understand the impact of network and protocol parameters on situation awareness."
678439,13990,8228,Optimal dedicated protection approach to shared risk link group failures using network coding,2012,"Survivable routing serves as a key role in connection-oriented communication networks for achieving desired service availability for each connection. This is particularly critical for the success of all-optical mesh networks where each lightpath carries a huge amount of data. Currently, 1+1 dedicated path protection appears to be the most widely deployed network resilience mechanism because it offers instantaneous recovery from network failures. However, 1+1 protection consumes almost twice as much capacity as required, which imposes a stringent constraint on network resource utilization. In addition, finding an SRLG-disjoint path is essential for 1+1 protection, which is nonetheless subject to non-trivial computation complexity and may fail in some SRLG scenarios. To address these problems, we introduce a novel framework of 1+1 protection, called Generalized Dedicated Protection (GDP), for achieving instantaneous recovery from any SRLG failure event. It is demonstrated, that finding a non-bifurcated optimal solution for GDP is NP-complete. Thus, the paper presents a novel scheme applying Generalized Dedicated Protection and Network Coding (GDP-NC) to ensure both optimal resource utilization among dedicated protection approaches and instantaneous recovery for single unicast flows, which can be split into multiple parts in all-optical networks. We demonstrate that the proposed GDP-NC survivable routing problem is polynomial-time solvable, owing to the ability to bifurcate flows. This flexibility comes at the expense of additional hardware for linear combination operations for the optical flows."

The forwarding table, implemented at the data plane fast path of Internet routers to drive the packet forwarding process, currently contains about half a million entries and counting. Meanwhile, it needs to support millions of complex queries and updates per second. In this paper, we make the curious observation that the entropy of IP forwarding tables is very small and, what is more, seems to increase at a lower pace than the size of the network. This suggests that a sophisticated compression scheme may effectively and persistently reduce the memory footprint of IP forwarding tables, shielding operators from scalability matters at least temporarily. Our main contribution is such a compression scheme which, for the first time, admits both the required information-theoretical size bounds and attains fast lookups, thanks to aggressive level compression. Although we find the underlying optimization problem NP-complete, we can still give a lightweight heuristic algorithm with firm approximation guarantees. This allows us to squeeze real IP forwarding tables, comprising almost 500, 000 prefixes, to just about 140 -- 200 KBytes of memory within a factor of 2 -- 3 of the entropy bound, so that forwarding decisions take only 8 -- 10 memory accesses on average and updates are supported efficiently. Our compression scheme may be of more general interest, as it is applicable to essentially any prefix tree."
1307947,13990,23653,Efficient health data compression on mobile devices,2013,"There is an increase rise in the usage of mobile health sensors in wearable devices and smartphones. These embedded systems have tight limits on storage, computation power, network connectivity and battery usage making it important to ensure efficient storage/ communication of sensor readings to centralized node/ server. Frequency Transform or Entropy encoding schemes such as arithmetic or Huffman coding can be used for compression, but they incur high computational cost in some scenarios or are oblivious to the higher level redundancies in signal. To this end, we used the property of periodicity in these naturally occurring signals such as heart rate or gait measurements to design a simple low cost scheme for data compression. First, a modified Chi-square periodogram metric is used to adaptively determine the exact time-varying periodicity of the signal. Next, the time-series signal is folded into Frames of length equal to a pre-determined period value. We have successfully tested the scheme for good compression performance in ECG, motion accelerometer data and Parkinson patients samples, leading to 8-14X compression in large sample sizes (6-8K samples) and 2-3X in small sample sizes (200 samples). The proposed scheme can be used stand-alone or as pre-processing step for existing techniques in literature."
373655,13990,9913,An integrated approach for future mobile network architecture,2014,"In this position paper, we identify the potential of an integrated deployment solution for energy efficient cellular networks combining the strengths of two very active research themes: software defined radio access networks (SD-RAN) [1] and decoupled signaling and data transmissions, or beyond cellular green generation (BCG 2 ) architecture, for enhanced energy efficiency [2]. While SD-RAN envisions a decoupled centralized control plane and data forwarding plane for flexible control, the BCG 2  architecture calls for decoupling coverage from capacity and coverage is provided through always-on low-power signaling node for a larger geographical area; capacity is catered by various on-demand data nodes for maximum energy efficiency. In this paper, we identify that a combined approach bringing in both specifications together can, not only achieve greater benefits, but also facilitates the faster realization of both technologies. We propose the idea and design of a signaling controller which acts as a signaling node to provide always-on coverage, consuming low power, and at the same time also hosts the control plane functions for the SD-RAN through a general purpose processing platform. Phantom cell concept is also a similar idea where a normal macro cell provides interference control to densely deployed small cells [3], although, our initial results show that the integrated architecture has much greater potential of energy savings in comparison to phantom cells."

WSNs can gather information about the environment automatically and unattended and are suitable for many applications.The typical characteristic of WSNs is that they are energy and bandwidth constrained. Hence, routing protocols and algorithms for WSN must aim to conserve these two scarce resources. WSNs are also highly application-specific. This mean, firstly, that there is a tight bound between the application layer and the different protocol layers. Secondly, there are some WSN target applications that require certain protocol functionality that is not mandatory for other WSNs. In other words, both the general challenges and the specific application challenges must be addressed.This thesis aims to address routing in WSNs both from a general and an application specific perspective. Among the general energy-and bandwidth related topics the work in this thesis focuses on aggregation and routing-efficiency. Among the application-related topics the work focuses on localization and interoperability.The main contributions are:• A method for letting the routing protocol contribute in node localization.• A method for increasing the energy and bandwidth utilization with passive clustering.• A method for increasing the energy and bandwidth utilization using multiple sinks.• A data-aggregation scheme for WSNs that interoperates with external networks via a standardized interface.• A hybrid routing mechanism that are able to operate in high-interference scenarios.• Lessons learned from a real-world test campaign of a surveillance WSN."
1545367,13990,8228,Network-coded caching-aided multicast for efficient content delivery,2013,"Consider a content delivery network in which storage and transport resources, characterized by their capacity and cost (e.g., energy) efficiency, are used to meet users' content object requests. The goal is to find the evolution of the objects being stored and transported by the network resources that meets user requests, satisfies network resource capacities and minimizes overall network cost. We first present a constructive offline solution that provides the maximum network efficiency (or minimum cost per object delivered) that can be achieved by dynamically exploiting network-coded caching and multicasting under arbitrary time-varying demands. We refer to the solution scheme as a dynamic network-coded caching-aided multicast (NCCAM) scheme, and illustrate it in a 6-node butterfly network. We then consider a single time period in which each user requests an arbitrary subset of content objects. We formulate the problem as a network coding problem on a caching-augmented graph and show that under uniform demand, random linear coded caching and multicasting is sufficient for achieving minimum cost caching-aided multicast. For the arbitrary demand scenario, we provide the transport-storage-popularity tradeoff of a polynomial-time solution that uses uncoded caching according to object popularity and random linear coded transmission. We show that while for skewed Zipf object popularity such a simple scheme achieves close to optimal performance, as the Zipf parameter approaches zero (uniform popularity), significant cost reductions can be obtained by optimizing the transport configuration at the expense of increased computational complexity."
1625067,13990,9015,Accurate real-time relative localization using single-frequency GPS,2014,"For outdoor navigation, GPS provides the most widely-used means of node localization; however, the level of accuracy provided by low-cost receivers is typically insufficient for use in high-precision applications. Additionally, many of these applications do not require precise  absolute  Earth coordinates, but rather rely on  relative  positioning to infer information about the geometric configuration of the constituent nodes in a system. This paper presents a novel approach that uses GPS to derive relative location information for a scalable network of single-frequency receivers. Networked nodes share their raw satellite observations, enabling each node to localize its neighbors in a pairwise fashion as opposed to computing its own standalone position. Random and systematic errors are mitigated in novel ways, challenging long-standing beliefs that precision GPS systems require extensive stationary calibration times or complex equipment configurations. In addition to presenting the mathematical basis for our technique, a working prototype is developed, enabling experimental evaluation of several real-world test scenarios. The results of these experiments indicate sub-meter relative positioning accuracy under various conditions and in varying environments. This represents up to order of magnitude increase in precision over existing absolute positioning techniques or other unimodal GPS-based solutions."
2049157,13990,8228,FELL: A Flexible Virtual Network Embedding Algorithm with Guaranteed Load Balancing,2011,"Network virtualization has emerged as the most promising approach to overcome the current ossification of the Internet. A key problem in it is how to efficiently and effectively make use of the substrate network resources by embedding multiple virtual networks with various constraints. Due to its NP-hardness, many heuristic approaches have been proposed. However, most of them simplify the problem by relaxing some constraints, resulting in their designs in conflict with practical limitations. Furthermore, some other important design issues, like load balancing and the response time requirements of different applications, have been usually ignored as well. In this paper, we propose FELL, a Flexible virtual network Embedding algorithm with guaranteed Load baLancing for the general problem. Based on simulated annealing, FELL can flexibly control the tradeoff between results accuracy and running time to meet various requirements of different applications by changing parameters. Load balancing enables substrate network to avoid resource fragmentation and further increases the profit of infrastructure providers. A novel cost criterion that reflects the impact of distribution of allocated resources for an embedding is designed to conduct embedding process to guarantee it. The splittable flow is supported to obtain better resource utilization by making use of small pieces of available bandwidth. We also design some key functions including generating initial and neighbor solutions. The effectiveness of our algorithm is finally validated by our simulations."
682599,13990,369,Markov-History Based Modeling for Realistic Mobility of Vehicles in VANETs,2013,"Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) can be considered as complex dynamic systems where simulation modeling plays a crucial role in conducting research due to the difficulties in the realization of such a network, like high costs, risks and dangers. During the last decade, the results of VANET simulations were considered successful and acceptable however, most prior VANET simulators were based on non realistic mobility when describing node positions, distribution, frequency and movement, model paths, traffic signals etc. To deal with this challenge, we propose in this paper a Markov-History based modeling for realistic mobility of vehicles in VANETs. It starts with a geographic area digitization, followed by a vehicle positions initialization. The proposed model predicts directions of the vehicles using a Markov chain, as well as it predicts the vehicle velocities using a History-based sub-model. Moreover, the density of the network is updated according to the peak or off-peak hours. The emerged model can be used as mobility model to simulate VANET scenarios. To validate our proposal, a concrete mobility model has been designed using the proposed model that represents the downtown of Biskra City located in Algeria. The performances of the resulting network have been proved against the others obtained using Random Waypoint as a standard mobility model in terms of packet delivery ratio, network overhead, average end-to-end delay, and dropped packets."
1850288,13990,8228,Error Exponents for Multi-Source Multi-Relay Parallel Relay Networks with Limited Backhaul Capacity,2011,"In this paper, we assess the random coding error exponents (EEs) corresponding to decode-and-forward (DF), compress-and-forward (CF) and quantize-and-forward (QF) relaying strategies for a parallel relay network (PRN), consisting of two sources, two relay stations (RSs) and single destination where the RSs access to the destination via orthogonal, error-free, limited-capacity backhaul links. Among these relaying strategies, the DF and QF studied in this paper differ from their well-known conventional versions in certain aspects. In the DF relaying, each RS applies maximum-likelihood (ML) detection and sends the message corresponding to the detected signal along with a reliability information to the destination which finalize the decision on the transmitted message. In QF relaying, as opposed to the Gaussian codebook and vector quantization (VQ) theoretical model used for deriving bounds, we consider a simple and practical relaying strategy consisting of finite-alphabet constellations (i.e., M-QAM) at the sources and symbol-by-symbol uniform scalar quantizers (uSQs) at the RSs. We also show, through numerical analysis, that the proposed QF relaying can provide better EEs than the others when the modulation constellation sizes selected by the sources match to the network conditions, i.e., operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the backhaul capacity is sufficient. This behavior is due to the structure inherent in the considered modulation alphabets, which Gaussian signaling lacks."
2309808,13990,8228,"Asymptotically-Optimal, Fast-Decodable, Full-Diversity STBCs",2011,"For a family/sequence of Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) $\mathcal{C}_1,\mathcal{C}_2,\dots$, with increasing number of transmit antennas $N_i$, with rates $R_i$ complex symbols per channel use (cspcu), $i=1,2,\dots$, the \emph{asymptotic normalized rate} is defined as $\lim_{i \to \infty}{\frac{R_i}{N_i}}.$ A family of STBCs is said to be \emph{asymptotically-good} if the asymptotic normalized rate is non-zero, i.e., when the rate scales as a non-zero fraction of the number of transmit antennas, and the family of STBCs is said to be \emph{asymptotically-optimal} if the asymptotic normalized rate is $1$, which is the maximum possible value. In this paper, we construct a new class of full-diversity STBCs that have the least maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding complexity among all known codes for any number of transmit antennas $N>1$ and rates $R>1$ cspcu. For a large set of $\left(R,N\right)$ pairs, the new codes have lower ML decoding complexity than the codes already available in the literature. Among the new codes, the class of full-rate codes ($R=N$) are asymptotically-optimal and fast-decodable, and for $N>5$ have lower ML decoding complexity than all other families of asymptotically-optimal, fast-decodable, full-diversity STBCs available in the literature. The construction of the new STBCs is facilitated by the following further contributions of this paper: (i) Construction of a new class of asymptotically-good, full-diversity multigroup ML decodable codes, that not only includes STBCs for a larger set of antennas, but also either matches in rate or contains as a proper subset all other high-rate or asymptotically-good, delay-optimal, multigroup ML decodable codes available in the literature. (ii) Construction of a new class of fast-group-decodable codes (codes that combine the low ML decoding complexity properties of multigroup ML decodable codes and fast-decodable codes) for all even number of transmit antennas and rates $1 < R \leq 5/4.$ (iii) Given a design with full-rank linear dispersion matrices, we show that a full-diversity STBC can be constructed from this design by encoding the real symbols independently using only regular PAM constellations."
825807,13990,369,Enhancing In-Home 802.11 Performance: Mesh or MIMO?,2013,"This paper analyses the throughput and coverage of an in-home wireless LAN in the 5GHz band. A novel approach is proposed based on part measurement, part simulation. The spatial and temporal characteristics of typical in-home channels are modelled using 3D ray tracing and combined with measured and appropriately orientated complex polarmetric patterns for each antenna element. Physical layer throughput is computed across 10 rooms in a virtual test house for all modulation and coding schemes. To accelerate the simulation process a received bit information rate abstraction technique is applied. Results are given for a standard 802.11a deployment. The benefits of 3x3 MIMO are then compared against the deployment of a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). In the latter case meshing is performed using low cost single antenna radios. Relative to the benchmark SISO system, 3x3 MIMO is shown to improve the average throughput by 123%. Given four randomly deployed mesh points, the mesh solution improves the average throughput by 31%. Importantly, for the test house under consideration the MIMO solution improves connectivity by just 3%, while the mesh network offers 100% (whole home) connectivity. The mesh network (using 4 additional mesh points) is shown to support high definition video for 90% of the links, compared to 71% with 3x3 MIMO. Results confirm that mesh networks benefit the weaker links, while MIMO boosts the stronger links."
2096067,13990,22260,Efficient Online WiFi Delivery of Layered-Coding Media Using Inter-layer Network Coding,2011,"A primary challenge in multi casting video in a wireless LAN to multiple clients is to deal with the client diversity -- clients may have different channel characteristics and hence receive different numbers of transmissions from the AP. A promising approach to overcome this problem is to combine multi-resolution (layered) video coding with interlayer network coding. The fundamental challenge in such an approach is to determine the strategy of coding the packets across different layers that maximizes the number of decoded layers at all clients. This paper makes three contributions. (1) We first show that even for one client, the previously proposed canonical triangular scheme for inter-layer network coding can perform poorly. We show how to enhance the triangular scheme by incorporating the estimated target number of layers which significantly improves its effectiveness. (2) We show that such an enhanced triangular scheme still performs poorly for multiple clients with diverse channel characteristics, which motivates the need for searching for the optimal coding strategy. The naive way of searching for the optimal strategy is computationally prohibitive. We present several optimizations that drastically reduce the complexity of exhaustively searching for the optimal strategy, making it feasible in real time. (3) Finally, we design and evaluate an on line video delivery scheme, Percy, to be deployed at a proxy behind the AP of a wireless LAN. Our simulation results show that Percy outperforms the previous inter-layer coding heuristic by up to 22-80% with varying numbers of clients."
2101586,13990,23836,Oversubscription Bounded Multicast Scheduling in Fat-Tree Data Center Networks,2013,"Multicast benefits numerous data center applications that require group communication by eliminating sending unnecessary duplicated packets in the network, thus significantly reduces network traffic and improves application throughput. Meanwhile, many data center networks (DCNs) adopt a multi-rooted tree structure called fat-tree, which utilizes rich path multiplicity to deliver high bisection bandwidth. However, currently there is no efficient flow scheduling algorithm for the fat-tree that can route multicast flows appropriately to achieve traffic load balance, thus cannot fully take advantage of this high degree of link parallelism. Besides low bandwidth utilization, unbalanced traffic load distribution also leads to unpredictable network performance and degraded data center agility. In this paper, we study multicast traffic load balance problem in fat-tree DCNs. First, we derive a minimum link oversubscription upper bound in multicast fat-tree DCNs based on a network model that accurately describes the DCN communication environment. Then, we present Oversubscription Bounded Multicast Scheduling (OBMS), a low-complexity multicast flow scheduling algorithm that guarantees bounded link oversubscription and efficient network utilization even under the most congested traffic patterns. Finally, we evaluate the performance of OBMS in an event-driven DCN simulator under various types of traffic patterns, and show that OBMS significantly outperforms other load-balance methods in terms of network throughput and evenness of traffic load distribution."
1186318,13990,10192,A Mediation Layer for Connecting Data-Intensive Applications to Reconfigurable Data Nodes,2013,"A novel and rapidly growing area of research concerns data-intensive applications and the technical challenges that accompany it. One of those challenges is developing approaches and mechanisms that render high performance in processing and storing data. We joined this research effort by proposing a reconfigurable active solid state drives (RASSD) system that deals with such applications, through employing basic hardware, namely FPGA's connected to SSD's, to service the above applications as processing nodes, and take advantage of the close proximity between storage and processing. In this paper, we propose an intelligent middleware system for interfacing workstation-based and mobile applications to the distributed RASSD system. In order to provide high performance in terms of time and functionality, the middleware manages the data processing on the RASSD nodes through special pieces of code that we call drivelets, along with FPGA configuration files (bitstreams). Another important responsibility of the proposed middleware architecture lies in the unguided management of applications' flows, where it uses an intelligent script-parsing mechanism to turn one general request from the client into a sequence of operations needed to generate the required results. The middleware design allows for the integration of mobile applications into the overall architecture of the RASSD system, and allowing them to run data intensive applications that otherwise it is unfeasible for them to execute. We validate our design by comparing it to an existing middleware architecture, and present two use-cases with their results and discussion."
1705035,13990,8228,A heuristic evaluation PDS algorithm for energy-efficient delay constrained scheduling over wireless communication,2012,"Hard energy constraints impose huge challenges to wireless communication under the constraint of communication delay. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy-efficient point-to-point transmission scheduling of delay sensitive multimedia data over a fading channel. We first formulate the transmission scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and systematically unravel it by the optimal solution. We then propose a Heuristic Evaluation Post-decision State (HE-PDS) learning algorithm for the problem of energy-efficient scheduling with respect to the communication delay. This algorithm is based on reformulating the value iteration equation by introducing a virtual state called Post-decision State (PDS). The advantages of the proposed algorithm are that: (i) it exploits only part of the information about the system so that less information needs to be learned than when using conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; (ii) it uses the heuristic function and evaluation function to reduce unnecessary action exploration in the whole search space, which severely limits the adaptation speed and runtime performance of conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; (iii) it chooses actions with favorable purpose and efficiency so as to optimize reward function and enhance convergence speed. We compare our algorithm with the traditional Q learning algorithm and PDS learning algorithm in terms of the energy consumption and transmission delay. The simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm under various scenarios achieves a better trade-off between energy consumption and delay overhead. Moreover, it can converge in a reasonable number of slots for it to be practically useful with satisfaction of delay constraint."
1053181,13990,21855,Estimating end-to-end delays under changing conditions,2013,"We consider the problem of estimating the end-to-end latency of intermittently connected paths in disruption/delay tolerant networks. This is useful when performing source routing, in which a complete path is chosen for a packet to travel from source to destination (when intermediate nodes are really low complexity devices that can only forward packets but cannot perform route computations), or in linear network topologies. While computing the time to traverse such a path may be straightforward in fixed, static networks, doing so becomes much more challenging in dynamic networks, in which the state of an edge in one timeslot (i.e., its presence or absence) is random, and may depend on its state in the previous timeslot. The traversal time is due to both time spent waiting for edges to appear and time spent crossing them once they become available. We compute the expected traversal time (ETT) for a dynamic path in a number of special cases of stochastic edge dynamics models, and for three different edge failure models, culminating in a surprisingly nontrivial yet realistic ``hybrid network setting in which the initial configuration of edge states for the entire path is known. We show that the ETT for this initial configuration setting can be computed in quadratic time (as a function of path length), by an algorithm based on probability generating functions. We also give several linear-time upper and lower bounds on the ETT, which we evaluate, along with our ETT algorithm, using numerical simulations."
1270756,13990,20649,Resource Efficient Mobile Communications for Crowd-Sensing,2014,"Due to continuously growing communication traffic of emerging mobile phone applications, resource-efficient communication is a key to affordable network services with high Quality of Experience. While some communication traffic requires immediate resource allocations (such as voice services), an increasing number of mobile phone applications produce a lot of background communication traffic (e.g. social network apps, crowd sensing services). In this paper we discuss the predictive Channel-Aware Transmission (pCAT) scheme, which leverages the fact, that favorable channel conditions require much less spectrum resource allocation than bad channel conditions. By leveraging the knowledge of user trajectories and recurring spots with favorable channel conditions, the so-called LTE connectivity hot spots, background traffic transmissions can be scheduled by the client according to expected channel quality and application data priority. Thereby, the spectrum consumption of background traffic of applications can be reduced significantly. At the same time, the efficient usage of spectrum resources has also an impact on the battery lifetime of the mobile devices. By introducing the Context-Aware Power Consumption Model (CoPoMo) for LTE communications, we highlight, how decisions about the spectrum resource allocation by the network will impact the battery lifetime. One case study will show, that by simply changing the resource allocation scheme and without the need for spending more spectrum resources, the power consumption can be reduced by more than 70% using the Energy-Efficient Scheduling (EES) introduced in this paper."
2142756,13990,23836,Exploring the Scope of the InfiniBand Congestion Control Mechanism,2012,"In a loss less interconnection network, network congestion needs to be detected and resolved to ensure high performance and good utilization of network resources at high network load. If no countermeasure is taken, congestion at a node in the network will stimulate the growth of a congestion tree that not only affects contributors to congestion, but also other traffic flows in the network. Left untouched, the congestion tree will block traffic flows, lead to underutilization of network resources and result in a severe drop in network performance. The Infini Band standard specifies a congestion control (CC) mechanism to detect and resolve congestion before a congestion tree is able to grow and, by that, hamper the network performance. The Infini Band CC mechanism includes a rich set of parameters that can be tuned in order to achieve effective CC. Even though it has been shown that the CC mechanism, properly tuned, is able to improve both throughput and fairness in an interconnection network, it has been questioned whether the mechanism is fast enough to keep up with dynamic network traffic, and if a given set of parameter values for a topology is robust when it comes to different traffic patterns, or if the parameters need to be tuned depending on the applications in use. In this paper we address both these questions. Using the three-stage fat-tree topology from the Sun Data center Infini Band Switch 648 as a basis, and a simulator tuned against CC capable Infini Band hardware, we conduct a systematic study of the efficiency of the Infini Band CC mechanism as the network traffic becomes increasingly more dynamic. Our studies show that the Infini Band CC, even when using a single set of parameter values, performs very well as the traffic patterns becomes increasingly more dynamic, outperforming a network without CC in all cases. Our results show throughput increases varying from a few percent, to a seventeen-fold increase."
1581449,13990,23712,Energy efficient carrier aggregation algorithms for next generation cellular networks,2013,"Carrier aggregation (CA) is an important feature of next generation cellular networks (LTE-advanced, LTE-A) that allows its users to aggregate upto 100 MHz of (dis-)contiguous spectral chunks to provide increased data rates. While the conventional approach of allowing LTE-A users to be configured on all component carriers, results in maximum diversity gain for scheduling, it also increases the users' power consumption and processing that scale with the number of component carriers. In light of the growing need to minimize energy consumption on mobile devices, we argue that it is possible to operate the LTE-A users on a small subset of component carriers to reduce their energy consumption, without any appreciable loss to the scheduling gain. A key step in realizing this goal however, is to address the joint problem of component carrier selection as well as scheduling and in turn forms the focus of this work. We highlight the hardness of the joint problem when the number of component carriers that can be activated for an LTE-A user is limited. Towards solving the problem, we consider various models that incorporate both contiguous and dis-contiguous CA as well as backlogged and finite user buffers and propose efficient, greedy algorithms with performance guarantees that are also simple to implement. Our evaluations based on LTE system parameters, reveal that our algorithms help realize 80-90% of the maximum scheduling gain with just half the component carriers and provide a 25% throughput gain over baseline load and signal power based carrier selection schemes."
1118126,13990,369,On Precoder Design for Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems,2011,"We investigate the problem of precoding optimization in an amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relay system. Most reported works on this problem focus chiefly on the design of relay precoder without simultaneously optimizing the direct link. In this paper, we propose a method for joint source/relay precoder design, taking both direct and relay links into account. Our design is based on maximizing the mutual information (MI) under limited transmission power constraints at the source and relay, respectively. We first formulate a constrained optimization problem before relaxing the original cost function for tractability and derive a MI lower bound which asymptotically approaches the exact expression of MI in an iterative fashion. In contrast to previous strategies, we then prove that the optimal structure of the source and relay precoders jointly convert the MIMO relay channel into a bank of single-input-single-output (SISO) relay channels without having to assume a beamforming structure to simplify the derivation. Specifically, the linear precoding design problem degenerates into power loading among multiple SISO relay channels. Applying standard Lagrange technique results in a scalar convex optimization which can be readily solved by iterative water filling. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed scheme, either exploiting partial or full channel state information (CSI), significantly outperforms the existing methods."
2618526,13990,8228,Two-Way Training Design for Discriminatory Channel Estimation in Wireless MIMO Systems,2011,"This work examines the use of two-way training to efficiently discriminate the channel estimation performances at a legitimate receiver (LR) and an unauthorized receiver (UR) in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system. This work improves upon the original discriminatory channel estimation (DCE) scheme proposed by Chang where multiple stages of feedback and retraining were used. While most studies on physical layer secrecy are under the information-theoretic framework and focus directly on the data transmission phase, studies on DCE focus on the training phase and aim to provide a practical signal processing technique to discriminate between the channel estimation performances (and, thus, the effective received signal qualities) at LR and UR. A key feature of DCE designs is the insertion of artificial noise (AN) in the training signal to degrade the channel estimation performance at UR. To do so, AN must be placed in a carefully chosen subspace, based on the transmitter's knowledge of LR's channel, in order to minimize its effect on LR. In this paper, we adopt the idea of two-way training that allows both the transmitter and LR to send training signals to facilitate channel estimation at both ends. Both reciprocal and nonreciprocal channels are considered and a two-way DCE scheme is proposed for each scenario. For mathematical tractability, we assume that all terminals employ the linear minimum mean square error criterion for channel estimation. Based on the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimates at all terminals, we formulate and solve an optimization problem where the optimal power allocation between the training signal and AN is found by minimizing the MSE of LR's channel estimate subject to a constraint on the MSE achievable at UR. Numerical results show that the proposed DCE schemes can effectively discriminate between the channel estimation and, hence, the data detection performances at LR and UR."
2208841,13990,10192,A QoS Enhanced Routing Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks,2011,"QoS is a key factor to the utility of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) especially in the case of multiple sources data detecting with different time property. For environment detecting, there are not only same sensors just for one element but also heterogeneous sensors for multiple elements. Sometimes a single sensor has multiple functions to get several elements, which could be indicated to send the elements with different fashion. For example, temperature and humidity need been reported every one hour, but precipitation and wind speed/direction need been reported every half an hour in special situation. A High Available Sensor network protocol for Differentiated Services (HADS) was proposed, which combined the features of Directed Diffusion protocol (DD) and Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy routing protocol (LEACH). HADS computes the routing gradient with different metrics, and then constructs two types of routing gradient table for best-effort service and real-time service. A gateway node was introduced, which can connect two cluster heads and support both single route and multiple routes to achieve an alternate path via other cluster head to sink node. The simulation results shows that HADS protocol may provide a good services for two types of data transmission, and achieve the efficient power utilization and delay improvement within the whole network."

In this paper, we propose mixed cross-layered and learning automata (LA)-based fault-tolerant routing protocol for IOTs, which assures successful delivery of packets even in the presence of faults between a pair of source and destination nodes. As this work concerns IOT, the algorithm designed should be highly scalable and should be able to deliver high degrees of performance in a heterogeneous environment. The LA and cross-layer concepts adopted in the proposed approach endow this flexibility to the algorithm so that the same standard can be used across the network. It dynamically adopts itself to the changing environment and, hence, chooses the optimal action. Since energy is a major concern in IOTs, the algorithm performs energy-aware fault-tolerant routing. To save on energy, all the nodes lying in the unused path are put to sleep. Again this sleep scheduling is dynamic and adaptive. The simulation results of the proposed strategy shows an increase in the overall energy-efficiency of the network and decrease in overhead, as compared to the existing protocols we have considered as benchmarks in this study."
2073367,13990,8228,Distributed scheduling and power control for cognitive spatial-reuse TDMA networks,2012,"We investigate the problem of distributed scheduling and power control for vertical spectrum sharing in spatial-reuse time division multiple access (STDMA) networks. The objective is to minimize the transmission length (in term of time slots) of secondary users (e.g. users in femtocell networks) subject to the interference-limit constraint for primary users (e.g. users in cellular networks) and quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee of secondary users. This problem is known to be NP-complete. We therefore propose a novel distributed two-stage algorithm based on the distributed column generation method to find the near-optimal solution for the transmission schedule. In the first stage, the dual problem corresponding to the transmission length minimization problem subject to the minimum bandwidth requirement of secondary users, called the restricted master problem, is solved to obtain a dual optimal solution at each secondary transmitter. The dual optimal variables are passed to the second stage to solve the pricing problem. The pricing problem here finds a feasible channel access pattern such that the sum of dual optimal variables is greater than 1 subject to the interference constraints for primary users and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for secondary users so that the solution of the master restricted problem can be improved. We also develop a distributed algorithm for solving the pricing problem based on local measurement at each secondary transmitter and a limited number of message exchanges. The proposed algorithm is compared with previously proposed methods and is evaluated in terms of the schedule length and the number of message exchanges."
1000363,13990,208,CodeMP: Network coded multipath to support TCP in disruptive MANETs,2012,"TCP over Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) is challenging due to frequent route breaks, high random errors, and DATA-ACK interference. Network coded multipath approaches have been shown in several previous studies to be an effective transmission paradigms in disruptive networks. However, most of the previous studies either have no adaptive redundancy control or rely on theoretical models that require knowledge at all relays of the entire network state. In this paper, we propose a network coded multipath scheme for conventional TCPCodeMP that adapts to frequent link changes in MANET and requires no explicit control messages. The scheme exploits multiple-path redundancy and maintains total transparency to transport layer protocols. The proposed coding scheme is based on three components: (1) random linear coding scheme with adjustable redundancy, (2) multipath routing, (3) ACK Piggy coding. Simulation results show that in a 3-hop static scenario, the proposed multipath scheme improves TCP flows goodput by 70% compared to our previous single-path scheme. In an extreme MANET scenario where two TCP sessions co-exists and nodes are moving as fast as 25 m/s with up to 40% packet error rate (an environment in which regular TCP collapses completely), CodeMP achieves at least 700Kbps aggregate TCP goodput, with a Jain's fairness index of 0.99."
1474643,13990,8228,Adaptive admission control in interference-coupled wireless data networks: A planning and optimization tool set,2014,"Typically, wireless network performance decreases in high trafoc regimes, e.g., at trafoc hot spots and peak hours, since a large number of active users have to share limited radio resources. From a network perspective, even congestion may occur in some cells, which may lead to drastic deterioration of user throughputs. As a consequence, network operators employ admission control in their base stations in order to prevent congestion and enhance quality of experience. In this paper, we develop an effective network planning and optimization tool set, which considers the dynamic behavior of mobile trafoc. The tool set allows for a more accurate prediction of data request blocking probabilities and data throughputs under admission control, since it explicitly considers the inter-cell interference coupled nature of frequency reuse one networks. This enables more reliable planning and (self-) optimization of wireless networks. We prove utility by applying the tool set to a trafoc-adaptive admission control scheme and compare the resulting network performance with that of static admission control schemes under demands of high mobile data trafoc. We ond that the adaptive algorithm is able to exploit the trade-offs between blocking of requests, reduced interference, and guaranteed resources for individual data transmissions in each of the cells. Under high trafoc conditions, it yields better performance compared to any other static scheme investigated.

719890,13990,208,Data-centric anomalies in sensor network deployments: analysis and detection,2012,"Recent real-world sensor network deployments have helped decision makers and sensor data analysts draw highly precise conclusions by relying on finer-grained raw sensory data. A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM."
1458995,13990,369,WiFiHonk: Smartphone-Based Beacon Stuffed WiFi Car2X-Communication System for Vulnerable Road User Safety,2014,"Despite various high-tech Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications that have been developed for enhancing traffic safety, protecting vulnerable road users (VRU), such as pedestrians and bicyclists from the vehicles and trains still heavily relies on the traditional sound warning method. Furthermore, as smart devices continue to become highly ubiquitous, the more VRU are shutting out the safety related warning sounds. A traffic accident study shows the number of headphone-wearing VRU involved in roadside accidents has tripled since 2004. Although recently a few Car2Pedestrian communication methods have been proposed by various car makers, their practical usage is still in question. They assume VRUs' active attention to the communication while walking, and also mostly require special communication devices to cope with the wide range of mobility. In this paper, we propose a smartphone based Car2X communication system, named WiFiHonk that can alert of potential collisions to both VRU and vehicles in order to especially protect the distracted VRU. WiFiHonk provides a practical safety means for the distracted VRU without requiring any special device using the WiFi of a smart device. It is novel in that it removes the WiFi association overhead using the beacon stuffed WiFi communication and also provides an efficient collision estimation algorithm to issue appropriate warnings. Our experimental and simulation studies validate that WiFiHonk can successfully alert the VRU within a sufficient reaction time frame."
1665272,13990,22260,A Kautz-based Real-Time and Energy-Efficient Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network,2012,"Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) are composed of sensors and actuators to perform distributed sensing and actuating tasks. Most WSAN applications (e.g., fire detection) demand that actuators rapidly respond to events under observation. Therefore, real-time and fault-tolerant transmission is a critical requirement in WSANs to enable sensed data to reach actuators reliably and quickly. Due to limited power resources, energy-efficiency is another crucial requirement. Such requirements become formidably challenging in large-scale WSANs. However, existing WSANs fall short in meeting these requirements. To this end, we first theoretically study the Kautz graph for its applicability in WSANs to meet these requirements. We then propose a Kautz-based Real-time, Fault-tolerant and Energy-efficient WSAN (REFER). REFER has a protocol that embeds Kautz graphs into the physical topology of a WSAN for real-time communication and connects the graphs using Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for high scalability. We also theoretically study routing paths in the Kautz graph, based on which we develop an efficient fault-tolerant routing protocol. It enables a relay node to quickly and efficiently identify the next shortest path from itself to the destination only based on node IDs upon routing failure. REFER is advantageous over previous Kautz graph based works in that it does not need an energy-consuming protocol to find the next shortest path and it can maintain the consistency between the overlay and physical topology. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of REFER in comparison with existing systems in terms of real-time communication, energy-efficiency, fault-tolerance and scalability."
1074354,13990,369,Efficient Continuous Object Tracking with Virtual Grid in Wireless Sensor Networks,2012,"For tracking a continuous object, mass communications are generated in the sensor field because of their huge scale and extensive diffusing property. Due to the severe resource constraints of sensor nodes, the redundant information and communications should be reduced in order to prolong the life time of WSNs. Although there have been numerous studies on continuous object tracking, most of the proposed schemes have focused on reducing the redundant boundary nodes and control messages through static/dynamic clustering in space domain. However, it is not enough to reduce the redundancy only with space domain. Redundantly sampled reporting packets could be a cause of generating redundant long range transmission, which is an important source of energy consumption. For reducing the redundancy, we need to consider not only the method to reduce the redundancy in space domain but also an adaptive sampling scheme in time domain. However, adaptive sampling is difficult to design in continuous object tracking because local sensor nodes hard to figure out how far the continuous object is diffused. To solve this problem, we suggest a new scheme which picturizes the diffusing object by dividing the sensor field into several cells like a pixel on TV and samples reporting time based on pixel image. In addition, we use pictured image of diffusing object for selecting the boundary information of diffusing object in space domain to reduce the redundant boundary information. To present the sensor field as an image, we adopt a virtual grid which divides the sensor field into several cells under the static clustering WSN architecture. The performance of proposed scheme is verified with simulation and the results show that the total number of control messages, reporting packets and boundary nodes can be reduced."
1750478,13990,208,Demo: Modular Wireless Technology Gateway,2013,"With the increase number of wireless standards and the number of wireless enabled devices ranging from smart cell phones to notebooks, the new concept of Internet of Things where every tangible Thing will have an IP address and wireless connectivity is around the corner. In addition, there is a great interest of Cyber-Physical System interconnecting city's infrastructure together though wireless connections from bridges to water pipes to smart grid and intelligent transport systems. Not all of these devices will use the same wireless technology for communication and hence it will be very hard for them to exchange control and data messages. Moreover, different wireless technology standards are being used nowadays in many applications such as Bluetooth, WiFi, WiMAX etc. Each technology has a different stack of protocols, medium access control and encoding mechanisms dictating the way it works, operates and technical specifications. Each technology was proposed, developed and standardized to serve specific needs and applications. For example, Bluetooth standard was developed to interconnect small number of devices available within short distances from each other. WiFi was standardized to provide stations with wireless network connectivity through TCP/IP stack. Devices with same wireless technology can connect together to exchange control and data messages. With the increase number of wireless technologies available for users, one major difficulty is to interconnect different devices with different wireless technology together. For example, it is impossible for a notebook PC to connect to a Bluetooth device without having a Bluetooth dongle."
1379121,13990,8228,28 GHz propagation measurements for outdoor cellular communications using steerable beam antennas in New York city,2013,"The millimeter wave frequency spectrum offers unprecedented bandwidths for future broadband cellular networks. This paper presents the world's first empirical measurements for 28 GHz outdoor cellular propagation in New York City. Measurements were made in Manhattan for three different base station locations and 75 receiver locations over distances up to 500 meters. A 400 megachip-per-second channel sounder and directional horn antennas were used to measure propagation characteristics for future mm-wave cellular systems in urban environments. This paper presents measured path loss as a function of the transmitter - receiver separation distance, the angular distribution of received power using directional 24.5 dBi antennas, and power delay profiles observed in New York City. The measured data show that a large number of resolvable multipath components exist in both non line of sight and line of sight environments, with observed multipath excess delay spreads (20 dB) as great as 1388.4 ns and 753.5 ns, respectively. The widely diverse spatial channels observed at any particular location suggest that millimeter wave mobile communication systems with electrically steerable antennas could exploit resolvable multipath components to create viable links for cell sizes on the order of 200 m."
1456018,13990,8228,Cooperative spectrum sensing with Slepian-Wolf coded cooperations,2012,"A new Slepian-Wolf coded cooperation scheme is proposed for a cognitive radio network with two secondary users (SUs) performing cooperative spectrum sensing through a fusion center (FC). The SUs sense the spectrum by measuring the energy statistics of the received signals. The measured energy statistics are quantized with a Lloyd-Max quantizer at the SUs and forwarded to the FC, which then performs soft combining over the quantized information. This is different from most previous works that forward hard decisions based on local sensing results at the SUs. Due to the wireless nature of the channel, signals transmitted by one SU to the FC will also be observed by the other SU, which can cooperate with the transmitting SU by relaying the observed signals to the FC. In recognition of the strong correlation between the signals observed at the FC and the relay SU, a new asymmetric Slepian-Wolf code is employed at the relay SU to reduce the amount of cooperation information, thus to improve the cooperation efficiency. In addition, we propose to unequally allocate energy among the coded bits to compensate the energy loss due to the redundancy introduced by the coded cooperation, and this yields better performance compared to conventional equal energy coding schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme operating in practical fading channels can achieve a performance that is almost identical to the ideal case with soft combining performed over unquantized energy statistics transmitted through distortion-free channels."
861563,13990,20348,Visual light landmarks for mobile devices,2014,"The omnipresence of indoor lighting makes it an ideal vehicle for pervasive communication with mobile devices. In this paper, we present a communication scheme that enables interior ambient LED lighting systems to send data to mobile devices using either cameras or light sensors. By exploiting rolling shutter camera sensors that are common on tablets, laptops and smartphones, it is possible to detect high-frequency changes in light intensity reflected off of surfaces and in direct line-of-sight of the camera. We present a demodulation approach that allows smartphones to accurately detect frequencies as high as 8kHz with 0.2kHz channel separation. In order to avoid humanly perceivable flicker in the lighting, our system operates at frequencies above 2kHz and compensates for the non-ideal frequency response of standard LED drivers by adjusting the light's duty-cycle. By modulating the PWM signal commonly used to drive LED lighting systems, we are able to encode data that can be used as localization landmarks. We show through experiments how a binary frequency shift keying modulation scheme can be used to transmit data at 1.25 bytes per second (fast enough to send an ID code) from up to 29 unique light sources simultaneously in a single collision domain. We also show how tags can demodulate the same signals using a light sensor instead of a camera for low-power applications."
2295475,13990,8228,10-Gbps IP Network Measurement System Based on Application-Generated Packets Using Hardware Assistance and Off-the-Shelf PC,2011,"Targeting high-bandwidth applications such as video streaming services, we discuss advanced measurement systems for high-speed 10-Gbps networks. To verify service stability in such high-speed networks, we need to detect network quality under real environmental conditions. For example, test traffic injected into networks under-test for measurements should have the same complex characteristics as the video streaming traffic. For such measurements, we have built Internet protocol (IP) stream measurement systems by using our 10-Gbps network interface card with hardware-assisted active/passive monitor extensions based on low-cost off-the-shelf personal computers (PCs). After showing hardware requirements and our implementation of each hardware-assisted extensions, we report how we build pre-service and in-service network measurement systems to verify the feasibility of our hardware architecture. A traffic-playback system captures packets and stores traffic characteristics data without sampling any packets and then sends them precisely emulating the complex characteristics of the original traffic by using our hardware assistance. The generated traffic is useful as test traffic in pre-service measurement. A distributed in-service network monitoring system collects traffic characteristics at multiple sites by utilizing synchronized precise timestamps embedded in video streaming traffic. The results are presented on the operator's display. We report on their effectiveness by measuring 1.5-Gbps uncompressed high-definition television traffic flowing in the high-speed testbed IP network in Japan."
2069762,13990,369,Heuristic Thresholds for Busy Burst Signalling in a Decentralised Coordinated Multipoint Network,2011,"In this paper, a novel decentralised coordinated beamforming technique for interference mitigation in multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. When the available spectrum is fully reused in all cells, the base station (BS) can potentially activate a beam which causes detrimental co-channel interference (CCI) towards mobile stations (MSs) served by neighbouring cells. This problem is solved by requiring each active MS to transmit a busy burst (BB) in a time-multiplexed feedback channel using the spatial precoder utilised for receiving data. Likewise, the BS must scan the feedback channel using the same precoder which it intends to use for transmitting data in the next slot. Provided that channel reciprocity holds, the feedback channel and the data channel become reciprocal. This enables the BS to listen to the feedback channel and ascertain the amount of CCI it potentially causes towards the active MSs if it were to apply the particular spatial precoder. The BS is permitted to utilise only such precoders that cause CCI lower than a predetermined threshold. The impact of the threshold parameter for selecting spatial precoder in cellular networks is investigated and a novel heuristic for setting the thresholds in the downlink (DL) mode is proposed. It is demonstrated that the proposed heuristic achieves a 14% increase in spectral efficiency and a 6.3-fold increase in cell-edge user throughput compared to a transmit beamforming approach without interference awareness."
964769,13990,22021,Universal Polar Codes,2014,"Polar codes, invented by Arikan in 2009, are known to achieve the capacity of any binary-input memoryless outputsymmetric channel. Further, both the encoding and the decoding can be accomplished in O(N log(N)) real operations, where N is the blocklength. One of the few drawbacks of the original polar code construction is that it is not universal. This means that the code has to be tailored to the channel if we want to transmit close to capacity. We present two polar-like schemes that are capable of achieving the compound capacity of the whole class of binary-input memoryless symmetric channels with low complexity. Roughly speaking, for the first scheme we stack up N polar blocks of length N on top of each other but shift them with respect to each other so that they form a staircase. Then by coding across the columns of this staircase with a standard ReedSolomon code, we can achieve the compound capacity using a standard successive decoder to process the rows (the polar codes) and in addition a standard Reed-Solomon erasure decoder to process the columns. Compared to standard polar codes this scheme has essentially the same complexity per bit but a block length which is larger by a factor O(N log(2)(N)/epsilon). Here N is the required blocklength for a standard polar code to achieve an acceptable block error probability for a single channel at a distance of at most ! from capacity. For the second scheme we first show how to construct a true polar code which achieves the compound capacity for a finite number of channels. We achieve this by introducing special  polarization steps which  align the good indices for the various channels. We then show how to exploit the compactness of the space of binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels to reduce the compound capacity problem for this class to a compound capacity problem for a finite set of channels. This scheme is similar in spirit to standard polar codes, but the price for universality is a considerably larger blocklength."

Though broadband internet connectivity will not be universally available in the short-term, widely-employed mobile devices coupled with novel delay-tolerant networking do allow limited forms of connectivity. This paper explores the design space for internet access systems operating with constrained connectivity. Our starting point is C-LINK, a collaborative caching system that enhances the performance of interactive web access over DTN and cellular connectivity. We discuss our experiences and results from deploying C-LINK in Nicaragua, before moving on to a broader design study of other issues that further influence operation. We consider the impact of (i) storing web content collaboratively cached across all user nodes, (ii) hybrid transport layers exploiting the best attributes of limited cellular and DTN-style connectivity. We also explore the behavior of future systems under a range of usage and mobility scenarios. Even under adverse conditions, our techniques can improve average service latency for page requests by a factor of 2X. Our results point to the considerable power of leveraging user mobility and collaboration in providing very-low-infrastructure internet access to developing regions."
1501249,13990,8228,On identifying which intermediate nodes should code in multicast networks,2013,"Network coding has the potential to enhance energy efficiency of multicast sessions by providing optimal communication subgraphs for the transmission of the data. However, the coding requirement at intermediate nodes may introduce additional complexity and energy consumption in order to code the data packets. Previous work has shown that in lossless wireline networks, the performance of tree-packing mechanisms is comparable to network coding, albeit with added complexity at the time of computing the trees. This means that most nodes in the network need not code. Thus, mechanisms that identify intermediate nodes that do require coding is instrumental for the efficient operation of coded networks and can have a significant impact in overall energy consumption. We present a distributed, low complexity algorithm that allows every node to identify if it should code and, if so, through what output link should the coded packets be sent. Our algorithm uses as input the optimal subgraph determined by Lun et al's optimization formulation [13]. Numerical results are provided using common Internet Service Provider (ISP) network topologies and also random network deployments. Our results show that the number of coding nodes in the expectation is very low (typically below 1) and that the number of sessions that require coding is limited, e.g., less than 15% for sessions of 4 receivers for the ISP networks and below 0.1% for networks with random node deployments in a square of 1 × 1 km 2  with of up to 30 nodes and up to 20 receivers."
2484926,13990,208,Distributed Algorithms for Multipath Routing in Full-Duplex Wireless Networks,2011,"Recently Choi et al. designed the first practical wireless full-duplex system, which challenges the basic assumption in wireless communications that a radio cannot transmit and receive on the same frequency at the same time. Along this line, in this paper we study the cross-layer optimization for routing in full-duplex wireless networks, comprehensively considering various resource competitions and constraints. We first propose a collision-free full-duplex broadcast MAC and prove its necessary and sufficient conditions. We then focus on 1) the problem of how to choose routes to maximize the total profit of multiple users subject to node constraints, and 2) the problem of how to choose routes to minimize the network power consumption subject to the minimum user rate demands and node constraints. We formulate these two problems as convex programming systems. By combining Lagrangian decomposition and subgradient methods, we present distributed iterative algorithms to solve these two problems, which compute the optimized user information flow (i.e. user behavior) on the network layer and the optimized node broadcast rate (i.e. node behavior) on the MAC layer. Our algorithms allow each user and each node to adjust its own behavior individually in each iteration. We prove the convergence, and provide bounds on the amount of constraint violation, and the gap between the optimal solution and our solution in each iteration. Our work comprehensively considers various resource competitions and constraints, and provides a theoretical foundation for the future study on full-duplex wireless networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study cross-layer optimization for full-duplex wireless networks."
1559257,13990,20774,The impact of the power law exponent on the behavior of a dynamic epidemic type process,2012,"Epidemic processes are widely used to design efficient distributed algorithms with applications in various research fields. In this paper, we consider a dynamic epidemic process in a certain (idealistic) urban environment modeled by a complete graph. The epidemic is spread among $n$ agents, which move from one node to another according to a power law distribution that describes the so called attractiveness of the corresponding locations in the urban environment. If two agents meet at some node, then a possible infection may be transmitted from one agent to the other.   We analyze two different scenarios. In the first case we assume that the attractiveness of the nodes follows a power law distribution with some exponent less than 3, as observed in real world examples. Then, we show that even if each agent may spread the disease for f(n) time steps, where f(n)=O(log n) is a (slowly) growing function, at least a small (but still polynomial) number of agents remains uninfected and the epidemic is stopped after a logarithmic number of rounds. In the second scenario we assume that the power law exponent increases to some large constant, which can be seen as an implication of certain countermeasures against the spreading process. Then, we show that if each agent is allowed to spread the disease for a constant number of time steps, the epidemic will only affect a polylogarithmic number of agents and the disease is stopped after (\log log n) O(1)  steps. Our results explain possible courses of a disease, and point out why cost-efficient countermeasures may reduce the number of total infections from a high percentage of the population to a negligible fraction."
1370876,13990,8228,Bottom-up trie structure for P2P live streaming,2012,"By simultaneously providing live video and audio contents to millions of users around the world, peer-to-peer live video streaming (P2P LVS) has become one of the most popular Internet applications in recent years. However, current P2P LVS software has problems such as non-smooth playback and long start-up delay for end users. To address these issues, we design a P2P-based multi-bit Trie structure, called Bottom-Up Trie (BU-Trie), for distributing P2P live contents. Different from other approaches, BU-Trie is a Trie formed and built inversely from leaf nodes (or child nodes) back to the root node (or parent node). This architecture consists of two phases: a diffusion phase and a swarming phase. The main design goal of the diffusion phase is to group the local peers together by discovering physical locations of peers, and design the paths for fast distributing live streams from the source node to end users. The objective of the swarming phase is to find an optimal way for exchanging the video stream chunks within a local group. We propose an algorithm called Most Popular Chunk First (MPCF) and apply it for the swarming phase for efficient chunk exchange. Performance evaluation of the proposed BU-Trie shows that, when compared to other approaches, the sequential throughput of video chunks is increased. The inter-domain traffic, the traffic between different Internet service providers (ISPs), is reduced as well. Such a reduction would benefit carriers economically."
2051747,13990,369,Experimental Evaluation on Throughput Performance of Asymmetric Carrier Aggregation in LTE-Advanced,2011,"This paper presents laboratory experimental results on the throughput performance of asymmetric carrier aggregation between the uplink and downlink using an LTE-Advanced testbed. The implemented base station (BS) and mobile station (MS) transceivers have transmission bandwidth capability of up to 100 MHz (5 component carriers (CCs)) and 40 MHz (2 CCs) in the downlink and uplink, respectively. The testbed also features CC-specific adaptive modulation and channel coding (AMC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) functionalities based on the actually transmitted control signaling. The experimental results show that, in the uplink, CC-based AMC using up to 64QAM high-order modulation is effective in increasing the user throughput in multipath fading channels and achieves a throughput greater than 100 Mbps using carrier aggregation with 2 CCs and 1-by-2 SIMO. The results also show that when the uplink control information (UCI) corresponding to 5 downlink CCs is multiplexed onto the uplink shared channel (PUSCH), the required block error rate (BLER) of the UCI below 10-2 is almost satisfied by appropriately setting the offset value, , for adjusting the channel coding rate of UCI although AMC with high-order modulation is applied to the UCI as well. Furthermore, we show that when carrier aggregation with 5 CCs and 2-by-2 MIMO multiplexing are applied in the downlink, high throughput greater than 500 Mbps (thus, half of the 1 Gbps that can be achieved using 4-by-4 MIMO multiplexing) is achieved at the average received signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) of approximately 25 dB when CC-specific AMC considering UCI error is applied"
1093595,13990,369,Suppression of Cyclic Prefix in Down-Link LTE like Systems to Increase Capacity,2013,"In this paper it is presented a proposal to increase the capacity of Down-Link (DL) transmissions in Long Term Evolution (LTE) like systems based on Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The augment of the data rate is achieved with the total or partial suppression of the Cyclic Prefix (CP), which requires the use of a variable number of samples without conveying any information. The proposal is based on an iterative cancellation of the main impairments that the CP suppression supposes, the Inter Symbol and Inter Carrier Interferences. The interference mitigation procedure demands adequate channel estimations obtained in two different stages. Firstly, this new scheme requires the utilization of a preamble symbol appended to the beginning of the data transmission, which enables an initial Maximum Likelihood channel estimation. Secondly, time-variant channels will be estimated using a Least Squares estimator by the use of scattered pilots within the LTE frame structure. Through simulations it has been demonstrated that, despite the interferences arisen due to the CP suppression, our proposal attains adequate channel estimations which converge to theoretical bounds and the overall system obtains values of Bit Error Rate similar to the ideal situation of not suppressing the CP. It is also presented that considering the typical values of CP in the LTE standard the increment of the capacity employing this strategy can range between 7% and 25%."
1575634,13990,8228,A path prediction model to support mobile multimedia streaming,2012,"Along with the recent and ongoing advances in the wireless and mobile access technologies, a wide plethora of mobile multimedia services have emerged. Ensuring an acceptable level of Quality of Service (QoS) is a crucial requirement to allow users enjoy these mobile multimedia services. One means to ensure QoS is to minimize the frequency and magnitude of fluctuations in the mobile multimedia streaming rates during the multimedia service and while users are on the move. For this purpose, there is need for tools to predict a user's long-term movement. In this vein, this paper proposes a Path Prediction Model (PPM) to predict a user's movement path. PPM is based on historical movement trace, current movement data and spatial conceptual maps; it assumes a priori knowledge of the destination. At each road intersection, the probability of selecting the next road segment is evaluated, based on historical data, towards the destination. These probabilities are computed via (a) filtering historical data according to the day of the week (e.g., weekend, holiday) and the time of the day; and (b) applying conditional probability rules taking into account the path used between the origin of movement, current position, and the destination. Simulations are conducted using real-life data to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Encouraging results are obtained in terms of average prediction accuracy and mitigation of the impact of learning period and the remaining distance to reach the destination on the path prediction performance."

713489,13990,8228,Full-duplex wireless communication based on backscatter amplifier,2014,"Abstract—In this paper, we propose a full-duplex wirelesscommunication system by means of reﬂected power. Our conceptis based on backscatter modulation (BM), where electromagneticwaves are modulated, ampliﬁed and reﬂected by the sameantenna that receives them. We consider two nodes that wishto exchange data over wireless additive white Gaussian noisewith Rayleigh fading channel. Within this framework the end-user receives self-interference free signal. The proposed systemincludes negative resistances to guarantee sufﬁcient power forthe demodulator while exhibiting maximal difference in thebackscattered ﬁeld. We analyze the performance of the proposedsystem and evaluate its ergodic capacity. I. I NTRODUCTION Given the ever-increasing demand for high-speed data ser-vices, modern wireless networks will increasingly requiremore efﬁcient strategies for use of the available frequencyspectrum. One key limit to spectrum utilization efﬁciencyinvolves the current practice of half-duplex communication, inwhich a node either transmits or receives a signal in a singlechannel usage. More efﬁcient strategies for use of the availableradio spectrum are needed. Furthermore, communication isasymmetrical and is becoming more so over time. From theview point of trafﬁc symmetry between uplink (mobile to base-station) and downlink (base-station to mobile), data trafﬁcstarted as highly symmetrical with voice services. Overtime,however, it has become markedly imbalanced, with the majorgrowth of new multimedia services being characterized byasymmetric trafﬁc (much higher downlink). Overall trafﬁc pat-terns are also becoming more asymmetrical because the largestbandwidth demand currently derives from downstream TV andInternet video signals [1], [2]. In this paper, we propose adesign for full-duplex wireless communication system, basedon backscatter modulation (BM), that is able to efﬁcientlyaccommodate high downlink trafﬁc.A. Related WorksFull-duplex communication for spectrum efﬁciency.Some recent works have provided experimental evidence andmethodologies for full-duplex communications, in which anode transmits and receives signals at the same time andon the same frequency band [3]–[11]. However, to date, alldemonstrations regarding full-duplex communications havebeen predicated upon the principle that the transmitter and thereceiver must generate their own radio-carrier waves indepen-dently which, in practice, inevitably results in a high level ofself-interference. Several self-interference cancellation mecha-nisms has been then proposed [3]. In contrast to previous full-duplex systems, within the framework of our concept the end-user receives self-interference free signal. Only base stationreceivers suffer from self-interference. As there is no severespace restriction we can place the transmitting and receivingantenna far apart to resolve this problem in the base stationside.Backscatter modulation. The history of backscatter mod-ulation (BM) can be traced to Stockman’s foundation paper[12]. Stockman proposed a point-to-point communication,with the carrier power generated at the receiving end, and thetransmitter replaced by a modulated reﬂector. This principeis based on the reﬂection of electromagnetic waves. It takesadvantage of presence of the reﬂection coefﬁcient variationsat the interface between the transmit antenna and the receiverinput load. By varying the load, the reﬂection coefﬁcientchanges. This setup is capable of modulating data upon theoriginal waveform, which can be received and decoded. Themost prominent application of backscatter modulation is theradio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID). As can be seen in [13]–[18], RFID tags are used as “keys” to open electronic locks,as a means of storing personal information in both creditcards and passports, and as tracking strategies in the shippingindustry. Despite that, backscatter modulation has not, to date,been seriously considered in two-way communication. In thisrespect, BM based approaches have been prevented by oneprimary, but relevant, drawback: it is essentially restricted toshort-range communication.There are two facets to this potentially overcoming challenge:ﬁrst, the end-user doesn’t generate its own radio wave; sec-ond, most of the research studies related to BM have addedadditional power constraints, e.g., many systems rely on theassumption that nodes are passive (battery less) [17]–[20]. Theproposed full-duplex BM system is not predicated on powerconstraints and therefore allows more sophisticated techniquesto be implemented at the end-user to increase the overallcommunication range.B. ContributionThe key departure of our research from prior work on full-duplex systems are (a) our framework is based on backscat-ter modulation and analog network coding, (c) the end-userreceives a signal free of self interference, and (c) negativeresistances are employed to improve the transmission range."

Each clause is a linear Boolean equation (XOR) of a subset of the variables. A K-clause is a clause involving K distinct variables. In the random K-XORSAT problem a formula is created by choosing m K-clauses uniformly at random from the set of all possible clauses on n variables. The set of solutions of a random formula exhibits various geometrical transitions as the ratio m/n varies. We consider a coupled K-XORSAT ensemble, consisting of a chain of random XORSAT models that are spatially coupled across a finite window along the chain direction. We observe that the threshold saturation phenomenon takes place for this ensemble and we characterize various properties of the space of solutions of such coupled formulae."
780218,13990,9589,Subsidization Competition: Vitalizing the Neutral Internet,2014,"Unlike telephone operators, which pay {\em termination fees} to reach the users of another network, Internet Content Providers (CPs) do not pay the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) of users they reach. While the consequent cross subsidization to CPs has nurtured content innovations at the edge of the Internet, it reduces the investment incentives for the access ISPs to expand capacity. As potential charges for terminating CPs' traffic are criticized under the net neutrality debate, we propose to allow CPs to voluntarily subsidize the usage-based fees induced by their content traffic for end-users. We model the regulated subsidization competition among CPs under a neutral network and show how deregulation of subsidization could increase an access ISP's utilization and revenue, strengthening its investment incentives. Although the competition might reduce the throughput of certain CPs, we find that the main cause comes from high access prices rather than the existence of subsidization. Our results suggest that subsidization competition will increase the competitiveness and welfare of the Internet content market; however, regulators might need to regulate access prices if the access ISP market is not competitive enough. We envision that subsidization competition could become a viable model for the future Internet."

An alternative approach to extend this resultto countable inﬁnite sources is proposed. We establish sufﬁcientconditions to guarantee the joint typicality of reproductionsequences of random descriptions that have not been necessarilygenerated from the product of probability measures. Comparedto existing proofs for ﬁnite alphabets, our technique is simplerand self-contained. It also offers bounds on the asymptotic tailprobability of the typicality event providing a scaling law for alarge number of source encoders. I. I NTRODUCTION Consider the distributed source coding problem where twomemoryless sources are compressed separately and sent to acommon decoder over rate-limited links. The decoder wishesto obtain a lossy estimate of the sources with a ﬁdelity crite-rion. This fundamental problem arises in several applications,e.g. distributed storage, sensor networks and caching in wire-less networks. Berger and Tung [1], [2] derived a general innerbound on its rate-distortion region. Each encoder quantizes itsown observation using a noisy reproduction and these valuesare then communicated to the decoder using lossless Slepian-Wolf compression, which recovers them and thus constructsthe sources estimates. The question of optimality of Berger-Tung’s inner bound continues to be of great interest. Bergerand Yeung [3] show that the bound is optimal if at least oneof the sources must be reproduced losslessly. Wagner et al. [4]shown that it is optimal for two-Gaussian sources. Han andKobayashi [5] have established direct coding theorems forseveral separate encoders. In spite of many works, the exactcharacterization of the rate-distortion region still remains open.The proof of coding theorems for multiterminal sourcecoding involve two technical results. The one referred to as theMutual Packing Lemma [6] that provides necessary conditionsto guarantee the success of joint decoding of all reproductionsequences at the decoder. The second is a central result thatis referred to as Generalized Markov Lemma (GML), whichguarantees the joint typicality between all involved sequences.In particular, since encoding is distributed the GML enforces"

We find that even when attempts are made to utilize an industry standard protocol (I2C), necessary protocol modifications for ultra-low power design means that interfacing remains non-trivial. We present a functional 0.4mm × 0.8mm ARM Cortex M0 with 3KB of RAM, 24 GPIOs, and an ultra-low power I2C interface. This chip is part of the Michigan Micro Mote (M3) project, which is designed to build a complete software and hardware platform for general purpose sensing at the millimeter scale. We demo an I2C interface circuit allowing commercial hardware to program and interact with the chip and present the beginning of the millimeter scale sensing revolution."
822930,13990,8235,On the link(s) between “D” and “A” in Mobile Data Analytics,2013,"This paper addresses the issue of (meta) management of the efficiency in the realm of applications relying on Mobile Data Analytics (MODA). We postulate that considering the efficient execution of the tasks of gathering, storing/retrieving and querying spatio-temporal data separately from the efficiency of executing control and decision-making (or, for that matter, even model-selection) algorithms may not be the most beneficial avenue in MODA settings. We argue that an important component is the management of the dynamics of the different tradeoff(s) and, more importantly, linking them when orchestrating the processes of the data management and analytics. Towards that end, we present the DNA2 (Data's Natural Associations with Analytics) hypothesis for coupling the data and control aspects in MODA contexts. We discuss in detail the role of uncertainty, along with some aspects of declarative specifications for merging the reactive and the pro-active behavior in MODA."
2319396,13990,30,Fall Detection With Multiple Cameras: An Occlusion-Resistant Method Based on 3-D Silhouette Vertical Distribution,2011,"According to the demographic evolution in industrialized countries, more and more elderly people will experience falls at home and will require emergency services. The main problem comes from fall-prone elderly living alone at home. To resolve this lack of safety, we propose a new method to detect falls at home, based on a multiple-cameras network for reconstructing the 3-D shape of people. Fall events are detected by analyzing the volume distribution along the vertical axis, and an alarm is triggered when the major part of this distribution is abnormally near the floor during a predefined period of time, which implies that a person has fallen on the floor. This method was validated with videos of a healthy subject who performed 24 realistic scenarios showing 22 fall events and 24 cofounding events (11 crouching position, 9 sitting position, and 4 lying on a sofa position) under several camera configurations, and achieved 99.7% sensitivity and specificity or better with four cameras or more. A real-time implementation using a graphic processing unit (GPU) reached 10 frames per second (fps) with 8 cameras, and 16 fps with 3 cameras."
1024364,13990,20348,A real-time auto-adjustable smart pillow system for sleep apnea detection and treatment,2013,"Sleep apnea, which is a common sleep disorder characterized by the repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep, can result in various diseases, including headaches, hypertension, stroke and cardiac arrest, as well as produce severe consequences such as impaired concentration and traffic accidents. A traditional diagnosis method of sleep apnea is polysomnography, which can only be conducted in sleep center with specialized personals, thus is expensive and inconvenient. Moreover, it is only used for understanding the conditions, without treatment function. Some other methods or devices have been developed to alleviate sleep apnea, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and intraoral mandibular advancement device and surgery. However, they only provide a treatment method without detection or monitoring function. There is no existing device which can provide both apnea detection and treatment functionality. In this paper, we propose and implement a smart phone-based auto-adjustable pillow system, which enables both sleep apnea detection and treatment. Sleep apnea events can be detected in real-time using the blood oxygen sensor, accordingly, the height and shape of the pillow can be automatically adjusted to terminate the sleep apnea event. On the other hand, after the adjustment, the sensor can continuously monitor the blood oxygen signal to evaluate the effectiveness of the pillow adjustment and to help in selecting a suitable adjustment scheme. Therefore, a real-time feedback control system is formed. Besides, compared with existing diagnosis or treatment devices, our system is non-invasive, inexpensive and portable, which can be used at home or during traveling. In this paper, a real-time sleep apnea detection and classification algorithm is proposed to decide whether the pillow should be adjusted or not. We also design a real-time feedback pillow adjustment algorithm, to decide when and how to adjust the pillow and how to evaluate the effectiveness of the adjustment. We conducted experiments on 40 patients, which demonstrate that using our novel smart pillow system, both the sleep apnea duration and the number of sleep apnea events are dramatically reduced by more than 50%."

While existing solutions propose to take advantage of recent developments in mobile and sensor technologies to encourage users to lead healthier lives, we still lack a viable approach that motivates user participation. In this paper we aim to integrate fitness challenges into the daily routine of users, in order to motivate them to participate more frequently. We develop GeoFit, a mobile app that enables users to discover and add novel fitness challenges in their proximity. In addition to achievement badges, GeoFit relies on top-k lists to motivate users to become top performers. Since participation incentives may also raise cheating concerns, GeoFit leverages GPS and accelerometer sensors of the mobile device to verify the authenticity of fitness challenges performed by users. We have implemented and tested GeoFit on Android devices. Our experimental results show that the GeoFit client imposes only little overhead on the user device, while the server side can support hundreds of client interactions per second."

We firstly introduce the concept of sensing centroid, which is the geometric center of a sensing sector to simplify the pending problem. Particularly, we regard sensing centroid as artificial fish (AF), and search an optimal solution in the solution space by simulating fish swarm behaviors (such as prey, swarm and follow) with a tendency toward high food consistence. Fully considering that AFs have to satisfy both kinematic constraint and dynamic constraint in the process of motion, we propose a Constrained Artificial Fish-Swarm Algorithm (CAFSA), and discuss the control laws to guide the behaviors of AFs with high convergence speed. Finally, we evaluate the effect of some primary parameters on the performance of our solution through extensive simulations."
806828,13990,9475,Continuous-time distributed convex optimization on weight-balanced digraphs,2012,"This paper studies the continuous-time distributed optimization of a sum of convex functions over directed graphs. Contrary to what is known in the consensus literature, where the same dynamics works for both undirected and directed scenarios, we show that the consensus-based dynamics that solves the continuous-time distributed optimization problem for undirected graphs fails to converge when transcribed to the directed setting. This study sets the basis for the design of an alternative distributed dynamics which we show is guaranteed to converge, on any strongly connected weight-balanced digraph, to the set of minimizers of a sum of convex differentiable functions with globally Lipschitz gradients. Our technical approach combines notions of invariance and cocoercivity with the positive definiteness properties of graph matrices to establish the results."

However, the high overhead incurred by providing the necessary fidelity limits the size of the emulated networks considerably. The use of multiple cores provided by modern hardware can significantly improve the speed of emulation but requires synchronization algorithms to preserve causality. Based on the well-known multithreaded event-driven emulator Avrora, we investigate a number of synchronization methods including an algorithm that does not require any locks to improve the performance. We show that both the speed and the scalability can be significantly improved without sacrificing correctness. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of modern CPU technologies such as simultaneous multithreading on emulation performance."
1324311,13990,208,Curve-Based Planar Graph Routing in Multihop Wireless Networks,2011,"Scalability of routing algorithms is a critical issue in large multihop wireless networks. In this sense, approaches like localized geographic routing are very promising. Existing schemes base routing path construction on faces defined by the planar graph of the network. Once running on a particular planar graph, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces. Basically, our face routing extension now follows a sequence of faces intersected by any curve we can freely adjust. We motivate our work by discussing application scenarios that benefit from our scheme and suggest basic mechanisms for choosing appropriate curves. We further present preliminary results from an implementation of our curve-based routing scheme."
1396042,13990,208,Collaborative Location Privacy,2011,"Location-aware smart phones support various location-based services (LBSs): users query the LBS server and learn on the fly about their surroundings. However, such queries give away private information, enabling the LBS to identify and track users. We address this problem by proposing the first, to the best of our knowledge, user-collaborative privacy preserving approach for LBSs. Our solution, MobiCrowd, is simple to implement, it does not require changing the LBS server architecture, and it does not assume third party privacy-protection servers; still, MobiCrowd significantly improves user location-privacy. The gain stems from the collaboration of MobiCrowd-ready mobile devices: they keep their context information in a buffer, until it expires, and they pass it to other users seeking such information. Essentially, the LBS does not need to be contacted unless all the collaborative peers in the vicinity lack the sought information. Hence, the user can remain hidden from the server, unless it absolutely needs to expose herself through a query. Our results show that MobiCrowd hides a high fraction of location-based queries, thus significantly enhancing user location-privacy. To study the effects of various parameters, such as the collaboration level and contact rate between mobile users, we develop an epidemic model. Our simulations with real mobility datasets corroborate our model-based findings. Finally, our implementation of MobiCrowd on Nokia platforms indicates that it is lightweight and the collaboration cost is negligible."
2211694,13990,339,Kargus: a highly-scalable software-based intrusion detection system,2012,"As high-speed networks are becoming commonplace, it is increasingly challenging to prevent the attack attempts at the edge of the Internet. While many high-performance intrusion detection systems (IDSes) employ dedicated network processors or special memory to meet the demanding performance requirements, it often increases the cost and limits functional flexibility. In contrast, existing software-based IDS stacks fail to achieve a high throughput despite modern hardware innovations such as multicore CPUs, manycore GPUs, and 10 Gbps network cards that support multiple hardware queues.   We present Kargus, a highly-scalable software-based IDS that exploits the full potential of commodity computing hardware. First, Kargus batch processes incoming packets at network cards and achieves up to 40 Gbps input rate even for minimum-sized packets. Second, it exploits high processing parallelism by balancing the pattern matching workloads with multicore CPUs and heterogeneous GPUs, and benefits from extensive batch processing of multiple packets per each IDS function call. Third, Kargus adapts its resource usage depending on the input rate, significantly saving the power in a normal situation. Our evaluation shows that Kargus on a 12-core machine with two GPUs handles up to 33 Gbps of normal traffic and achieves 9 to 10 Gbps even when all packets contain attack signatures, a factor of 1.9 to 4.3 performance improvements over the existing state-of-the-art software IDS. We design Kargus to be compatible with the most popular software IDS, Snort."

By using the monitors on the edge network to record the traffic information in a Sketch matrix, we can get the suspicious attack traffic information as the local detection result. Then, all the monitors that have found suspicious information about the same destination IP organize into an AutoTree to collaborative aggregate the local detection result. The local detection information will be aggregated in the AutoTree step by step, while the root of the AutoTree will be in charge of the final decision for the target confirmation. In order to verify the proposed method, we do the experiments in a simulated network. We compare the detection time, detection rate between three detection methods: Collaborative Distributed Detection (CDD), Routing Distribution Based Detection (RDBD) and Single Point Detection (SPD)."

With a novel binary sparse indicative vector (SIV) representing the support of joint SSSR of array covariance matrices, this SIVR-JSRACM algorithm presents high resolution, low computing complexity without knowing the number of sources and initial source positions estimates in advance. However, its performance degrades significantly along with the number of sources increases. To overcome this shortcoming, we proposed an improved joint sparse representation of array covariance matrices (IJSRACM) algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is that we estimate the elements in K-sparse covariance matrix of the potential sources. Thus we could get a new dictionary for SIV. The simulation results demonstrate that the SIVR-IJRSACM algorithm has superior localization accuracy and strong robust to noise under different numbers of sources and also remains the advantages of the SIVR-JSRACM algorithm listed above."
1260420,13990,208,Collaborative Computing On-demand: Harnessing Mobile Devices in Executing On-the-Fly Jobs,2013,"Systems employing mobile devices (e.g., sensors, smart phones, robots) are emerging with growing capabilities in performing a wide variety of tasks. Due to their abundance and wide deployments, they are posed to play a dominant role in providing a rich mobile computing platform for various jobs, especially for new ones that are created on-the-fly. Realizing this platform is challenging since it is hard to predict the exact equipment present in an environment, what types of information need to be communicated to the devices to execute their tasks, and how to reprogram these devices. This work proposes a new on-demand collaborative computing framework that maps a new job as a set of tasks onto the mobile devices for execution. The mapping is done in a manner that takes into account the capabilities of the devices, the dependency between the tasks, the adjacency of the devices, and the requirements of the requested new job. Our proposed framework is implemented as a test-bed in our Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems lab with MICAz sensors and iRobot Create robots."

All these purposive strategic attacks eventually run out of the throughput which results in network crashes. In this paper, we have proposed a two-level dynamic Bayesian game model to recognize these purposive strategic attacks in MANETs and establish a malicious nodes detection system isolating such attacks. The simulation results have demonstrated that the detection method can effectively enhance cooperation performance and maintain packet forwarding rate under the purposive strategic attacks. Besides, through two-level decision, the system performs well in reducing the missing/false alarming rate, especially suitable for large proportion of malicious nodes in MANETs."
1142997,13990,208,A Synergy of the Wireless Sensor Network and the Data Center System,2013,"In recent years, data centers have emerged to be an increasingly important computing infrastructure. It is shown that wireless sensor networks (sensor nets) can provide fine-grained measurements in data centers, and achieve better control of the data center platform for energy efficiency. However, the usage of sensor nets has so far been limited to auxiliary functions, such as sensory data collection across a data center. We argue that the combined computational and networking capability of a sensor network enables it to interact with the clusters in a much more sophisticated way and enhance essential functions in a data center. We have designed a Cluster-Area Sensor Network (CASN) to improve the cluster management and operational security in the system. Implemented with TelosB motes, CASN can be easily deployed in a cluster, with sensor nodes attached in an ad hoc manner to servers, and provides key system functions including cluster-wide command dissemination and verification of physical presence. Experimental results show that CASN has 85% success rate in verifying physical locations of servers with coarse-grained localization when the threshold is 3 meters, and incurs small latency in cluster-wide command dissemination."

1478998,13990,339,Protecting location privacy: optimal strategy against localization attacks,2012,"The mainstream approach to protecting the location-privacy of mobile users in location-based services (LBSs) is to alter the users' actual locations in order to reduce the location information exposed to the service provider. The location obfuscation algorithm behind an effective location-privacy preserving mechanism (LPPM) must consider three fundamental elements: the privacy requirements of the users, the adversary's knowledge and capabilities, and the maximal tolerated service quality degradation stemming from the obfuscation of true locations. We propose the first methodology, to the best of our knowledge, that enables a designer to find the optimal LPPM for a LBS given each user's service quality constraints against an adversary implementing the optimal inference algorithm. Such LPPM is the one that maximizes the expected distortion (error) that the optimal adversary incurs in reconstructing the actual location of a user, while fulfilling the user's service-quality requirement. We formalize the mutual optimization of user-adversary objectives (location privacy vs. correctness of localization) by using the framework of Stackelberg Bayesian games. In such setting, we develop two linear programs that output the best LPPM strategy and its corresponding optimal inference attack. Our optimal user-centric LPPM can be easily integrated in the users' mobile devices they use to access LBSs. We validate the efficacy of our game theoretic method against real location traces. Our evaluation confirms that the optimal LPPM strategy is superior to a straightforward obfuscation method, and that the optimal localization attack performs better compared to a Bayesian inference attack."
1540802,13990,208,Direct Localization of Multiple Sources in Sensor Array Networks: A Joint Sparse Representation of Array Covariance Matrices Approach,2013,"A novel sparse representation based multi-source localization method is presented in this work. We envision a wireless network infrastructure containing multiple phase arrays of acoustic sensors. With multiple arrays, direct estimation of a set of source locations is achieved using a new joint sparse representation of array covariance matrices (JSRACM). This representation transforms the source location estimation problem into a spatial sparse signal representation (SSSR) optimization problem. To mitigate the high computation complexity of JSRACM, a novel binary sparse indicative vector (SIV) is introduced to represent the support of joint SSSR of array covariance matrices. As such, the multiple source locations may be estimated by solving an unconstrained optimization problem of the SIV vector using existing FOCUSS-like algorithms. The resulting SIVR-JSRACM algorithm does not require prior information of the number of sources nor initial source location estimates. It promises super-resolution, robustness to noise, and low computing complexity which is independent of the number of sensor phase arrays. Simulation results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed algorithm."
1263347,13990,208,An Iterative Method of Sensor Calibration in Participatory Sensing Network,2013,"With widespread usages of smart phones, participatory sensing becomes mainstream, especially for applications requiring pervasive deployments with massive sensors. However, sensors on smart phones are prone to the unknown measurement errors, requiring automatical calibration among uncooperative participants. Current methods need either collaboration or explicit calibration process. However, due to the uncooperative and uncontrollable nature of the participants, these methods fail to calibrate sensor nodes effectively. We investigate sensor calibration in monitoring pollution sources, without explicit calibration process in uncooperative environment. We leverage the opportunity in sensing diversity, where a participant will sense multiple pollution sources when roaming in the area. Further, inspired by EM (Expectation Maximization) method, we propose a two-level iterative algorithm to estimate the source presences, source parameters and sensor noise iteratively. Our algorithm can converge to the optimal estimation of sensor noise, where the likelihood of observations is maximized."
2110738,13990,208,An Indoor Hybrid WiFi-VLC Internet Access System,2014,"Visible light communications (VLC) is emerging as a new alternative to the use of the existing and increasingly crowded radio frequency (RF) spectrum. VLC is unlicensed, has wide bandwidth, supports new levels of security due to the opacity of walls, and can be combined to provide both lighting and data communications for little net increase in energy cost. As part of a lighting system, VLC is ideal as a downlink technology in which data are delivered from overhead luminaries to receivers in the lighting field. However, realizing a symmetric optical channel is problematic because most receivers, such as mobile devices, are ill-suited for an optical uplink due to glare, device orientation, energy constraints. In this paper we propose and implement a hybrid solution in which the uplink challenge is resolved by the use of an asymmetric RF-VLC combination. VLC is used as a downlink, RF is used as an uplink, and the hybrid solution realizes full duplex communication without performance glare or throughput degradation expected in an all-VLC-based approach. Our proposed approach utilizes a software defined VLC platform (SDVLC) to implement the unidirectional optical wireless channel and a WiFi link as the back-channel. Experiments with the implemented prototype reveal that the integrated system outperforms conventional WiFi for crowded (congested) multiuser environments in term of throughput, and demonstrate functional access to full-duplex interactive applications such as web browsing with HTTP."
1116961,13990,208,MAP: Authenticating Multiple-Tags,2011,"The prevalence of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology requires Privacy-Preserving Authentication (PPA) protocols to combat the privacy leakage during authentication. Existing PPA protocols employ the per-tag authentication, in which the reader has to sequentially authenticate the tags within the detecting region. Such a processing pattern becomes a bottleneck in current RFID enabled systems, especially for batch-type processing applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient authentication protocol, which leverages the collaboration among multiple tags for accelerating the authentication speed. We also find that the collision, usually considered as a negative factor, is a helpful media to enable collaborative authentication among tags. Our protocol, termed as Multiple-tags privacy-preserving Authentication Protocol (MAP), authenticates a batch of tags concurrently with strong privacy protection and high efficiency guarantee.

We present a set of algorithms that build upon space syntax, which predicts natural movement patterns by interacting with pre-built static environments. We design these algorithms for three assumption categories that represent the spectrum of assumptions regarding the underlying environment and node capabilities. We adopt a data-driven approach to evaluate the performance of our algorithms when compared to other state-of-the-art solutions within each representative category that make similar assumptions. Overall, our results show the great promise space syntax based algorithms have for efficiently guiding messages towards the destination. We show 5% to 20% success rate improvement compared to selected well known state-of-the-art forwarding algorithms within each assumption category while reducing the cost in terms of message replicas by up to 10%."
740324,13990,208,Detecting spectrum misuse in wireless networks,2012,"In contrast to conventional static fixed-width channel allocation, on-demand dynamic variable-width channel allocation has shown that it can effectively improve the fairness, throughput, and spectrum efficiency of wireless networks. Air-time utilization (the percentage of time spent on transmissions) is often used to characterize the spectrum demand of networks. The higher the airtime utilization of a network is, the more spectrum the network should be allocated to. Normally, if all wireless devices in a network utilize spectrum effectively, the airtime utilization can faithfully reflect the spectrum usage. In practice, however, spectrum can be ineffectively used due to the misconfiguration of wireless devices, such as inappropriate bit rate configuration, conservative transmit power setting, or mismatch between channel-width and bit rate. The misconfiguration not only degrades the performance of its local network, but also causes the inflation of local network's airtime utilization and thus results in an unfair spectrum allocation. To address the problem, we present Pinokio, a system that monitors spectrum usage at access points, detects spectrum misuse and improves spectrum efficiency. Our extensive evaluations suggest that Pinokio can accurately detect spectrum misuse, and limit the inflation of airtime utilization from more than 730% to less than 20%."
1737948,13990,208,Energy-Efficient Opportunistic Collaborative Sensing,2013,"This paper studies mobile sensing in a complete distributed and opportunistic scheme. We present a novel sensing strategy for sensing nodes without movement constraints. This strategy offers information sharing and sensor scheduling that maximizes the benefits from collaboration between the nodes. We evaluate the strategy with two real world datasets, where mobile devices sense the surroundings and share the information with nearby devices via Bluetooth. We show that data sharing of energy-hungry sensing (e.g., GPS) via nearby devices can save a substantial amount of energy. Moreover, we formulate the offline measurement scheduling as a non-linear optimization problem and compare the offline optimal results with our online scheduling performance."
745822,13990,208,Simultaneous Sensing Matrix and Sparsifying Dictionary Optimization for Block-sparse Compressive Sensing,2013,"In this paper, we propose a new method to optimize the sensing matrix and the overcomplete dictionary simultaneously in a block-sparse system. This method mainly includes two parts: the optimization of the sensing matrix for a given dictionary and the optimization of the overcomplete dictionary with a block structure for a predefined sensing matrix. Simulation results show that our novel method can significantly improve the dictionary recovery ability and lower the representation error compared with other dictionary learning methods in block-sparse systems."
1576586,13990,208,Orthogonal cut algorithm for value-based event localization in sensor networks,2012,"We investigate the capability of ad-hoc sensor networks equipped with simple sensor devices to enable a more accurate spatial event localization in order to support smart camera networks. We present a novel algorithm named Orthogonal Cut which is suitable for many different event detection scenarios, especially when large interferences occur. It estimates the spatial position of a detected event by dividing the surveillance space of a sensor network into smaller areas until a threshold criteria is met."
1283113,13990,208,Trust Models in Wireless Sensor Networks and Online Social Networks: A Comparative Study,2014,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are networks based on on the cooperation of small-sized nodes. Those nodes are mainly characterized by their low energy consumption, low cost, and wireless communication, Meanwhile, online social networks (OSNs) are becoming a popular way to meet people and keep in touch with friends. To improve the security performance in WSNs and the service quality in OSNs, trust models are commonly incorporated in both network environments. In this article, we present the first comparative study of trust models in WSNs and OSNs. We first provide a comparison of the features of WSNs and OSNs, and we provide a simple discussion of trust management in WSNs and OSNs. Next, we review and compare existing trust models for WSNs and OSNs in the literature. Finally, we conduct some discussion and point out the future directions, especially on how to enhance the trust management in a network by learning from the other type."
1004236,13990,208,Underwater Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks using WLAN at 2.4 GHz,2011,"In order to have long distance underwater wireless communications, low frequencies must be used. But the main problem when using low frequencies is the lack of bandwidth to transmit high data rate. Sometimes wireless sensors must be placed quite close for taking more accurate measurements from the water, so higher frequency bands could be used in special cases. In this paper we measure the maximum coverage distance of underwater wireless sensors when they are placed at about 15 cm underneath the water surface, without having wireless coverage from the air side. Then, we measured the number of lost packets and round trip time for 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbps at different frequencies for different distances."
